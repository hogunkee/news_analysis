4,STI,"SunTrust Banks (STI) and other superregional bank stocks drifted closer to buy zones on Tuesday, leaders on a down day for the broader stock market. After the close, the House voted to ease some post-crisis restrictions on the financial industry.XThe bill, which waters down some Dodd-Frank curbs put in place after the financial crisis a decade ago, will largely help smaller banks. Still, giant bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) were forming bases, while Morgan Stanley (MS) was near a buy point.The Republican-controlled House approved the measures. It is largely expected to pass, and would then arrive at President Trump's desk to be signed into law. The bill cleared the Senate in March.Under the bill, banks would need to have at least $250 billion in assets to be considered systemically important to the financial system, well up from the current requirement for $50 billion. Banks with such a designation are subject to more regulations, including the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Democrats warn that lifting the restrictions could lead to a repeat of the risky behavior that got banks into trouble a decade ago.Separately, regulators are reportedly considering changes to the Volcker Rule that would remove some curbs on short-term trading.SunTrust rose 1.2% to 69.59 on the stock market today.

11,STI,"Netflix (NFLX) has turned heads in Hollywood by spending billions of dollars to lure filmmakers and viewers from rival TV networks. But it's also frustrated competitors in a less-public way: by poaching talent and driving up pay.The streaming giant has lured scores of defectors by offering big increases in compensation. Recruits are securing as much as double their pay, including stock and other benefits, people familiar with the matter say.With $10 billion for programming and marketing this year — and a stock that's vying again to lead the S&P 500 — Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix is upending the way people get paid in Hollywood. TV networks and studios are struggling to keep up with a rival who will spend $300 million on a top producer like Ryan Murphy and pay lavishly further down the food chain.""With combinations of base, bonus, equity and long-term incentive, new-media companies are figuring out ways to beat traditional studios,"" said Neal Lenarsky, founder of STI Management, which represents executives in the media industry.Old Hollywood is trying to respond. Some studios have pulled back from selling shows to the online service. Walt Disney (DIS) went so far as to yank its movies from the company and is launching streaming services of its own. 21st Century Fox (FOX) sued in 2016, claiming the company induced executives to breach their contracts. Netflix countersued, and the case is inching along.None of that is stopping Netflix from attracting publicists with as much as $400,000 in salary and other compensation, or about double their prior paychecks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private compensation data. More senior professionals are seeing similar increases, said one executive who was approached by Netflix.In making offers, Netflix estimates a candidate's value based on experience and title, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing company policy. Then it pays the recruit at the top of what the corresponding range might be. The company also allows candidates to take as much a 50% of their compensation in options, they said. A recent change in California law bars employers from asking applicants about their prior salary.Titles at Netflix don't necessarily correspond with Hollywood convention. For the most part, the company has just three executive roles — director, manager and vice president — and some represent real promotions for people jumping over. Netflix also lets some staffers see what co-workers earn via an internal database, according to the people.And while many studios reward employees with amenities like a large personal office and titles that seem to confer prestige, almost no one at Netflix has an office. Not even Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who co-founded the company.Netflix employed more than 5,400 people at year-end, fewer people than its competitors in media, and sales are projected to reach $15.8 billion this year. CBS (CBS), owner of the CBS and Showtime TV networks, has a payroll of more 12,000 and revenue projected at $14.5 billion this year.Perhaps nowhere is Netflix more aggressive than in marketing and public relations. The company will spend about $2 billion promoting its service and shows this year. The company lists almost 500 openings on its website, with about a third in Los Angeles and more than 50 in marketing and PR.Once wholly dependent on older movies and TV shows licensed from other companies, Netflix will release 700 original programs this year, including 80 movies. A growing share is produced in-house by Netflix Studios, based in the company's Hollywood offices.Producing and promoting those shows requires an expanding legion of employees, from colorists to sound engineers to publicists. Netflix is looking to hire dozens of executives for production and postproduction jobs, and still more for marketing.Experienced staffers are in short supply, forcing Netflix to raid rivals who also happen to be programming suppliers. Last year, Netflix hired Bela Bajaria, formerly with Comcast's (CMCSA) Universal Television, to oversee unscripted TV, as well as Scott Stuber, a producer based at Universal Pictures, to run feature films. Julie Fontaine, executive vice president of movie publicity at Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA), jumped to a similar post. The company has recruited dozens of PR people from agencies and studios including Fox and Disney.

14,STI,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio. Custodian banks, like Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and Northern Trust (NTRS) would be the likeliest to benefit.But JPMorgan and Citi, which also handle similar deposits, argue that provision should apply to them as well. Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today. Bank of America dipped 0.1%, Citigroup lost 0.5%, Goldman Sachs rose 1.5%, Morgan Stanley gained 1.9%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 0.9%%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisAmazon Looking At Ways To Offer Branded Checking AccountJPMorgan Forecasts Q1 Trading Rebound After Sluggish 2017

18,STI,"U.S. stocks were little changed in midday action Wednesday, despite President Trump's disruptive plan regarding Jerusalem and a Senate committee's backing of a partial rollback in Dodd-Frank.X The Nasdaq crept 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 was just barely above flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today was below the previous session's pace.Trump is expected to announce that the U.S. is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This would make the U.S. the first country to do so. The U.S. would then eventually move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.On a quieter note, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee approved a bipartisan rollback to parts of the Dodd-Frank law in a 16-7 vote Tuesday. Four Democrats on the panel voted with the majority. The rollback has the support of nine Democrats in the Senate, and initial support from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Yellen's replacement Jerome Powell.The bipartisan legislation doesn't involve a full repeal.The bill would raise the trigger for more intense regulation of financial firms from the current $50 billion in assets to $250 billion, thus easing the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions. This would benefit firms such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), which rose five sessions in a row before pulling back Tuesday and so far Wednesday; SunTrust Banks (STI), which rose six sessions in a row before its pullback; and American Express (AXP), which advanced six sessions in a row, going into Wednesday's session.Major money centers such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) would not get a break. At midday, all three were down slightly.Bank stocks, including the big players, have benefited on the belief that the Federal Reserve will crank interest rates at least a quarter point after the Fed meets Dec. 12-13. CME Group's FedWatch Tool estimates the odds of a rate hike at 100%. The only difference is between those who expect a quarter-point hike (90.2%) and those who see a half-point increase (9.8%).A half-point increase would be a bold move, and the Ben Bernanke/Janet Yellen Fed isn't known for boldness.In recent sessions, the chipmakers, chip designers and chip-equipment makers have fallen 9% to 14% off their highs. As of Tuesday's close, the chip sector fell to No. 8 among 33 sectors — its worst ranking of the year.Speculation among market watchers swirls around two views: Either chip stocks will offer a buying opportunity when they stop falling and rebound or their leadership position will be turned over to some other sector such as banks and financials.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, solar and steel producers led the upside.

19,STI,"U.S. stock indexes rushed in opposite directions midday Wednesday, as blue chips and banks showed strength while the Nasdaq staggered lower.X At 12 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average pegged a 0.2% gain, while the S & P 500 inched down 0.2%. The Nasdaq fell 1.3%, pulled down by the Philadelphia semiconductor index's more than 4% loss.Small caps surged with the Russell 2000 adding 0.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly up. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, financials led. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) popped 2.5%. Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.9%. American Express (AXP) grabbed a 1.5% gain, but Visa (V) dived 3.5%.American Express is bouncing off its 10-week moving average line, while Visa is testing its 50-day line.Bank stocks were up midday Wednesday after rising Tuesday on the testimony of Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve nominee for chief. Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that  he favors easing bank regulations. Powell's confirmation hearing was smooth, disturbing neither senators nor Wall Street.Among the bank sector, stocks notching 52-week highs included JPMorgan; Morgan Stanley (MS), up 2.5%; Bank of America (BAC), up 3%; SVB Financial (SIVB), up 2.5%; Comerica (CMA), up 4%; and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), up 4%. Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) is closing in on a 76.24 buy point but cleared an alternative entry at 74.95 in strong volume this morning.Two additional bank-stock breakouts included Northern Trust (NTRS), up 2.5%; and SunTrust Banks (STI), up 4%.A convergence of factors appear to be favoring some sectors at the expense of others. Tech is suffering but other areas are rising. In Tuesday's new highs list, the building sector delivered 29 new highs; banks, 27; and finance, 22. Chips only accounted for two new highs.Factors influencing the strong side of the stock market include: Trump's choice to head the Fed, who is finding favor; the Republican tax-cut package which won tentative but positive remarks from maverick Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine; and recent economic data, including a 17-year high for consumer confidence.Before the open Wednesday, the bulls received additional good news. The second reading on Q3 GDP rolled in at 3.3%, up from the initial reading of 3%. While this only matched the consensus estimate, the growth was encouraging and signaled no trouble in the economy.Besides the gains in bank stocks, the retail sector also surged in midday action. Retail industry groups accounted for a slew of the day's top performers. Some of the retail stocks are comeback stories. Urban Outfitters (URBN), a former leading stock that has been struggling for more than two years, is on track for its 11th daily gain in a row. Urban is climbing the right side of a deep cup base.On the loss side, the three chip groups were among the worst performers for the day.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech As Apple, FANG Stocks Down; Telcos RallyFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipBitcoin Jumps Over $11,000Why The 10-Week Line Can Be An Investor's Best FriendStock Market Today: Could These 4 Retailers Jam In 2018?

20,STI,"Stocks diverged sharply Wednesday, with small caps and the Dow Jones industrial average closing higher while the Nasdaq composite and much of the technology sector was routed.XThe Nasdaq tumbled 1.3%, its largest one-day loss since Aug. 17, as investors took profits on the technology winners that have fueled much of the year's market gains. Semiconductor, data storage, software, internet and networking industry groups slid 3% to 7% and were among the 20 worst-performing industry groups.The S&P 500 was off a fraction and the Dow closed 0.4% higher as both made new highs in the session. Volume increased across the board, according to early figures. Losers equaled winners on the NYSE. Despite the Nasdaq's losses, winners led by 3-to-2, indicating that the selling was concentrated on select industries.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX), an ETF that tracks the Philadelphia semiconductor index, skidded 4.4% and was one of the most heavily traded shares Wednesday.Dents were visible in some technology leaders, including the FANG stocks. Facebook (FB) lost 4% in big volume, but managed to hold near the 50-day moving average. A modest gain from its 175.59 buy point is now nearly entirely gone. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) not only stumbled but also had the highest volume since their big upside moves at the start of this month or late October.Nvidia (NVDA), another stock with far more volume than usual, plunged 7% and has undone about six weeks of gains. Nvidia now needs to show it can rebound from the 50-day line.The tech-sector rout overshadowed a fine day for retail, finance and other sectors, where there were dozens of breakouts.Department stores, auto parts chains, office supply stores and supermarkets were the four best-performing industry groups in today's market. Airlines, shipping and airfreight made the transportation sector another solid performer.Superregional and regional banks extended this week's rally. Zions Bancorp (ZION), Webster Financial (WBS), SunTrust Banks (STI), Trustmark (TRMK), Regions Financial (RF) and Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) were some banks that broke out past buy points.In investment banking and brokers, Raymond James Financial (RJF) and Stifel Financial (SF) also saw breakouts.The strength in financials helped the Russell 2000 outperform, adding 0.3%.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech, Investors Rotate To Banks, Value StocksWhat's The General Direction Of The Market?

21,STI,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C) and other financials such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) continued their rally on Wednesday, amid greater optimism over tax reform and the U.S. economy as well as signs the U.K. and European Union were coming closer to a settlement on their planned separation.X JPMorgan Chase popped 2.3% to 103.73 in the stock market today; the stock is extended from a 95.32 flat-base entry. Tuesday's rebound from the 50-day moving average offered a possible new buying opportunity, though investors should try to buy 50-day/10-week rebounds as quickly as possible.Goldman Sachs climbed 0.8% to 241.36, near a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base and moving above its 50-day line in strong volume.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are key reasons why the Dow industrials rallied and the S&P 500 was nearly flat as the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled.Citigroup rose 1.8% to 75.04. Citigroup is closing in on a 76.24 buy point but cleared an alternative entry at 74.95 intraday after powering above its 50-day line Tuesday.Bank of America (BAC) advanced 2.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) climbed 1.8%, also still within buy range of a cup-with-handle base with a 48.59 buy point.Two bank breakouts included Northern Trust (NTRS), up 2%, and SunTrust Banks (STI), up 3.15%.Charles Schwab climbed 2.7% to 48.42. Schwab is just within range of a 46.31 buy point of a flat base cleared on Tuesday. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) climbed 1.7%, now extended.Several factors appeared to be driving the rally in financials.The GOP's tax-cut plan on Tuesday cleared the Senate Budget Committee along party lines, moving the bill closer to a full vote in the chamber. A full Senate vote could come this week.The bill, which would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, is likely to contain a tax-raising mechanism that would kick in if the benefits from the tax cuts don't pan out as expected, easing concerns about the debt.But other GOP lawmakers are opposed to that mechanism. The Senate bill also still needs to be fused together with the House's.Jerome Powell, who President Trump has chosen to succeed Janet Yellen as head the Federal Reserve, said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that ""the case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together"" while also stressing that he sees no sign of economic ""overheating."" The next policy meeting takes place on Dec. 12-13.When the Fed raises the rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other to meet financial quotas, banks pass the higher costs on to consumers, often through raising rates on their own loans. The higher rates help improve banks' financial results.Meanwhile, Powell hinted that he favors relief on financial rules. While not a surprise, the combination of steady of monetary policy and regulatory relief is positive for banks.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose Wednesday. That rate also influences the rates on credit that banks offer to their customers.Wall Street has been concerned about the flattening of the yield curve, a gauge of inflation expectations that tracks the difference between short-term and long-term government debt. Earlier this month, the gap between the short end and long end of that curve was at its narrowest in a decade, raising concerns about a weaker economy. The yield spread widened slightly on Wednesday.The short end of that curve has crept up as the Fed raises rates. When Wall Street expects the economy to be stronger in the years ahead, the long end of the curve rises, as future economic growth raises prices and investors demand a greater return on their bonds to make up for the declining buying power of the dollar.Rising yields were definitely a factor Wednesday. Dow financials JPMorgan, Goldman and American Express (AXP) rallied, but Visa (V) fell sharply. Visa doesn't hold credit balances, so higher rates don't offer a benefit.The U.K. and the EU are reportedly coming closer to agreeing on what the island nation will pay to get out of the bloc. The payment could run into the tens of billions of euros, according to CNN. The pound jumped on the breakthrough, which mean the U.K. and EU can now address their post-divorce trading and regulatory relationships.The pound tanked last year after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Concerns were also raised about U.S. banks that use London as a launchpad into the rest of Europe to do business.Wall Street is dumping highflying tech stocks on Wednesday, from Netflix (NFLX) to Lam Research (LRCX) to Chinese internets.

IWS gained 3% from a late January breakout from a previous flat base to its March 1 high.The $10.4 billion fund, which tracks the index with the same name, turned 16 years old in July. As such, it provides exposure to midsize U.S. companies that are deemed undervalued by the market relative to comparable peers.

23,STI,"Bank of America (BAC),  JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Suntrust Banks (STI) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) all topped buy points Wednesday, at least intraday, as the Trump-backed GOP tax plan boosted Treasury yields and the stock market generally. Several other big banks are close to entries, while Citigroup (C) continued to rise after breaking out earlier this month.XThe tax reform would slash the corporate rate to 20% from 35%, while reducing personal income tax rates. Banks would benefit from the lower tax rates directly, as well as from stronger economic growth and the resulting impact on Federal Reserve and market interest rates.The continued courting of buy points by bank stocks comes a week after they neared buy zones following the Fed's still-bullish for raising interest rates and its decision to slim down its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Market expectations of a Fed rate hike in December have risen significantly over the past two weeks, rising to 81% on Wednesday from 72% on Tuesday and just 38% a month ago.JPMorgan Chase rose rose 1.6% to 95.18 in the stock market today, closing just below a 95.32 flat-base buy point after moving to 95.72 intraday.Bank of America advanced 2.4% to 25.41, just below a 25.45 buy point with a shallow base.

26,STI,"A strange-bedfellows mix of Democrats and Republicans have called for resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking.For most of the 20th Century the law held back Main Street banks and shielded the big Wall Street banks from those smaller competitors. Why would anyone want that old problem back again?Democrats have blamed the law's 1999 repeal for causing the 2007-2008 financial crisis, while some Republicans have latched onto the old government mandate as a way to protect Main Street banks and consumers from Wall Street abuses. Both of these notions are dead wrong.The financial crisis was not caused by allowing commercial and investment banks to be owned by the same parent corporation. The institutions that failed were either predominantly commercial or investment banks, but not both.The commercial banks that failed, such as Wachovia, Washington Mutual and IndyMac, did so because they invested in subprime mortgages. The investment banks that got into trouble, such as Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, had no commercial bank affiliations.The excessive risk-taking that lead to bank losses occurred in mortgage lending and securitization (the repackaging of pooled assets into securities), completely legal practices that would have occurred even under a Glass-Steagall regime.In fact, separating banking activities would have increased the severity of the crisis. Investment banks that found themselves in liquidity crunches, such as Merrill Lynch, were able to be acquired by larger deposit-taking institutions, namely Bank of America, rather than go bankrupt.Further, when Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were under stress to acquire short-term funding, they were allowed to quickly reorganize into financial holding companies with commercial banking arms. The ability of these institutions to diversify their activities sheltered the financial system from further losses.The most-integrated banks, those with both commercial- and investment-banking arms, were the strongest during the crisis. This remains the case today. The most recent Federal Reserve stress tests show that the banks that engage in unified banking, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), are in fact the healthiest.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two banks that concentrate primarily on investment banking, came the closest to failing on key measurements. Simply separating bank activities does not make the financial system any safer, nor would have it prevented the 2007-08 crisis.The second mistake of Glass-Steagall proponents is their claim that they are ""taking on Wall Street."" In reality, piling on complex regulations only serves to enrich well-connected big banks at the expense of smaller ones. Glass-Steagall systematically destroyed Main Street investment banking over its 66-year reign.Prior to the government-imposed firewall, many commercial banks in cities throughout the country were active in securities underwriting and distribution.For example, the Trust Company of Georgia, predecessor of SunTrust Banks (STI), organized a stock offering of Coca-Cola (KO) in 1919. Local residents of Atlanta, who celebrated not having to sell out to ""New York interests,"" subsequently bought nearly half of Coca-Cola's stock.That would not be possible under Glass-Steagall. The firewall forbade local commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, relegating the latter to specialized firms in New York.Bringing back a failed government policy would only redistribute assets and activities among the existing big banks. The 10 largest banks would all remain designated as ""too-big-to-fail"" under a new Glass-Steagall, with the pure investment banks such as Goldman Sachs growing to become more systemically important, as American Enterprise Institute scholar Paul Kupiec has found.It is little wonder then why Gary Cohn, the director of President Trump's National Economic Council and former Goldman Sachs executive, is in favor of the measure.The real solution to today's financial woes is opening up the financial services sector to greater competition. House Republicans have been moving in the right direction by passing the Financial Choice Act this year, which would allow Main Street banks to grow their communities while removing Wall Street's protections.If the Senate does its part to pass the bill and send it to the President to sign, that is a policy that will foster an efficient and stable financial system that all Americans can rely upon.

27,STI,"Stocks on Wednesday continued Tuesday's broad rally after the Fed held interest rates steady, as widely expected.XThe rally lifted a number of small-, mid- and large-cap ETFs near or past their buy points, including Oppenheimer Large Cap Revenue (RWL) and iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value (IWS).RWL gapped up past a 47.06 flat-base buy point Tuesday and closed a penny below the entry. If it holds above the buy point Wednesday, that would mark its third flat-base breakout this year.Shares were up 8.6% year to date through July 24, according to Morningstar Inc., vs. the S&P 500's 11.6% return. The ETF slightly lags the benchmark index for the past one and three years, but its five-year average annual return is in line at 15.9% vs. 15.5%.The $700.9 million fund, which tracks the S&P 500 index, re-weights the companies by their revenue. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was its top holding as of July 24, with a near 5% weighting. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and Apple (AAPL) were next, at about 2.2% each.RWL carries a 0.39% expense ratio.IWS also advanced Tuesday and closed just below its flat-base buy point — in this case 85.43. The fund, which marked its 16th year last week, has gathered $9.6 billion in assets.The ETF's largest sector-weightings as of July 21 were in financial services, at 18%; real estate, at 15%; consumer cyclical, at 12%; and roughly 11% each in industrials and utilities. Technology made up less than 7% of assets. Top holdings included real estate investment trust Prologis (PLD), diversified utility Sempra Energy (SRE) and SunTrust Banks (STI).IWS has underperformed the S&P 500 for the year-to-date, one-year and three-year periods. But it's outpaced the benchmark index with a 15-year average return of 11.7%, ahead of the S&P 500's 9.7% gain. The fund has a 0.29% expense ratio.Tuesday's picks eased slightly as techs made a weak showing. But PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) continued to hold above a 144 flat-base buy point, while First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weight (QQEW) remained just below a 55.30 flat-base entry.Key U.S. index ETFs were higher Wednesday as the Fed held rates steady. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) was up 0.4%, PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) 0.2% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) held a fractional gain.Gold miners, energy and chip funds led sector gainers. VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) advanced 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively.

28,STI,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

29,STI,"XNow that the top U.S. banks have passed the first round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, investors will look to the second round next week, when banks' plans for returning capital to shareholders will be approved.Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck, in a research note this month, estimated that Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) alone have a combined $79 billion in extra capital. And she said the gross payout of dividends and buybacks from most of the banks being tested could rise to 95% of yearly earnings, up from 84% last year.The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, comes out Wednesday and evaluates banks' capital cushions as well as risk-management procedures and plans for dividends and buybacks.Before then, banks could hear back on the prospects of their capital-distribution plans. If those they don't pass muster, the banks can rework the plans to boost their odds of passing.For the banks that pass, investors can generally expect a flood of announcements from banks boosting their dividends and buybacks.But the Wall Street Journal pointed out that Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS) scored relatively low on the supplementary leverage ratio, potentially hurting their payouts. The ratio, which was reported for the first time in the first-round results released Thursday, measures total leverage, including off-balance sheet exposures.Shares of JPMorgan closed down 0.2% at 86.86 Friday, still near an 89.23 entry from a double-bottom base. Bank of America fell 0.5% to 22.82, near a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point. Morgan Stanley dropped 2.1% to 43.69, further below a 46.08 entry. Goldman Sachs finished 1.2% lower at 217.19, after dipping below its 50-day average Thursday. Citigroup eased 0.3%, still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Investors this year are hoping for higher payouts — in the form of dividends and stock buybacks — as banks bulk up on more capital and get used to the tests.Meanwhile, the first round of tests showed the nation's biggest banks have enough capital to continue lending in an economic meltdown. The results contain quantitative data on how the 34 banks being tested this year would hold up under different economic downturn conditions. None failed the test.This year, the most dire of the economic scenarios includes 10% unemployment, falling Treasury rates, a 25% drop in house prices and a 35% drop in commercial real estate prices through the first quarter of 2019. It also includes ""severe recessions"" in the eurozone, the U.K. and Japan, and a ""marked growth slowdown in developing Asia.""Under the worst-case scenario, the Fed estimates the 34 banks tested would suffer aggregate losses of $493 billion over nine quarters and requires banks to have a minimum 4.5% common equity tier 1 capital ratio — a gauge of a bank's high-quality capital in relation to risk-weighted assets. The stress test results released late Thursday showed the nation's top banks met that standard and then some.Ally Financial (ALLY) came the closest to the 4.5% minimum, with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%. KeyCorp (KEY) had 6.8% and SunTrust Banks (STI) 7.1%.U.S. banks began taking the stress tests in 2009 in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis a year earlier in which the financial industry cratered and swallowed a big part of the economy with it.RELATED:How Much Will JPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Goldman Pay Shareholders This Year?Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading Revenue

30,STI,"X Stocks deepened their losses into the close on Wednesday, as the latest accusations against the White House stirred deepening uncertainty in the nation's capital.The Nasdaq sliced 2.6% lower, its worst loss since June. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each lopped off 1.8%, the worst session for both since the Sept. 9 sell-off that followed comments from Federal Reserve officials that all but assured a rate hike that month.Volume roared, up significantly on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.The trigger appeared to be news reports that notes by former FBI Director James Comey during a February meeting with President Trump, just after National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had resigned, portrayed the president pressing the director to drop the agency's probe of Flynn. Trump fired Comey on May 9. The White House has so far given conflicting reasons for Comey's firing.Markets in Europe carved out sizable losses, with the CAC 40 in Paris ending down 1.6% and Frankfurt's DAX taking a 1.4% loss.Fiber-optic stocks had some of the day's worst losses. Oclaro (OCLR) tanked 9.5% and Lumentum Holdings (LITE) skidded 8%. Finisar (FNSR) unraveled 9% and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) caved 5.5%.Superregional and investment banks were also hit hard. SVB Financial (SIVB) and SunTrust (STI) shed 6% apiece. So did Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC). Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 5%. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and Comerica (CMA) dived 6% apiece.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan (JPM) presented the worst losses among Dow industrials. Apple (AAPL) soured 3%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) logged the strongest gain among blue chips, up 0.4% despite the U.S. Department of Justice launching its second suit against the Medicare Advantage provider in less than a month, alleging more than $1.1 billion in billing fraud.Colgate Palmolive (CL) squeezed out a 6% gain to lead the S&P 500, after news reports said CEO Ian Cook had said he'd be open to selling the company at $100 per share. The comment, which valued the personal products company near $88 billion, reportedly was made during a conference with institutional investors.Chipmakers scored the worst losses among S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks. Micron Technologies (MU) dived 7% to mark the bottom of both lists. Nvidia (NVDA) also dropped 7%, ending a five-day breakout rally. It's now negative for the week.Among companies reporting quarterly earnings, both Jack in the Box (JACK) and Qiwi (QIWI) rattled off 6% gains. Qiwi pared its early 12% gain to end in buy range above a 20.42 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.RELATED: Earnings Distractions From Trump Crises: Investing Action PlanWhich Three Sectors Are Seeing Gains Despite Market Sell Off?

31,STI,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

33,STI,"Stocks kept a lustrous shine with an hour to go in Monday's bullish advance. IBD-style breakouts showed oomph, adding to the argument that it's still a good market for growth investors.The current outlook, as seen in the IBD Big Picture, has remained ""Uptrend under pressure"" for months due to a high distribution day count. Watch to see if that outlook changes after Monday's market close.The Nasdaq composite gained 1.2%, bolstered by gains in the chip, computer, data storage, telecom gear and software industries. But the NYSE composite slightly outperformed, up almost 1.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both rallied around 1.1%.Volume was running nearly 9% higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday and a tad lower on the NYSE. Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly stock and index options.Within the S&P 500, banks and select names in the consumer goods, industrial and automotive sectors led the way as at least 18 names rallied 3% or more. They included Star Wars toy supplier Hasbro (HAS) (up 6% to 101.70 on a 42% jump in first-quarter earnings per share), SunTrust Banks (STI), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Delphi Automotive (DLPH) and shirt maker PVH Corp. (PVH).Delphi and PVH both retook their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, respectively, a sign that institutions are gaining more confidence in consumer-oriented industries. Hasbro is showing excellent action since it displayed an earnings-inspired breakaway gap on Feb. 6, clearing an 88.06 early entry in the process.Hasbro spent just 10 days below the 50-day line prior to Monday's buying rush, and volume spiked nearly five times its 50-day average of 1.13 billion shares. The move back above the 50-day line serves as a chance to add shares to a winning position in the stock.Hasbro's Composite Rating of 81 is hampered in part by a decent but not great EPS Rating of 89. Yet after Monday's quarterly results, watch to see if the toymaker's ratings go up at IBD Stock Checkup. Plus, the stock's RS line powered into new high ground, a good sign.Also on the upside, recent breakouts by lithium metal miner Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM) of Chile, Fortinet (FTNT) and Macom Technologies (MTSI) showed gusto. SQM jumped nearly 2.5% to 36.50, holding above a recent flat-base breakout at 34.94.SQM is expected to grow full-year profit 34% to $1.42 a share on a 5% lift in revenue to $2.04 billion.Fortinet, which joined IBD Leaderboard several weeks ago, added to Friday's solid gain, rising 1% to 39.93. The security software play and midcap name is now almost 4% past a 38.43 proper buy point. Don't chase stocks that are already more than 5% past the proper entry.Fortinet gets strong ratings from IBD, including a 90 Composite Rating and an 84 RS. Macom, which gapped up at the open and rose 3.7% to 53.66, boasts even stronger proprietary ratings (98 Composite, 88 RS, 95 EPS) as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. The stock is rapidly rising past a 52.32 entry on a five-month cup with handle.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Fortinet's first-quarter earnings up just 7% to 16 cents a share, a significant decline from gains of 88%, 27%, 29% and 67% in the prior four quarters. The difficult year-over-year comp is one factor. However, keep in mind that the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm smashed Wall Street consensus views in three of the past four quarters. In those three periods, the average beat was 32%.Macom's base features a less than 20% decline from the cup's high to low, well within the normal range for excellent versions of this tried-and-true bullish stock chart pattern. The cup with handle allows investors to time their buys at the point where a stock is best poised to break out and run to new highs. When a stock is at new highs, every investor is happy, except the short sellers.On the downside, Rite Aid (RAD) continued to slump badly, down 2% to 3.72. News reports continue to focus on the rising chance that pharmacy chain rival Walgreens Boot Alliance (WBA) will not be able to merge. Rite Aid, which sports a terrible EPS Rating of 11, is expected to post an 83% plunge in 2017 earnings to 4 cents a share.

36,STI,"X Thanks again, Janet. It came as no surprise for the U.S. central bank to push interest rates up a tad. The real surprise came in the language that wrapped the announcement. In its press release following a nearly unanimous decision to increase the fed funds rate by a quarter-point to a 0.75%-1% target range, the Janet Yellen-led…

37,STI," The market sell-off showed little signs of applying the brakes in the dying minutes of Tuesday's session. Banking, biotech and select metals firms including steel production and metal ores led the decline.With minutes left in the session, the Nasdaq composite accelerated its drop in the final hour of trading, falling 1.8% as large and megacap techs retreated. It's clearly going to be the Nasdaq's biggest single-session drop since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The S&P 500 was down nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average provided no relief as it too fell more than 0.9%. Volume expanded sharply vs. Monday, meaning that it is likely to be a true distribution day, or session of intense professional selling.A spate of four or five such distribution days is enough to end a bull market, or at the minimum trigger a mild correction in the range of 5% to 10%.Small caps took bigger hits as the Russell 2000 fell more than 2.6% and dipped back into slightly negative ground for the year. In 2016, the popular small-cap equity index rallied 19.5%. Major Wall Street banks sold off on growing concern about what impact Britain's future exit from the eurozone will have on London's status as a major banking center.Goldman Sachs (GS), which announced that it will move hundreds of employees out of the United Kingdom capital in preparation for the changes, dropped 8.32 points, or more than 3%, and slumped sharply below its 50-day moving average. Volume was running about 26% above average levels.The Wall Street bank, which has thrived by recent movement in U.S. Treasury bonds, is triggering its first major sell signal since breaking out of a long first-stage base with a 172.52 buy point in late October. The gain reached as high as 48%, big enough to have justified taking profits on the way up.One could decide to sell at least half a position bought at the proper entry, then see if the Dow Jones industrials component can rebound back to its 50-day line. For now, shares are trading less than 9% below the 255.15 high.Fellow money-center banks — Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY), as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) — are also down between 0.5% and 4% and showing weak action near their respective 50-day lines. Superregional lender SVB Financial (SIVB) took out its 50-day moving average for the first time since its early October breakout from a large bottoming-style base. Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif., firm slumped more than 6% to 175.84 in more than double average trade. At its 198.83 peak, SVB rose as much as 76% from the 112.93 handle entry.Also in IBD's superregional bank industry group, Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) and SunTrust Banks (STI) of Atlanta dropped more than 5% in heavy turnover and triggered the 50-day line sell rule.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a top-rated company in IBD's West/Southwest bank group, got slammed with a 7% drop to 47.05, also sinking below its 50-day line in volume running nearly four times usual levels.The stock also triggered the golden rule of selling by falling more than 7% below a recent new flat base entry at 50.82.IBD 50 stocks were not immune to the blanket-like sell-off.China's top internet video game firm NetEase (NTES) slid nearly 4% to 282.59. Yet for now, the stock is holding above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and keeping the air pocket created by an earnings-inspired Feb. 16 big gap up in price. The stock is also still extended more than 5% past a 257.78 cup-with-handle entry point.Cognex (CGNX) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) both fell more than 2% in heavy trading. The former has already gained more than 50% since clearing a 53.55 flat-base entry, while the latter pulled back near a 48.05 flat-base buy point. Yet Veeva has also risen significantly since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 28.05 in May 2016.Keeping gains by selling at least half the position after the rally has exceeded 20% to 25% is a smart portfolio management technique for your growth stocks.On the upside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is staging an eighth straight up-day, rising 1% to 112.93. That pushed the gaming resort operator's advance to 8% past a 104.49 buy point, in a choppy cup-with-handle base — so shares are extended. Wynn has large operations in Macau, the island territory of China where casino gambling is legalized. Wall Street sees full-year profit rising 27% to $4.29 a share in 2017, then up another 16% to $4.99 in 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow-30 Stocks?When To Sell A Stock: Take Profits When 2 Or More Key Rules Get TriggeredWhen To Sell A Stock II: Use The 50-Day Moving Average As A Guide

38,STI,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell slightly in Sunday evening trading. Dow futures edged down 0.1% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.2%.The major averages all rose slightly in the past week, with the Nasdaq composite briefly setting an all-time high on Friday.But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow industrials components, retreated last week, along with Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and a slew of other banks. Several bank stocks, notably Goldman and Morgan Stanley, are testing their 50-day moving averages.The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal faster interest rate hikes after Wednesday's expected quarter-point increase buoyed most stocks. But banks sold off as Treasury yields fell, especially at the high end. Lower yields and a flatter curve between short- and long-term maturities hurts banks' borrow short, lend long profit model.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks often are sensitive to interest rates swings, but not all: Here's a big-cap financial stock that in buy range now.JPMorgan, which gapped up at the beginning of March as investors priced in the March 15 Fed hike, fell about 1% in Friday stock market trading, essentially at its lowest levels of the month, but still not too close to its rising 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs sank 1.7% to 243.92 on Friday, closing just above its 50-day line. So did the other big pure-play investment bank Morgan Stanley, which retreated 2.8% Friday.Bank of America sank 1.4% on Friday, but is comfortably above its 50-day line. BofA tested its 50-day in early February, then had a solid advance through March 1.Citigroup, which was one of the few big banks to trade below its 50-day line earlier this year, fell 1.3% to 60.37 on Friday. Citigroup crossed a 61.73 buy point several times this month, but never closed above that level.PNC Financial (PNC) is approaching its 50-day line, Regions Financial (RF) briefly undercut that level on Friday, while BB&T Corp. (BBT), Keycorp (KEY) and Suntrust Financial (STI) all closed the week below that support area.Keep in mind that in most of these cases, the stock are not far multi-year highs.In Asian Monday intraday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose to its best levels since 2015. Stocks also edged higher in China, while falling in Australia and South Korea. Japan's Nikkei was closed for Monday.RELATED:These Are The 5 Biggest S&P 500 Stocks In Buy Range NowThe Big Picture: 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Points

39,STI,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

It's currently sitting just 7% off its high.

Meanwhile, Fed officials' comments and recent economic data have reinforced expectations for central bank tightening by the end of the year.Banks and bank stocks should do well if the Fed raises rates because it allow them to increase the spread between its lending rates and borrowing costs. Banks' net interest margins have been squeezed in recent years.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), meanwhile, also rebounded off its 50-day.

Wells Fargo is still reeling from the cross-selling scandal.IBD'S TAKE: The Banks-Money Center industry group, which includes the big banks, moves in tandem with the Federal Reserve's announcements on interest rates. To learn more about top industry groups and taking profits quickly rapid changes in the market, see this story about Swing Trading strategies. Meanwhile, some super-regional banks also have broken out. SunTrust Banks (STI) broke past a 44.71 buy point of a consolidation pattern begun in late May on Tuesday. On Wednesday, SunTrust rose 2.2% to 45.73, still in range. SunTrust had found resistance several times just above 44 in recent months.Meanwhile, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% to 49.21 Wednesday, extended from buy range but still performing solidly.Wednesday's bank stock gains come as ADP reported that companies added 154,000 jobs in September, short of estimates for 170,000 but still solid. Meanwhile, the ISM nonmanufacturing index shot up to an 11-month high last month. On Monday, ISM's manufacturing index signaled a return to factory expansion.RELATED:New High Analysis: Session Yields Slew Of Financial BreakoutsU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain EmbraceJPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Waver As Rates To Stay Lower For Longer

49,STI,"Banks retreated Thursday, testing buy points as Treasury yields fell ahead of earnings from Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) out Friday.Treasury yields were down Thursday after a weaker-than-expected trade report out of China sent investors toward government bonds and other safe assets. Investors have bid financials in recent weeks on the prospect of Federal Reserve rate hikes and the recent rise of long-term yields around the world. JPMorgan fell 0.6% to 67.74 on the stock market today after dropping as low as 66.82, just above the 50-day line. The stock is still in range from a buy point of 65.08, cleared in early August.JPMorgan is expected to report a 17% drop in third-quarter earnings but revenue is seen rising 2% to $23.988 billion when it announces quarterly results Friday.Citigroup shares dipped 0.5% to 48.47 after sinking intraday to 47.54, below a recent 48.24 buy point. Analysts see Citi's Q3 EPS falling 15% on Friday to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344 billion. Wells Fargo shares slid 1.3% to 44.75 well below its 50-day and 200-day lines. The bank has its own issues after a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau review found employees may have opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without consumers' permission. Late Wednesday, Wells said CEO John Stumpf stepped down, effective immediately, replaced by President and COO Tim Sloan.Bank of America (BAC) is slated to report results Monday, Goldman Sachs (GS) Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Wednesday. BofA shares fell 1.25%, continuing a recent slide after peeking into buy range on Monday. Goldman lost 1.1% and Morgan Stanley 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: U.K.'s Brexit, bad loans at Italian banks and legal troubles from Germany's Deutsche Bank have opened the European market to U.S. banks. Regional banks, more directly dependent of lending than global Wall Street banks, were also under pressure Thursday.Comerica (CMA) shares fell 1.4% to 47.91, still in buy range, with a 46.40 buy point, out of a cup with handle base but falling toward its 50-day line.SunTrust Banks (STI) shares tumbled 2.1% to 44.76 falling toward its 50-day line but still in buy range, above its buy point of 44.42, after consolidating out of a flat base.Regions Financial (RF) stock fell 2.8% to 9.95, finding support at its 50-day line and off session lows of 9.78, but below its buy point of 10.10.RELATED:Bank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain Embrace

Smith (AOS), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Central Garden & Pet (CENTA) were some of the defensive names top funds were buying in their latest reporting periods.Other industrial-materials stocks that were looking good included metal fabricators Gibraltar Industries (ROCK) and Worthington Industries (WOR).Top funds held a big stake in Chinese internet retail giant Alibaba Group (BABA). Forty-seven leading funds bought the stock, investing an estimated $417 million, in their latest reporting periods. After clearing a consolidation in mid-August, Alibaba has continued its trek north, notching new 52-week highs.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Best Mutual Funds Of 2016 award winning manager Michael Carmen of Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund explains why he has been building his stake in Alibaba in this IBD report.IBD saw 11 top-performing funds snap up Gibraltar Industries, investing an estimated $18.4 million.

The firm also raised its full-year 2016 EPS guidance in the range of $1.37-$1.47.After hitting a 52-week high of 40 on Aug. 8, Gibraltar has been working on a fourth-stage flat base, trading within buying range of 40.10.The country's leading funds have been getting rid of some big household names in their latest reporting periods, including internet search giant Alphabet (GOOGL), online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) and credit card processor MasterCard (MA).  Banking stocks -- such as Bank of America (BAC), SunTrust Banks (STI) and Morgan Stanley (MS) -- were also on the cut list.RELATED:Top Funds' Latest Sells.

53,STI,"Bank stocks are holding up relatively well amid a sharp market sell-off Friday as more Federal Reserve officials prime the U.S. for a potential interest-rate hike. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) remained the only big-bank stock within buy range as of Friday afternoon.JPMorgan Chase fell 0.9% to close at 66.65 in the stock market today, as it was downgraded on Friday by Macquarie Research. But it's still above a 65.08 buy point cleared in early August from a handle in a consolidation.Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Friday that waiting too long to raise rates could damage the economy.""My personal view, based on economic data that we have received to date, is that a reasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual normalization of monetary policy,"" Rosengren said to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, Quincy, Mass.Several other policymakers have made similar comments. But Rosengren had long been considered a policy dove. His comments raised the odds of a September-meeting rate hike, but most investors see the next move in December.The Fed rate-hike buzz is a headwind and a tailwind for bank stocks. Rate hikes would probably help banks boost net interest margins. But with the general market selling off, it's hard for financials to advance.IBD'S TAKE: Bank earnings are long gone, but Fed news -- and key economic data that shift rate-hike expectations -- can give bank stocks a quick boost or cut them off. If you're holding financial stocks or ETFs heading into the Fed policy meeting on Sept. 20-21, consider this risk-limiting earnings options strategy.Superregional bank SunTrust Banks (STI), meanwhile, has flirted with a 44.29 buy point over the past week or so, and ended Friday trades down 1.1% to 43.39. Great Western Bancorp (GWB), meanwhile, faded from a 35.01 entry by dropping 0.7% to 32.03, but was still trading within a flat base pattern.Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were not within buy range.

54,STI,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have rallied over the past week as Federal Reserve officials expressed more openness to an interest-rate hike, but are any of them buys right now? Just one.JPMorgan erased intraday losses to closed uncahnged at 67.50 on the stock market today, still in range after clearing a 66.58 buy point on Monday from handle in a consolidation. Volume on the breakout was barely average, not a great sign. A stock is considered within buying range if it is 5% or less above a buy point.Super regional SunTrust Banks (STI) and Great Western Bancorp (GWB), meanwhile, are basing and are near buy points.SunTrust rallied to close up 0.2% to 44.07 Wednesday, just below a 44.29 entry area. Great Western finished 0.3% higher at 34.24 as it makes its way through a flat base with a 35.11 entry.TD (TD), meanwhile, was carving its way through a flat base with a 45.84 buy point. TD fell 0.5% to 44.60 Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Bank earnings are long gone, but Fed news -- and key economic data that shift rate hike expectations -- can give bank stocks a quick boost or cut them off.

55,STI,"Stocks eased at the open Wednesday, but top new growth stock Veeva Systems (VEEV) burst into new high ground following Wall Street-beating Q2 results reported late Tuesday. Bank stocks also rallied.The supplier of business software to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry jumped more than 10% to 41.57, striking new highs in the process after Tuesday's 3% drop. During that session, the stock received vital support at the key 10-week moving average.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%. The big-cap and megacap gauge looks poised to end slightly down for the month of August, where it started at 18,432.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 also fell less than 0.2% following a lower-than-expected reading on the Chicago PMI survey, which at 51.5 for August still showed that business is expanding in the Chicago area. Econoday had expected a 55.2 reading.Veeva, which joined IBD Leaderboard as a top-flight growth stock on June 20 near 34, has now rallied nearly 50% since initially breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle base at 28.05. Many of the biggest stock market winners built this pattern en route to outstanding gains. Veeva's profit in the July-ended second quarter lifted 15% to 15 cents a share, smashing Wall Street's view for zero growth.While the 15% jump in earnings per share was the smallest increase since early 2014, Veeva has now averaged 47% EPS growth over the past six quarters. The company, which went public in October 2013, reflects how newer companies tend to take over as new market winners.An intrepid investor could have bought a small position when the stock pulled back to or near its 10-week moving average both in late June (near 31.42) and on Tuesday ahead of results (near 38.09).IBD's TAKE: To find great stocks, first size up their strength in terms of profits, sales, margins, return on equity, relative stock strength, relative group strength, level of fund sponsorship and solid chart action that shows huge demand vs. available supply. A great place to begin your growth stock research is by using IBD Stock Checkup, found in the Research section at Investors.com.Elsewhere in the stock market today, banks continued to rise amid growing anticipation that the Federal Reserve will follow through on its pledge to raise interest rates. Goldman Sachs (GS) bobbed above and below the break-even line in twice its usual volume. The investment banking titan is gunning for a fifth up day in a row. The stock has been showing bullish action lately by lifting above its long-term 200-day moving average, which is still falling. Deutsche Bank (DB) jumped more than 3% to 14.91, poised to make its highest close since late June.Healthy stocks tend to trade above the midterm 50-day moving average, which in turn is rising above the slower-moving 200-day line. So in Goldman's case, the stock needs more work building the upside of a base before a potential breakout could occur. Same goes for Apple (AAPL), which is pulling back in recent weeks following a nice upward thrust back above its 200-day moving average. Apple's rebound gained thrust with a July 27 gap up in price following slightly better than expected fiscal Q3 earnings results.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, super regional banks have been stars the past five days, up more than 4% as a group. Top stocks in that group include Great Western Bancorp (GWB) and SunTrust (STI), both of which are forming bases.
"
56,STI,"The stock market padded Tuesday's strong gains with a healthy advance by midday Wednesday. Large caps moved ahead of small caps.Meanwhile, Atlanta-based regional banking leader SunTrust Banks (STI) continued to act well after breaking out of a nearly six-month cup-with-handle pattern with a 43.13 buy point. The stock gained 2% to 44.01, up 2% past the proper entry.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 0.9% each after advancing 2% and 1.4%, respectively, on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was also up 0.9%. Utilities continued to sink after having a white-hot first quarter. The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.7%. The small-cap S&P 600 added 0.6%. Volume was tracking lower on the Nasdaq from the previous session, but it was higher on the NYSE.The super regional bank and money center bank industry subgroups held a spot among the top 15 advancers among IBD's 197 industry groups in the stock market today, each rising more than 2% so far. The growing prospect of another rate hike at either the June or July Federal Reserve meetings has apparently attracted more institutional buying in lenders. Higher short-term interest rates will enable banks to charge more for loans, improving profit margins.SunTrust suffered mightily in the wake of the subprime debt crash, as the bank suffered net losses in both 2009 and 2010, but earnings have since gotten back on track. Wall Street sees EPS rising in the low- to mid-single digits both this year and next. Pretax margin has risen sharply over the past five years, from 0.2% in 2010 to 31.5% last year. It has total assets of $194 billion as of March this year. Non-performing loans represented just 0.7% of total loans outstanding. A quarter-to-quarter increase of $303 million in such loans was due mainly to Wall Street downgrades of energy-related debt.SunTrust gets an 82 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Just two other companies in its Banks-Super Regional subgroup get a higher EPS Rating: Great Western Bancorp (GWB) (92) and Regions Financial (RF) of Birmingham, Ala. (86).The 5% buy zone in SunTrust extends up to 45.29.Which commercial and real estate-focused bank joined IBD Leaderboard as a premium growth play that just also broke out? See it here.Elsewhere in the market Wednesday, various oil-related stocks advanced, as West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures headed toward the $50-a-barrel level.Drilling, field services and oil machinery subgroups paced the upside with gains of 2.7% to 3.3%. The field services is ranked highest among the three at 100th among 197 IBD groups and subgroups, as seen in IBD's daily rankings. In the group, 800-pound industry gorilla Halliburton (HAL) (EPS 8, Relative Strength Rating 84) gained more than 2.5% in light trade to 42.53 and was looking to clear a 42.92 handle buy point in a very deep, cup-style bottoming base.Oil States (OIS), Superior Energy Services (SPN), Archrock Partners (APLP), RPC Inc. (RES) and USA Compression (USAC) are the only other Halliburton group peers that hold an RS Rating of 80 or higher and trade at least 10 a share.
"
57,STI,"Stocks fell sharply in the first 45 minutes of trading Friday, as investors frowned upon the huge miss in May U.S. payrolls, up a mere 38,000 vs. the consensus forecast for 158,000 net new jobs. Banks led the sell-off, but utility stocks rallied.The Nasdaq composite sank more than 1.1%; the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell 0.7% to 0.8%. Dow industrials component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dropped more than 3%, and fellow Dow member Goldman Sachs (GS) lost almost 3%. The former has been working on the right side of a new base since mid-February; the latter is still nearly 30% below a 52-week high of 218.77.The Dow utility average rebounded 1.3% and looked poised to register a second straight weekly gain.Also bucking the decline were chipmakers. The Philly SOX index gained more than 0.2% early before giving back virtually all of that advance on the back of strong quarterly results from large-cap play Broadcom (AVGO).The leading chipmaker and chip design firm for various markets gapped up at the open and gushed 5% higher to 162.89, moving past a 159.75 base-on-base buy point. The stock has made an excellent run since clearing a first-stage base at 39.84 in September 2013. Yet Friday's breakout was from a first-stage base. In August 2015, Broadcom undercut the low of a prior cup base that formed from late March to late May of the same year. That correction reset Broadcom's base count.Broadcom posted a 26% gain in earnings to $2.69 a share in the April-ended fiscal second quarter, beating Wall Street's view by 13%. Revenue leapt 119% to $3.54 billion, reflecting the merger between Broadcom and Avago Technologies. The huge top-line increase stopped a four-quarter streak of decelerating sales growth from 131% (Q1 of FY 2015) to 8% (Q1 of the current fiscal year).Fresh economic data that followed the weak jobs report on Friday appeared to confirm the slow pace of economic growth, with the ISM services index coming in at 52.9 for May, below Econoday's forecast of 55.5. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. April factory orders rose 1.9%, just missing the 2.0% growth view.Separately, the Markit PMI survey declined to 51.3 in May vs. 52.8 in April. A strike among Verizon (VZ) workers likely contributed to the small increase in May U.S. payrolls.A few leading stocks are trying to keep their breakouts intact. Fast-growing retail chain Five Below (FIVE) rose 1% to 43.32. It's just below a 43.52 base-on-base entry.SunTrust Banks (STI) slid 4% to 42.35, 1% below a 43.13 cup-with-handle buy point. Volume was running sharply above normal pace for both stocks.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, WebMD (WBMD) was one of the hardest hit, falling more than 2% to 64.20. The health information website, ranked No. 6 in the current list, closed a $360 million convertible debt offering earlier this week, which ultimately could dilute the company's share count. WebMD still has a relatively small supply of stock, with 39 million shares outstanding and a float of 35 million.The stock has made a strong run since breaking out of a cup-with-handle pattern at 46.01 in early December.As seen in Thursday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

59,STI,"Mkts went into reverse yesterday.....as earnings seasons moves on and investors/traders struggle with how overvalued/overbought the mkt is based on broader macro economic conditions and very mixed earnings reports - ...the dollar ended the day higher sending oil and other commodities lower as investors reconsider the prospect of higher rates here in the US when the FED meets next week. Once again - many are left asking - Could the FED surprise the mkts and hike in April? Let me be clear - in the words of Luis Enrique - ""Yo no se manana..."" (I don't know about tomorrow)...but I do know that today - the answer to that question is NO WAY!Once again - you got some of the talking heads suggesting that the US economy is so strong that rates need to rise sooner rather than later - the most recent Hawk is Eric Rosengren - Boston's Fed President as he re-iterated 'his' opinion on Monday that the FED'was closer to raising rates than many investors anticipate.... and that the mkt may be underestimating the FED's pace of tightening'Ok sports fans - here we go again.....all the talk of the next FED move just days ahead of their meeting and the end of the month..... Now while I believe that we won't get a move in April - I do expect the FED to leave the door wide open for the June hike (as expected). To add fuel to that fire we heard from Peter Gorra - head of FX trading at BNP Paribas......(Forex - FX - trading is defined as the global decentralized mkt for the trading of currencies - buying, selling and exchanging them at current prices). Currencies are very sensitive to any move in rates so - Peter does sit at the center of speculation.....and he thinks that""U.S. data has actually been pretty good, and there is very little chance of a June move by the Fed priced in,""Ok - first - US data has been pretty good? Really? Let me count thy ways:Yesterday's Philly Fed report - big disappointment, Earlier in this month alone we learned that ISM NY - disappointed, Empire State Manf - disappointed, labor mkt conditions - disappointed, Factory orders - disappointed, Factory orders ex Transports - disappointed, Durable Goods - disappointed, Durables Ex transports -disappointed, Wholesale inventories - disappointed, Wholesale trade - disappointed, Retail Sales - a big disappointment, PPI - oh right - negative, PPI ex food and energy - negative, Construction Spending - negative, Industrial production - another negative.....but so much for the negatives...lets accentuate the positives shall we?Non Farm payrolls - met expectations in terms of 'jobs created' - never mind that they are low wage, temporary (let's ignore that fact), and forget the fact that layoffs hit a 6 month high in January with daily headlines of more 'restructurings' (layoffs) as we move thru earnings season.... US Markit ISM met expectations (positive), ISM Manf -beat, ISM Prices Paid - beat, Oh and the Univ of Mich sentiment survey was 'better than expected', and Earnings reports - yeah - they are missing top line organic growth, yet still beating embarrassingly low earnings estimates - but hey - a beat is a beat and that is positive...so maybe Pete is on the right track.....But as far as the mkt NOT pricing in a June hike - I would disagree - the FED has been quite clear on that point...she has left the June door wide open - if investors have not heard that call of the wild - then they are living under a rock.....Now the real question is not if they have heard the call - the question is Do they believe the call? And that is up for discussion - because here is where I do agree with Peter.....if investors do not believe her and ignore the calls for higher rates and then she in fact moves on rates - then he is right - investors will scream - what the ...?Given Yellen's clear dovish stance, the mkts are not looking for any rate hike this month at all, but we are seeing a small pullback - which reflects just a bit of 'uncertainty' as some investors/traders recede to the sidelines.....but then I expect that next week we will get the usual ramp up when it is clear that rates will go nowhere. Look - the Fed is worried about the both the US and the global economies and feels a bit trapped...... So - next week expect more 'nothing done'.Yesterday's ECB press conference doesn't help.....He (Mario Draghi) did nothing in terms of another policy move but did leave the door open to further negative interest-rate cuts....oh...and that is another sure sign of 'strength'! This morning we wake up to the latest Japanese headline - Hold on this one is good.....""BoJ Officials Are Said to Eye Possible Negative Rates on Loans"" - Yes - you read that correctly.....the headline suggests that the BoJ may consider offering NEGATIVE rates on some loans (in addition the negative rates on deposits) in order to stimulate their economy....... So the bank will pay YOU to borrow money to invest......Does the word 'desperation' come to mind at all?This morning US futures are once again hovering around the unchanged line...initially lower by 3 pts in early trading - but have now recovered a bit and are slightly positive at 7 am. There are no economic reports today to speak of , but we will get another slew of earnings....Caterpillar (CAT)and McDonald's (MCD) will hit the tape prior to the opening while Alcoa (AA), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), Sun Trust (STI) report post close. Traders will now get a chance to react to last nights announcements from Alphabet (GOOGL) and General Electric (GE)...Alphabet missed on both the top and the bottom line (that was surprising) - the stock sold off 5% in the moments after the announcement and are trading at $722/sh right now.GE on the other hand beat the estimates but is also seeing some profit taking in their stock in early morning trading. Trading at $30.65 down 0.30 cts.As we approach the end of April you would expect to see is a narrowing of market breadth and this is exactly what we are currently seeing. The S&P is testing the November 2015 highs (just over 2100) and hitting a wall......Relative Strength (RSI) which began to roll over in March is suggesting market breadth is narrowing or that fewer and fewer stocks are holding up the indexes as money moves into the largest blue chip companies (think safety) typical of what you would see ahead of an expected correction.Now that being said - there are so many other things to consider......The Fed and the fact that we are in a Presidential election year.....and we are in the 8th year of the current presidency... and historically, the mkts tend to peak in April and then suffer for the rest of the year.Since 1900, the S&P has on average, fallen by 1.2% in the 8th year of a presidential term, with the market rising only 44 percent of the time. This summer will be very interesting.....History shows us (82% if the time) that if stocks rise between July 31 and October 31, then we can expect the incumbent party to win in November (Think Hillary).....BUT If stocks fall, (86% of the time) then the thinking is that a new party will take over. (Think Trump) ....so will history repeat itself or not?I expect the mkt to continue to churn and challenge resistance right here at 2100........I do not expect any major move in either direction until next week's FED announcement. Remember - it is also month end - so expect some window dressing as we move thru next week.

72,STI,"Bank stocks have been rallying amid an improving economy and the expectation of higher interest rates, but will the rally continue when second-quarter results start filtering in during July?Financial services specialist Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expects a ""challenging"" second quarter for the big money-center banks amid margin pressures and lower-than-expected trading revenue.As for large regional banks: KBW notes that Wall Street analysts expect residential-mortgage and credit-card balances to rebound in the second quarter, helping to drive commercial and consumer loan growth.Still, KBW analysts expect continued net interest margin compression in the sector.In its second-quarter preview of bank stocks, Deutsche Bank research analysts see ""less upside in the near term,"" given that the big money-center bank stocks have ""rallied nicely"" since last July.So what are their top bank-stock picks?Deutsche Bank's top names among the biggest bank stocks are JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).The former's net interest margin ""may positively surprise,"" Deutsche Bank said, and JPMorgan Chase might also have lower expenses and a decent return on capital.Cost cuts will also likely impact Bank of America positively, the analysts noted. Their ""buy"" rating also reflects ""large leverage to higher interest rates"" and reduced concerns over capital levels.Among the large regional banks, both Deutsche Bank and KBW give high ratings to Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI) as it continues to better manage expenses and its balance sheet.KBW cites SunTrust, Northern Trust (NTRS) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) as the three big regional banks likely to beat Wall Street earnings estimates in Q2.IBD also rates Northern Trust highly, with a Composite Rating of 87 out of a possible 99. Zions has an 80 score, SunTrust a 78 and JPMorgan a 75.Deutsche Bank also has a buy rating on Buffalo, NY-based M&T Bank (MTB) ahead of a long-awaited deal to acquire Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK), which it expects to occur later this year.

The bank put Q4 average total loans at $47.4 billion, up 7% from a year earlier.Q4 deposits rose 9% to $57.8 billion.Share repurchases during the quarter helped the bottom line.""While we continue to manage headwinds, including the low-rate environment as well as rising technology and regulatory expenses, we remain focused on the long term,"" CEO Ralph Babb said.Comerica stock was down about 0.4% to 40.81 by late afternoon but was as high as 44.80 earlier in the stock market today, Friday. The stock has spent the past 12 days below its 50-day moving average, amid broader trading volatility.However, the plummeting oil prices that have compounded that volatility have not hurt Comerica, Babb says.""Given that the significant decline in oil and gas prices has only materialized in the past couple of months and our customers are generally well hedged, we have not yet seen adverse trends in the portfolio,"" he said. ""We continue to closely monitor the total portfolio, as well as the energy sector and any residual impacts on the Texas economy.""For 2015, the company guided for loan growth roughly equal to last year's, ""relatively stable"" net interest and noninterest income, a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expenses due to an increase in regulatory, technology and pension costs.Pittsburgh-based PNC, the nation's second biggest regional bank, said that its Q4 EPS fell 3 cents to $1.84. Revenue was down fractionally to around $4 billion, edging views.But commercial loans continued to rise, jumping nearly 10% to $128.4 billion during the quarter. And the money reserved for credit losses fell by 54% from last year to $52 million as credit quality remained stable.The bank's net interest margin fell to 2.89%, down from 3.38% in Q4 2013, partly reflecting lower loan yields.Loans grew by 5% or $9 billion from Q4 last year to $205 billion. Credit quality remained stable, PNC said. Deposits also grew 5%, to $232 billion.Shares of PNC were trading up 1.2% to 83.47 by late afternoon Friday after a five-day streak of declines.""We added customers, grew loans and deposits, increased fee income and capital, and reduced expenses,"" CEO William Demchak said. ""While the near-term revenue environment remains challenging, I like how we are positioned heading into 2015.""Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks reported fourth-quarter EPS that fell 5 cents from the year-earlier period to 72 cents, missing views for 80 cents. Revenue inched down from a year ago to $2.043 billion, just below views for $2.045 billion. But revenue was up from the third quarter, led by mortgages and investment banking, the company said.And SunTrust was able to grow average performing loans by 6% during the year to $132.7 billion. Deposits grew 7% by Dec. 31 to $136.9 billion.""Our strong performance in the fourth quarter and 2014 was driven by good loan and deposit growth, continued expense discipline and improved credit quality,"" CEO William H. Rogers said.The bank's net interest margin fell to 2.96% during the quarter from 3.20% in 2013.SunTrust shares jumped 3.4% to 37.94 by late afternoon Friday.

It sees upward earnings revisions as the main drivers of stock performance next year.As for large regional banks, KBW likes names that can grow net interest income regardless of the Fed's action on interest rates. It cites two in particular — Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), based in Columbus, Ohio; and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI).In the small to midcap group, it'll come down to the ""direction of estimates,"" KBW said. Despite its so-so view on the group itself, KBW has several ""favorite plays"" for 2015.They include Signature Bank (SBNY), Private Bancorp (PVTB), Eagle Bancorp (EGBN), Talmer Bancorp (TLMR), First Merchants Corp.

168,STI,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been embroiled in one scandal after another for more than one and a half years. Troubles have been mounting at Wells Fargo since the revelation of the sales scandal, which was followed by disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business, online bill pay services and the Wealth and Investment Management segment. With the ongoing review process of business practices, more wrongdoings may be reported, consequently straining the top line.The mortgage business of Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed a slowdown in the second quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues will likely have remained low.However, management expects residential mortgage originations to increase in the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q2 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are likely to have improved slightly on a sequential basis during the April-June quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized in the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of collection and funding activities, the bank is positioned to start increasing originations over time, and currently estimates the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.Notably, based on the current pricing trends, management expects production margin to have declined further in second-quarter 2018.Net Interest Income (NII) Growth: NII growth is expected to have been decent, given modest loan and deposit growth, and rising net interest margin on rising rates.According to management, net interest income is predicted to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. It expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might have recorded escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings, during the quarter under review. Moreover, ongoing litigation hassles are expected to have resulted in elevated legal costs. Encouragingly, seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected to have dropped in the quarter, though salary expense is likely to have flared up.Non-Interest Revenues to Disappoint: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely have been recorded on market declines. Growth in trading revenues is predicted to have been muted as uncertainties, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions were not enough to induce volatility. In addition, trust income is likely to disappoint on lower equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP,and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.33%.

169,STI,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, driven by consumer banking business and higher equity markets, volatility-driven trading revenues are expected to have remained flat year over year in the second quarter. Though the April-June quarter witnessed uncertainty, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it was insufficient to aid strong trading.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, ""From a trading revenue point of view, at the end of the first quarter, what we've indicated was that we would expect a normal seasonal slowdown in the second quarter. I'd say that, that is exactly what we're seeing right now in the results. That should mean then that we'll basically have flattish trading revenues.""Notably, the equities business is expected to have remained strong in the quarter to be reported, whereas the fixed income business might have experienced a disappointing performance. Further, benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to have offset the negatives.Other Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia in 2018. In U.S.-branded cards, excluding Hilton, continued underlying revenue growth is anticipated as loan balances are maturing as estimated. However, this would be mostly offset by the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect this January. Moreover, the Hilton portfolio sale will likely have a year-over-year impact.Rising card revenues are expected to accelerate growth of overall Latin America Consumer revenues in 2018. Therefore, the to-be-reported quarter results are expected to reflect the trend.Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: Investment banking performance is anticipated to have been flat in the second quarter. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter.Management expects market revenues to go along the overall operating environment. Nevertheless, a seasonal decline in trading revenues is predicted from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues will likely have improved quarter over quarter, assuming favorable market conditions, and continued revenue growth in accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services is anticipated on completion of targets across the global network.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. Nonetheless, some legal settlements during the quarter might have impacted Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might have perked up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to have risen, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG. Net credit-card losses are likely to have worsened. Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points (bps) for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term. In retail services, NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -1.7%.

170,STI,"After an impressive first-quarter performance driven by significant volatility, client activity has returned to normalized levels. So, this will likely result in relatively stable trading revenues for JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) in second-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute roughly one-fifth of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lend support to its results scheduled to be announced on Jul 13.Unlike the first quarter when higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, impending U.S.-China trade war and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility, developments like further escalation in the trade war and some other geo-political tensions in the second quarter were not enough to lead to substantial rise in client activity.Further, at an investors’ conference in May, JPMorgan’s head of Corporate and Investment Banking division, Daniel Pinto projected flat year-over-year markets revenues in the second quarter.Nonetheless, similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.75 billion reflects an increase of 10% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, per the consensus estimate, fixed income trading revenues will remain flat year over year at $3.22 billion.Apart from this, here are some of the other factors that are anticipated to influence JPMorgan’s second-quarter results:Steady rise in net interest income: A modest improvement in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — will likely lead to an increase in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support despite flattening of the yield curve in the second quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $2.21 trillion for the second quarter indicates an increase of 1.7% year over year. This along with decent lending activities is projected to boost the company’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.Subdued investment banking performance: Equity issuances across the globe seem to have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, JPMorgan is expected to record a slight increase in equity underwriting fees in the second quarter.Also, increasing global M&A activities will likely support the company’s advisory fees to some extent. Further, as JPMorgan remains at the top position when it comes to garnering global investment banking fees, this will likely provide the bank a leverage to attract more business.However, rise in rates is likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuance activities. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues to some extent.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter. As JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, as JPMorgan is aiming to enter newer markets by opening branches, expenses are likely to remain on the higher side. Further, increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings will result in a rise in costs.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:The chances of JPMorgan beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high this time as it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is +1.19%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.JPMorgan Chase & Co.

171,STI,"The earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks have performed in the second quarter amid uncertainty related to the trade war fears.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, major bank stocks’ performance lost some steam. The primary reason is the flattening of the yield curve. As such, net interest margin (one of the key metrics for gauging banks’ profitability) is expected to be subdued in the second quarter.Also, growth in trading revenues, which was one of the main supporting factors during the first quarter, is likely to be muted. Though the second quarter witnessed uncertainty mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it wasn’t sufficient.Further, investment banking performance is anticipated to be flat. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities.Dismal mortgage banking performance is also expected to continue in the second quarter amid rising interest rates as mortgage originations and volume declined.Nevertheless, a decent improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer will offer support banks’ interest income while weakness in revolving home equity loans is expected to persist.Further, asset quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings and initiatives to expand into newer areas are expected to result in a slight rise in expenses. But, increase in overall non-operating expenses is likely to be manageable.Further, passage of the new law to lessen banks’ regulatory burden and lower tax rates will support bottom-line growth.Hence, major banks on the S&P 500 Index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness 8.2% year-over-year earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Yet, this compares unfavorably with 25.4% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Picking the Potential WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

172,STI,"The Fed will be announcing the results of bank stress tests on Jun 21 and results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review (""CCAR"") on Jun 28. The tests, which are an annual affair and a must for banks since the 2008 financial meltdown, are designed to ensure that they are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn. Looking back, President Donald Trump in May signed the biggest rollback of bank regulations since the global economic downturn into law.The law has been designed to relax rules for all but the largest banks. The move is likely to significantly benefit community banks. And apart from suburban and rural banks, the new law is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. Bank stocks have been performing well ever since Trump came to power and with Fed having already made two rate hikes this year, banks are likely to finally get benefited.New Stress Test to Benefit BanksStress tests have been in place since 2008 and are considered one of the most important measures to assess the ability of banks to withstand an economic crisis. However, in May, Trump signed the biggest rollback of financial regulations since the Dodd-Frank Act came to effect in 2010. The new law has raised the assets threshold for banks that are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.This certainly has freed small banks from the burden of being considered too big to fail. Thus the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer need to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. Moreover, the new law cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks.The largest banks on the other hand will have to pass a stricter stress test. However, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests.Moreover, six foreign banks, namely Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), BNP Paribas SA (BNPQY  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report), Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG, have been included this year for the first time that will have to undergo the stress test.Banks to Pay Record DividendsDespite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks are expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders in the United States are estimated to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, almost 25% more than last year.Among these, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report) are leading the race. Per a Bloomberg report, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America is expected to pay out more than 100% of their profits over the next four quarters. These banks are likely to be followed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). JP Morgan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.This implies that the largest commercial banks are most likely to pass the Fed’s stress test. Moreover, the Fed too thinks that the banking sector has successfully entered the next stage of its recovery since the financial crisis. Moreover, the Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year, which has resulted banks in charging their customers more, thus making their financial position even better.Summing UpThe new law certainly has made things easier for small commercial banks. On the other hand, the large banks are likely to announce record payouts to their shareholders for the first time since the economic crisis, which proves that they are in a position to comfortably pass the stress test.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

173,STI,"Late on May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill loosening Obama-era regulations on the banking industry. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act not only eases rules for banks, it sets the stage for further deregulation by multiple agencies. President Trump is widely expected to sign the bill into law before Memorial Day. According to House Speaker Paul Ryan, the new bill is likely to significantly benefit community banks. However, apart from suburban and rural banks, the bill is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. With additional rate hikes also around the corner, investing in select bank stocks looks like a smart option.   House Approves Bill Easing Bank RulesOn Tuesday, the House voted 258 to 159 to approve the bipartisan Senate-drafted legislation which significantly deregulates the banking industry. The bill raised the assets threshold for banks which are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.As a result, the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer have to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. These plans outline how a bank proposes to be wound up in case it faces bankruptcy.The bill also cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks. New measures have been introduced for those taking student loans. Additionally, credit reporting agencies will now be required to offer credit monitoring services at no charge. Further Deregulation on the AnvilThe new legislation also gives regulators greater discretion to decide at what point banks holding $100 billion to $250 billion in assets would have to undergo stress tests for capital adequacy. Such a need would, of course, only arise in case another financial crisis takes place.This doesn’t exclude the largest banks from stress tests altogether. But, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests. These tests are collectively termed Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR.Further, multiple agencies, including the SEC and the Fed, have powers to amend the manner in which the Volcker Rule is implemented. Congressional approval would not be required in such an event. For instance, regulators plan to remove an assumption that defines positions held by banks for a period led than 60 days as speculative. Our ChoicesIn keeping with Trump’s electoral promises, the new bill passed by the House has greatly eased banking regulations. Further, it has set the stage for further deregulation which will likely be undertaken by multiple financial agencies.Investing in banking stocks looks like a smart option at this point. This is particularly true since rates are likely to trend higher. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in.

174,STI,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, this compared favorably with adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Improvement in both net interest income and fee income drove results. Further, a decline in provision for credit losses and improving loans acted as tailwinds. However, an increase in expenses was on the downside.Net income from continuing operations was $402 million, up from $296 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 3.1% year over year to $1.55 billion. However, the figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income went up 2.5% year over year to $952 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from low deposit betas and elevated interest rates. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations improved 2 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.15%.Non-interest income was $601 million, reflecting an increase of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by an improvement in all components except trust and investment services income, cards and payments income along with other income.Non-interest expenses (excluding notable items) increased 7.9% year over year to $1.01 billion. The rise was due to higher personnel costs, largely due to recent acquisitions as well as accelerated technology investments and higher performance-based compensation.Strong Balance SheetAt the end of the first quarter, average total deposits were $102.56 billion, down 1.2% from the prior quarter. Average total loans were $86.93 billion, up 1.1% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 2 bps year over year to 0.25%. Provision for credit losses declined 3.2% year over year to $61 million.Further, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.65%, down 7 bps year over year.However, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $881 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year quarter.Capital PositionKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.22% as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 8.51% as of Mar 31, 2017. However, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.84%, up from 10.74% as of Mar 31, 2017.The company’s estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.88% at the end of the quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $199 million worth of shares as part of its 2017 capital plan.Our TakeKeyCorp remains well positioned for growth in revenues, given rising rate environment and rise in loan and deposit balances. Improving credit quality and enhanced capital deployment activities are the other positives. Further, the corporate tax rate cut will aid profitability to some extent. However, persistently increasing expenses, owing to investments in franchise and acquisitions, are likely to hurt bottom-line growth. Further, the company's significant exposure toward risky loan portfolios remains a major concern.KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Net interest income growth, higher card income and impressive equity trading income supported revenues. Operating expenses recorded a decline. Additionally, provision for credit losses remained stable.Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 in first-quarter 2018, up from the prior-year quarter adjusted figure of $1.02 on high interest income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.49. Higher revenues and improved credit metrics were recorded. Moreover, rise in loans was another tailwind. Nonetheless, lower deposits and rise in expenses were undermining factors.SunTrust Banks, Inc.

175,STI,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.10 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Also, the figure reflects an improvement of 32.5% from the prior-year quarter.Shares of the company have gained more than 3% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with growth in its net interest revenues as well as fee revenues. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter was $1.14 billion, up from $880 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter increased 9.9% year over year to $4.19 billion. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.05 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $925 million, up 15% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and deposits, partly offset by rise in average long-term debt.Also, net interest margin increased 9 basis points year over year to 1.23%.Total fee and other revenues increased 8.3% from the prior-year quarter to $3.27 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees, investment management and performance fees, foreign exchange and other trading revenues, and investment and other income.Total non-interest expenses were $2.74 billion, increasing 3.7% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except professional, legal and other purchased services costs, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up nearly 8% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound), partly offset by the sale of CenterSquare Investment Management and some other changes.Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.5 trillion were up 9% year over year. Higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $85 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end. Also, allowance for loan losses decreased 4.9% year over year to $156 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $5 million, unchanged year over year.Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, common equity Tier 1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) was 11.7% compared with 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2017.

176,STI,"The long-time demand of banks to scale back stringent regulations is finally a reality. The House passed a crucial bill easing some provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that were put in place as safeguard against repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.The House passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 258 to 159, promising it to be beneficial for small and mid-sized banks. It would now be presented to President Donald Trump for signing, with the Senate already having passed the legislation in March.Highlights of the BillPerhaps the most significant relief from the bill is the reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill will eventually raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.Banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later. This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 38.Therefore, banks including SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief. These banks will not be required to undergo annual stress tests or submit so-called ‘living wills,’ both necessitated as measures to plan for financial disaster. So, this will eventually lower regulatory compliance costs.Further, the move will likely lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Other than this, the bill will lower the amount of capital required to be held by the custodian banks. The bill will allow these companies to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately send it to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) custodian banks — State Street (STT  -  Free Report), BNY Mellon and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) — will be the major gainers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempted from complying with the Volker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading. The bill also eases mortgage loan data reporting requirements for several banks and credit unions as well as relaxes rules on what type of real estate loans smaller community banks can make.Additionally, the legislation will add new safeguards for student loan borrowers and necessitate credit reporting companies like Equifax and TransUnion to provide free credit monitoring services.Is Dodd-Frank Hurting Banks’ Financials?The Dodd-Frank Act has been criticized by small and medium banks for tougher rules that have made it difficult of them to do business and remain profitable. But in reality, did the law actually hurt their profitability?Well, if we go by the figures, banks have continued to earn significant profits. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported record earnings of $56 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 27.5% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6.1 billion, 17.7% above the prior-year quarter level.While one can say that improving economy and higher interest rates have supported banks, strict rules have also played their part to some extent in aiding the financials.Monitoring by regulatory bodies has helped banks to keep a check on their operations and maintain sufficient capital cushion to avoid another financial crisis. By establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to oversee credit cards, mortgages and other financial products as well as other regulatory bodies to check for signs of instability, the Dodd-Frank Act provided stability to the banking industry.Road AheadThe bill is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations. Still, it is the most important step to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth (as seen by many) and lending activities.But the legislation is of little help to some of the nation’s biggest banks (in term of assets) like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), PNC Financial, Goldman and Wells Fargo. Notably, further discussions seem to be going on about lowering capital requirements and easing other restrictions on these banks.Later this month, the banking regulators are expected to release a proposal to weaken the Volker Rule for big banks. Further, the CFPB interim head has significantly scaled back the agency’s activities and stopped probes into finance companies.Thus, in the coming days, more regulatory easing is expected. These will definitely help the banks to further improve profitability. Also, shareholders might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

177,STI,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is STI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.SunTrust Beats on Q1 Earnings as Expenses DeclineSunTrust’s first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.29 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Also, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 91 cents.Results were primarily driven by rise in net interest income, lower expenses as well as lower provisions. Also, an improvement in overall asset quality was a tailwind. However, decline in non-interest income hurt results to some extent.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $612 million, up 36% from the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Increases, Costs DeclineTotal revenues (taxable equivalent basis) for the quarter were $2.26 billion, almost stable year over year. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 4% year over year to $1.46 billion.On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin was up 15 basis points (bps) to 3.24%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields, lower premium amortization expenses and positive mix shift in the loan portfolio.Non-interest income was $796 million, down 6% from the prior-year quarter. The decline was due to a fall in capital markets-related income, mortgage-related income as well as client transaction-related fees.Non-interest expenses declined 3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.42 billion, largely due to lower operating losses and other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $778 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down 9% from the prior-year-quarter end. Non-performing loans fell 5 bps year over year to 0.50% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 10 bps year over year to 0.22% of total average loans held for investment. Also, provision for credit losses plunged 76% from the year-ago quarter to $28 million.Strong Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, SunTrust had total assets of $204.9 billion while shareholders’ equity was $24.3 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Mar 31, 2018, loans held for investments were $142.6 billion, down marginally from the prior-quarter end. Total consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% from the prior quarter to $161.4 billion.SunTrust’s estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was 9.85% as of Mar 31, 2018.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, the company bought back shares worth $330 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and Consensus  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and Consensus | SunTrust Banks, Inc.

178,STI,"Major banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results over the last five trading days managed to record bottom-line improvement, driven by rising rates, stable asset quality and lower taxes. Apart from the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results reflected a slight improvement in lending activities.However, higher expenses and slowdown in mortgage banking business continued to be major headwinds. Also, it seems that the guidance provided by management didn’t meet investors expectations. Thus, the performance of banks over the last five trading sessions was bearish.Apart from first-quarter earnings releases, a huge penalty for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines. The bank’s business misconducts have even led to several probes into its business activities.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 20, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. SunTrust’s (STI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.29 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Results were primarily driven by rise in net interest income, lower expenses as well as lower provisions. However, decline in non-interest income hurt results to some extent.

Riding on high revenues, Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) recorded an impressive earnings surprise of 12.9% in first-quarter 2018. Reported earnings of 35 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Easing margin pressure and higher revenues benefited the results. However, lower loans and deposits balance as well as higher expenses were the undermining factors. (Read more: Regions Financial's Q1 Earnings Beat, Costs Escalate)3. Fifth Third Bancorp’s (FITB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.

Capital One’s (COF  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34. Results benefited from rise in revenues, a decline in provision for credit losses and easing margin pressure. Yet, an increase in expenses was the undermining factor. (Read More: Capital One Beats on Q1 Earnings as Revenues Improve)5. Business misconducts continue to haunt Wells Fargo. The bank has been penalized for alleged customer abuses at its mortgage and auto lending businesses. The company agreed to pay $1 billion (in total) to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Both the regulators fined Wells Fargo for wrongly charging fees to borrowers who wanted to lock in an interest rate on a pending mortgage loan and for sticking auto loan clients with insurance policies they didn't want or require. Notably, the company admitted that tens of thousands of its customers who could not afford the combined auto loan and extra insurance payment fell behind on their payments and had their cars repossessed.Nevertheless, these allegations are separate from the bank’s sales practice scandal that erupted in September 2016.As a result of this huge fine, Wells Fargo adjusted its first-quarter 2018 earnings by an additional $800 million accrual. This lowered the company’s first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per to $4.7 billion or 96 cents per share.Nevertheless, this isn’t the end of litigations/probes for Wells Fargo. The company’s wealth management business, currency trading operation and retirement-plan services unit are reportedly under investigation by several regulators.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week6 monthsJPM-1.2%9.3%BAC-0.6%9.3%WFC-0.2%-4.5%C-1.2%-5.5%COF-6.5%0.0%USB0.7%-5.4%PNC1.1%6.8%In the last five trading sessions, PNC Financial was the major gainer, with its shares gaining 1.1%.

179,STI,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from improvement in revenues, stable adjusted expenses and lower provisions. However, a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor.SunTrust has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one, over the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.1%.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteHowever, the company’s activities in the first quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.11 remained unchanged over the last seveb days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 27.6%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.27 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects an improvement of 2.8% from the prior-year quarter.However, the company’s price performance has not been very impressive. Its shares have lost 3.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.9%.Will the price performance improve post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s check which factors are expected to impact SunTrust’s Q1 earnings.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings assets of $184.6 billion for the first quarter reflects an improvement of nearly 1% year over year. Moreover, the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, to which the company has a high degree of exposure. Thus, given the loan growth and rising interest rates, NII is expected to improve in the quarter.Also, management expects first-quarter net interest margin to be up 0-2 basis points (bps).Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: While overall mortgage servicing fees remained decent in the first quarter, production volumes slowed down. Thus, mortgage production income is expected to remain weak. Moreover, with the refinance boom nearing its end, this segment is not going to be much of a help and hence, SunTrust’s overall mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Coming to investment banking activities, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings, thereby having a positive impact on the related fees. However, the trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. Thus, investment banking income is expected to remain muted in the quarter.Nevertheless, given the significantly high volatility experienced in the first quarter, particularly in the months of February and March, trading activities remained strong. This is expected to boost trading income for the company.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Driven by branch consolidation efforts, SunTrust’s expenses have been declining for the past few years. While the company expects core personnel expenses to increase approximately $75 million in the quarter due to the seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses, overall costs are expected to remain low.Now, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are low.

180,STI,"Investors in SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the April 20, 2018 $45 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for SunTrust Banks shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, SunTrust Banks is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Major Regional industry that ranks in the Top 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have dropped the estimates, while our Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged in that period.Given the way analysts feel about SunTrust Banks right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

183,STI,"The American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) is likely to get a breather from the senate’s recent decision to bring in a few amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulations and policies extensively control the company, TRS and its U.S. bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank).The Dodd-Frank Reform was put in place by President Obama in 2010 to prevent the reccurence of the 2008 financial crisis.Amendment to the ActOne of the main tenet of the senate’s banking bill is to raise the minimium threshold bar for institutions that are deemed too big to fail to $250 billion  from $50 billion. This change would bring a relive to the small institutions and will result in a reduction in the number of banking institutions considered “too big to fail.” Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.Some of the beneficiaries of change are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) among others.American Express to Gain from the MoveIf the proposed changes see the light of the day, American Express will no longer have to undergo the annual stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. These tests are designed to evaluate whether the company in question has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to recuperate losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions.The company is now required to maintain capital ratios appreciably above the applicable minimum requirements and buffers. It is also restricted in its ability to make any capital distributions (including dividend and share buy backs). A relaxation of this rule will provide the company increased financial flexibility and greater autonomy in capital allocation.We believe the company will be able to divert buffer capital for business expansion and enhance products.Strong Economy Another BoonLow unemployment, strong consumer confidence and reduction in tax rates bodes well for the company’s business which is directly dependent on consumer spending. The company has witnessed an increase in top line, thanks to increased spending.Lower Tax Rate to Benefit American ExpressA lower tax rate from the tax reform has enabled the company to plan to invest up to $200 million in 2018, for growth. For shareholders, the company expects to use the anticipated benefits to build capital and drive earnings in 2018.The operating environment looks favorable for American Express which in the recent past suffered from loss of one of its biggest client Costco Wholesale Corp. The company thereafter undertook massive growth initiatives which included increased marketing and advertising, higher customer rewards, and investment in customer-facing activities increased frills on cards etc. to woo and retain customers.The tearing away of the stiff capital regulations will further provide an impetus to its business.Shares of the company have gained around 21% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 5% rally.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

184,STI,"On Mar 14, the Senate passed a crucial Bill easing several of the regulations, which were put in place to guard against a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The proposed legislation loosens norms mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which were put in place after the crisis led to many Americans losing their homes and jobs.The major beneficiaries of the new legislation appear to be regional banks, smaller community banks, regional lending institutions and credit unions. Though larger banks also received crucial reprieves, these were minor compared to the relief received by their smaller counterparts.The legislation now faces a crucial test in the House of Representatives, but given the bipartisan support it has received, smaller banks can expect easing up of regulations going forward. With rates set to rise and economic growth looking strong, investing in these banks looks like a smart option at this point. Regional Banks Receive ReprieveThe Senate’s banking Bill aims to raise the threshold for banks which are deemed too big to fail. This limit, currently set at $50 billion in terms of assets, will now be raised to $250 billion. This implies that only the largest U.S. banks would have to abide by the most stringent regulations stipulated by the Federal Reserve.This means that several midsized banks would no longer have to submit “living will” regulations which elaborately specify how banks intend to safely dispose of its assets in case of a failure.  Also, they would no longer have to undergo Federal Reserve stress tests on an annual basis.The beneficiaries of this clause include household names such as BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report).Major Relief for Community BanksOther major beneficiaries of the proposed law are smaller community banks and credit unions. Banks of this nature with less than $10 billion in assets will no longer have to comply with the Volcker Rule. This regulation prevents financial institutions from engaging in speculative trading. It was put in place to stop such banks from selling risky mortgages and to ensure that they could withstand difficult business conditions.Smaller banks have complained for some time that they were subject to rules which were targeted primarily at bigger financial players. A more contentious reprieve intends to reduce reporting requirements for mortgage data. Additionally, smaller banks would no longer have to comply with strict mortgage underwriting norms put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act.This rule was intended to determine whether banks were giving loans only to these individuals who had the ability to pay back these amounts. However, smaller banks have long complained that they find it difficult to comply with such regulations. The Bill’s supporters argue that the relaxation of these clauses will enable easier disbursal of mortgages and business loans, especially in rural areas.Our ChoicesThe Senate’s new bipartisan legislation significantly eases norms for mid-sized and smaller banks. While their ease of doing business will increase substantially if the new law is implemented, compliance related costs will likely decline.A stronger rate environment and an encouraging economic backdrop are already proving to be beneficial for banks. Given that regulatory restrictions are also likely to ease up in the near term, it makes sense to invest in smaller banks at this time.

186,STI,"As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised key rates following its first meeting chaired by Jerome Powell. Once again, the Fed expressed its confidence in the economy, predicting a faster pace of growth for 2018. At the same time, the Fed reiterated that it intends to raise rates only three times this year, sticking to a gradual path of increases.Of course, the Fed did state that it favors a faster pace of rate hikes for 2019. But steady growth and a gradualist approach to rate hikes means that investors can breathe easy. A strong economy and a rising rate environment are likely to benefit financials substantially. Investing in stocks from this sector looks like a smart move at this point.Three Rate Hikes Likely in 2018The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point following its first meeting under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The federal funds rate is utilized by banks to determine rates for car and small business loans, credit cards and mortgages. Following the increase, the target range for benchmark short-term interest rate stands between 1.5% and 1.75%.  This was the sixth rate hike undertaken by the Fed since 2015, approved by a unanimous vote of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). And though the Fed Chair opined that the economic outlook has strengthened, the central bank is sticking to its plan of hiking interest rates only thrice this year. However, the Fed stated this it is likely to hike rate three times instead of two in 2019.Economic Outlook BrightensIn the statement released by the FOMC at the conclusion of its meeting, the committee stated that: “The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.” These views seemingly contradicted an earlier comment that economic activity has been increasing at a “moderate” pace, which struck a softer tone than January’s description of economic expansion as “solid.”Following the meeting, Powell said that the labor market continued to be resilient while economic expansion was occurring at a steady pace. Further, inflation seemed to be nearing its 2% target rate, he said. Powell said that tax cuts, steady job growth, a strong global economic outlook and a low rate environment were principally responsible for the upward revision in the Fed’s outlook.  Further, the FOMC raised its forecast for yearly economic growth to 2.7%, significantly higher than its December projection of 2.5%. Of course, the last forecast was made before Congress passed tax cuts and reached a deal on a $300 billion increase in government expenditure.Additionally, the Fed kept its inflation outlook of 1.9% unchanged while reducing its projection for unemployment from 4.1% to 3.8%. Unemployment is expected to decline to 3.6% by the end of 2019. The forecast for economic growth for the next year was also raised from 2.1% to 2.4%.Our ChoicesEven though the Fed hiked rates at the end of Powell’s first meeting as the central bank’s chairman, it is sticking to its plan of hiking rates only twice again this year. Further, the central bank has substantially increased its growth outlook for the current year.Both these announcements are likely to gladden investors and benefit financial stocks substantially. Investing in banks, insurers and broking companies looks like a prudent option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in.

(STI  -  Free Report) and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), the two major regional banks, have market capitalization of $30.5 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively. Both continue to benefit from organic growth efforts and strong balance sheet.Both banks are influenced by the same economic backdrop as they have almost similar business operations. Further, the improving rate environment is beneficial for them. Also, they are likely to benefit from the industry’s affluence, which is anticipated in the near term, driven by lower tax rates and expectations of lesser regulations under the Trump administration.In terms of price performance, SunTrust’s shares have gained 9.4% so far this year, while M&T Bank’s shares have risen 10.4%.

188,STI,"In my 20+ years of trading and managing complex portfolios, much of which were built using derivatives, these extreme market moves do provide two silver linings. #1 is the ability to pick up quality stocks at prices that are 7-15% below where they were just 7-10 days ago. #2 is the opportunity to use out sized option premiums to create extra portfolio yield and to cushion against any further downside.  And these current macro events very much tend to elevate all options prices regardless of market cap, sector or style bias.  With that in mind I used Zacks #1 and #2 ranked stocks, narrowed my search to Financial and Technology sectors, and filtered further for the highest decile readings of 2 year volatility levels.  The strategy is a simple buy write structure using the regular March expiration as our time period to target. For a quick reminder, we will buy 100 shares of stock and sell one call option which equals 100 shares.  March gives us a solid month for the market to stabilize some and as it does, we make money as elevated premium levels begin to deflate.  As it does, even without our stocks rallying back to their highs, we collect the premium from the now rapidly decaying options.  If stocks fall further, the extra 2-3% we are picking up acts as a cushioning effect against further losses.  This is not a strategy I use all of the time. Many of the expirations over the last year, option premiums were too low to sell calls in a covered write strategy.  I believed selling calls in this low premium, sustained market up move was akin to giving money away.  But now as we sit here today and view the market through this more ""risk off"" prism, selling a call is the correct move ESPECIALLY if you are establishing a new position or adding to an existing one.  So here are 4 Zacks Rank #1 and #2 candidates that I really want to deploy a covered write and capture this elevated premium.(FB  -  Free Report) $174: Not much of an introduction is needed for this social media juggernaut but one thing that is important is that it landed on Zacks's #1 rank list last night!  The March 180 calls trading over $5 today provides a one month yield of nearly 2.9%, annualized at over 34%.  That just doesn't happen with FB and is nearly twice what you'd normally receive. Selling that call, in the event the market rolls over further and takes FB with it, takes your break even in the stock to $169.(INTC  -  Free Report) $43: This chip giant has held up ok during the market sell off sitting right in the middle of its 52 week range.  INTC pays a nice dividend yielding 2.8% and with the MARCH 45 calls trading about $1.10, you pick up another 2.5% for an annualized yield of 30%.  Again, except for maybe impending earnings or market convulsions, the call premiums existing today in INTC are very high.  With a Zacks #2 ranking, pristine balance sheet and global competitive advantages, INTC is prime call write candidate.  (STI  -  Free Report) $66: Sun Trust Banks, a major regional Atlanta based bank, is off about 8.5% from its recent 52 week high of $72.08 but its option premiums are at a 1 and 2 year highs.  With the MARCH 70 calls recently trading $1.25, an investor is grabbing onto a 1.9% 30 day yield, annualized at 22.7%.  These types of trade set ups just don't happen very often.  STI is a Zacks's Rank #2 stock, dividend yield of 2.43% and has banking operations throughout the most desirable regions of the southeastern United States.  (BLK  -  Free Report) $515: Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager and one of the dominant forces in ETF investing, is just a money making machine. It manages trillions of dollars for all types of investors, risk advises for global portfolio managers and recently launched a ""private equity"" like business that will look to take on Blackstone, Carlyle and even Warren Buffet. The stock pays a nice dividend yielding 2.26% and is a Zacks rank #2 stock. Today with the stock trading around $515, you could sell the MARCH 520 calls for around $16.50, giving you a yield of 3.2% for the 30 days. That's about a 32% volatility level for a stock that normally trades in the mid to high teens.  That call sale equates to an annualized 38.4% return, that is a trade set up in BLK that is hard to pass up!To recap, we are initiating these trades because these are tremendous companies, with Zacks Rank of #1 or #2 and the market tumult has given us volatility levels that have reached extremely high levels.  If your investing thought process is ""I would like to add some new names or build on an existing position"", then these investing set ups may be exactly what you are looking for.  Remember, if the stock does nothing from here, you collect the call premiums. If it moves lower, you are protected by the amount of the call sale and if we rip higher from here, your short call will be assigned but you have the stock to deliver along with a very nice profit!

189,STI,"Friday, January 19, 2018For this column, even though there is a chance the U.S. government may shut down today, we will not wade into those waters at this time. Instead, we will let D.C. be D.C. After all, even if the government does shut down, it doesn’t take away the positive results we’ve seen overall so far in Q4 earnings season.Yesterday after the bell we saw good Q4 headlines from companies of diverse industries, from Big Tech play IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) to Transportation’s Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report). Although the devil is in the details for IBM in the quarter just passed, we still see beats on the top and bottom lines and growth year over year.Another transportation firm, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), has this morning topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents to $1.38 per share. The railway major narrowly missed the analyst consensus on quarterly revenues, however, to $660.4 million. Operation income was up in the quarter, though operating ratio was slightly down year over year.

Year over year, Production was up a whopping 146%, with Drilling up 36% from the year-ago quarter.

The good news here is these banks have performed at least as well as the much larger financial institutions.Birmingham, AL-based Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, posted a one-cent beat to 27 cents per share, even counting a one-time tax write-off amounting to 7 cents per share. Revenues of $318 million easily surpassed the $278 million we had anticipated. For more on RF’s earnings, click here.Providence, RI-based Citizens Financial (CFG  -  Free Report) topped bottom-line estimates by 4 cents to 71 cents per share, on $1.48 billion in revenues which also beat the Zacks consensus and rose 6.3% year over year. This marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, with the trailing 4 quarters posting an average positive surprise of 9.1%. For more on CFG’s earnings, click here.Finally, Atlanta, GA-based SunTrust Banks (STI  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #2-rated bank, put up $1.09 per share — 4 cents better than the $1.04 expected and +21% year over year — on an in-line $2.31 billion in quarterly revenues.

190,STI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.7% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is STI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.SunTrust Beats on Q4 Earnings as Revenues ImproveSunTrust’s fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. Also, the figure was up 21% year over year.Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues (supported by higher interest rates), stable adjusted expenses and lower provision for credit losses. Also, improving asset quality was a tailwind. However, a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor.After considering one-time discrete gains including tax reform related benefit, net income available to common shareholders was $710 million, up 58% from the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $4.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06. Also, the figure was up 14% year over year. After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders was $2.2 billion, up 20% from the prior year.Rise in Revenues Supports ResultsTotal revenues for the quarter grew 5% from the prior-year period to $2.27 billion. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 billion.For 2017, total revenues were up 4% from the prior year to $8.99 billion. The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.40 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 7% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin was up 17 basis points (bps) to 3.17%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $833 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The modest rise was largely driven by an increase in commercial real estate related income and wealth management-related income.Non-interest expenses rose 9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.52 billion. The increase was mainly due to several non-recurring items.

193,STI,"We are almost in the middle of the earnings season, with results from more than 250 S&P 500 members already out. Major Banks on the index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector's total earnings) reported 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth registered in the prior quarter.Major banks’ results in fourth-quarter 2017 were aided by an improving economy, higher interest rates and a slight rise in lending activities. Apart from these, strength in investment banking, a strong balance sheet and solid asset quality offered support. But these were not enough to boost their financial performance.Factors that weighed on major banks’ third-quarter financial performance persisted in the fourth quarter as well. These include trading weakness and slowdown in mortgage banking. Also, increased investments in technology to enhance digital offerings led to elevated expense levels.On top of these, earnings were adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to changes in the tax law, though the act will result in gains for banks over the long term.Wondering why should one invest in major banks despite dismal fourth-quarter performance? Well, there are several factors that will likely lead to improved performance for these banks going forward.Factors to Drive EarningsFirstly, if the Federal Reserve sticks to its plan of increasing rates three times in 2018, it will further help banks in expanding net interest margin. This along with rise in loan demand will eventually drive revenue growth.In case the inflation rate improves (the latest data indicates some improvement), there are chances of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed next year. So, banks are anticipated to benefit more.Secondly, while all sectors are likely to benefit from the lower tax rates, major bank are expected to gain the most because they are amongst the highest tax payers in the United States.Also, driven by the tax legislation provisions related to repatriation of overseas cash, banks will be in a win-win situation. This is because, as overseas cash is brought back, it will likely provide an impetus to M&As activities, thereby giving a boost to investment banking. Also, as the act will lower tax rates for wealthy individuals, asset management units of these banks are projected to witness a rise in fund inflow.Finally, growing investor optimism about reduced regulations is likely to boost bank stocks. Once there is a reduction in the number of banks tagged as systemically important financial institutions, the compliance costs for the major banks will decline.Upbeat ExpectationsMajor banks’ earnings are expected to accelerate in 2018 with 22.7% growth compared with 7.1% rise for the Finance sector. Also, we note that the industry is currently positioned at the top 6% out of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Also, major banks seem undervalued compared with the broader finance sector. The industry’s current price-earnings (F1) and price/book ratios of 12.6 and 1.8, respectively, are lower than the finance sector figures.Therefore, we believe investors will benefit by betting on major bank stocks, as the industry is likely to perform better in the near term.Picking the Potential WinnersNot all major banking stocks appear to be wise investment options at the moment. Investors need to pick those stocks that have witnessed robust growth and still have plenty of upside left.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected major banks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

196,STI,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected improve from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s third-quarter 2017 results were hurt by lower trading and mortgage revenues along with higher expenses. The company also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, a decline in provision for loan losses and strong capital position were the tailwinds.The bank has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 16.9%, underperforming 27% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise Is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.45%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 19.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.40.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer front. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The investment banking business witnessed improvement in the quarter and trust income is expected to rise, thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line.However, the overall volume of M&A has remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to decline slightly. Also, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment and hence revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

198,STI,"SunTrust Banks' (STI  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. Also, the figure was up 21% year over year.Results were primarily driven by a rise in revenues (supported by higher interest rates), stable adjusted expenses and lower provision for credit losses. Also, improving asset quality was a tailwind. However, a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor.After considering one-time discrete gains including tax reform related benefit, net income available to common shareholders was $710 million, up 58% from the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $4.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06. Also, the figure was up 14% year over year. After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders was $2.2 billion, up 20% from the prior year.Rise in Revenues Supports ResultsTotal revenues (taxable equivalent basis) for the quarter grew 5% from the prior-year period to $2.31 billion. The figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For 2017, total revenues (FTE basis) were up 4% from the prior year to $9.13 billion. The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.40 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 7% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 17 basis points (bps) to 3.17%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $833 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The modest rise was largely driven by an increase in commercial real estate related income and wealth management-related income.Non-interest expenses rose 9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.52 billion. The increase was mainly due to several non-recurring items. After excluding those, operating expenses were relatively stable.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $741 million as of Dec 31, 2017, down 19% from prior-year quarter.

200,STI,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 18. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, with likely earnings beat on the cards.Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4% in third-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses was the undermining factor.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 2.09%. People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company have gained around 3.1% for the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, outperforming growth of 2.6% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter. Notably, our quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that chances of People's United beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.61%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 12.5% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $392.7 million, up 18.6% year over year.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans declined on a sequential basis during the December-end quarter. Particularly, growth in consumer loans, with slowdown in real estate loans, along with commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. Additionally, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the fourth quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) is +0.18% and the stock flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). The company is scheduled to release December quarter-end results on Jan 24.

201,STI,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 19, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. A stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.7%.However, the company’s activities in the fourth quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.05 witnessed a decline of approximately 1% over the last 7 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.7%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.31 billion reflects an improvement of 7% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has also been impressive. Its shares have gained 22.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is +0.81%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Remain Stable: The fourth quarter witnessed modest loan growth. However, the company projects NII to be relatively stable year over year because balance sheet growth will most likely be offset by pressure on net interest margin (NIM). The company expects the fourth quarter NIM to decline in the range of 1-3 basis points.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Refinancing activities increased during the quarter on the expectation of a higher interest rate environment. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Nonetheless, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. Thus, the related fees are projected to increase for SunTrust. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to the overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks are likely to translate into marginal expense reduction. Further, management expects overall expenses in 2017 to decline, given the low-cost employee benefits, along with the benefits of the company’s efficiency initiatives.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

202,STI,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) and SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), the two major regional banks, have market capitalization of $39.2 billion and $30.7 billion, respectively. Both are part of the same industry, which has a Zacks Industry Rank #60 (top 23%). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Both banks are influenced by same economic backdrop as they have almost similar business operations. Further, the improving rate environment is beneficial for them. Also, they are likely to benefit from the industry’s affluence, which is expected in the near term, driven by lower tax rates and expectations of lesser regulations under the Trump administration.In terms of price performance, BB&T’s shares have gained 5.7% in 2017 while SunTrust’s shares have rallied 17.8%.As businesses of both the banks are almost similar, let’s dig deeper into to the financials, before deciding which one is the better pick.BB&TBB&T has a debt/equity ratio of 0.78, which is below the industry average of 0.88. This reflects that the company has a relatively less debt burden and will be financially stable in adverse economic conditions.Further, the company’s current-year earnings are projected to grow 7.6% while sales are expected to increase 5.7%. Additionally, BB&T has a dividend yield of 2.65%, above the industry average of 1.92%.Analysts seem to have a neutral stance about the stock’s financial performance. For 2017, over the past 30 days, the stock has witnessed one upward revision and one downward revision.Notably, BB&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the company looks overvalued with respect to its P/E (F1) ratio of 16.04 compared with the industry average of 15.97. Also, its PEG ratio of 2.29 is above the industry average of 1.98.SunTrustSunTrust’s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.50 is below the industry average of 0.88. This reflects that the company will be in an advantageous position in stressed economic conditions.Further, SunTrust has a dividend yield of 2.48%, which is above the industry average of 1.92%.Also, its earnings for the current year are projected grow 14.5% while sales growth is estimated to be 5.4%.Analysts seem optimistic about the stock’s earnings prospects. Over the last 30 days, the stock has witnessed two upward revisions (against one downward revision) for 2017.SunTrust carries a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, the stock seems undervalued with respect to its P/E (F1) ratio of 15.89, which is below the industry average of 15.97. The company’s PEG ratio of 1.74 is below the industry average of 1.98.Our TakeBoth BB&T and SunTrust look well positioned in terms of their Zacks Rank and lesser debt burden. Though BB&T has higher sales growth prospects and dividend yield, SunTrust seems to be a better pick given the higher earnings growth rate potential and positive estimate revisions. Also, the SunTrust stock is undervalued.  Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

203,STI,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter and 2017 results, scheduled for Jan 18, are likely to witness a fall in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this might majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments, will likely offset the adverse impact to some extent.The decline in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter.Several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.Also, similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be largely responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.12 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% sequentially and 23.6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.92 billion indicates a rise of 1.5% from the prior quarter. But the same is expected to fall 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, fourth-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $2.86 billion, down 1.8% from the last quarter and 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s fourth-quarter results:Underwriting fees to rise: Despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the world might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $312 million reflects a surge of 38.7% from the prior-year quarter.Further, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this will lead to strong gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $440 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 14.4% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $752 million.Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. But overall loan demand remained weak — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. Therefore, NII is anticipated to witness slight growth.Advisory fees to show weakness: Slowdown in M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have an adverse effect on advisory fees. Thus, Morgan Stanley is not likely to be untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $573 million, down 8.8% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low. Notably, the company expects to lower its expenses by $1 billion in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: Following the passage of the tax act in December 2017, Morgan Stanley announced expectation of one-time charge of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets. However, this will partially be offset by nearly $160 million net discrete tax benefit, mainly related to “the remeasurement of reserves and related interest relating to the status of multi-year Internal Revenue Service tax examinations.”Therefore, the company is anticipated to record a net one-time charge of $1.25 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 77 cents reflects a 4.9% decline on a year-over-year basis. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $9.1 billion indicates 1.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

204,STI,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the consumer banking segment are anticipated to offset the slowdown in trading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected to be $5.6 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the fourth quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.13%. This is a significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank of 3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23%. Notably, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.1% from the prior-year quarter to 87 cents.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly consumer loans, and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise nearly 1% to $421.3 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 1.3% to $385 million on a sequential basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 6.2% sequentially to $327 million.Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $199 billion, down 6.6% sequentially.Expenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately. Also, there will be impact of the one-time charge that comes with the tax overhaul.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 87 cents over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

205,STI,"Expected slump in trading business is likely to adversely affect The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings, to be reported on Jan 17. Nevertheless, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are anticipated to offset the trading slump.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the subdued volatility experienced during the quarter.Several political and geopolitical developments, rising rate environment, passage of the tax act and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of positive catalysts, have been on the downside.Similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed-income trading is likely to be primarily responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a decline of 13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q4 results:Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate: Continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom-line figures. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line. As the interest-rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. Therefore, debt origination fees will lead to solid gains.Also, despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, the fourth quarter turned triumphant. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for banks. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report an impressive quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment banking segment is projected at $1.6 billion, up 6.7% year over year.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer area — might perk up interest income.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $1.6 billion in 2016. The bank is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management will likely aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Additionally, Goldman’s fourth-quarter 2017 results are likely to reflect a $5-billion negative impact triggered by the latest tax reform, which levied taxes on overseas income. Also, deferred tax assets (DTAs) will lose value due to tax cut.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

206,STI,"All the major banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results over the last five trading days reported bottom-line growth. This was mainly driven by a rise in revenues attributable to higher net interest income and loan growth.Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks. Banks were even able to control expense rise. All these led to positive price movement for the stocks over the last five trading sessions.However, mortgage banking continued to disappoint along with muted investment banking performance. These were the primary reasons for lower non-interest income for the banks. Also, higher credit costs remained a headwind.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 20, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

207,STI,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax bill last Saturday, driving investors’ optimism over bank stocks. A significant drop in the corporate tax rate — from 35% to 20% — is one of the major changes proposed in the tax bill.Though low client activities and less volatility across capital markets are expected to hurt banks’ trading revenues in Q4, overall earnings performance is likely to improve on the back of lower taxes.Further, expectations of another rate hike soon, backed by improving U.S. economic data, have boosted investors’ confidence. Mortgage rates increased last week on a bonds sell-off, hitting 3.94%, but remained historically low. In addition, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.367%.Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, acquisitions and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts prevailed over the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Dec 1, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. Major banks expect weak trading revenues in the fourth quarter. At the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) hinted at continued weakness in trading revenues. This is the third time in 2017 that both companies have provided dismal outlook for trading revenues.Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, stated that the company’s trading business so far this quarter has been down nearly 15% year over year. Lake noted that “there haven’t been that many catalysts” and volatility remains ""low across the spectrum.""Likewise, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan predicted the same decline for his company. Both executives cited discouraging comparisons to last year, when volatility was significantly high following the U.S. Presidential election results. Notably, remarks by these executives echo similar comments made in November by Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) CFO Martin Chavez, who said, “The market backdrop that has been in place since the beginning of the year has continued into the fourth quarter. Volatility continues to be low, and client activity continues to be subdued.” (Read more: Banks Appear Unlikely to Benefit From Trading Turnaround)John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) at Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), also foresees a decline in the company’s trading revenues by high teens in the fourth quarter. Also, Trump’s tax reform move is likely to affect the bank’s earnings by a solid $20 million as a one-time charge, after it is enforced as law. He also expects credit card revenues to remain flat in the fourth quarter due to pressure from the recent marketing costs.However, the CFO seemed hopeful about return on tangible common equity, expecting it to rise in 2019 and 2020 due to lower taxes that will result in higher income.

Moody's Investors Service — the rating service arm of Moody's Corp. — affirms or upgrades the major banks’ ratings based on performance and earnings strength. Recently, JPMorgan received rating action from Moody’s. The rating agency affirmed the ratings of the bank and kept its outlook stable. The company’s A3 long-term senior debt rating and Aa2 deposit rating have been affirmed.The ratings are based on JPMorgan’s earnings strength and performance of different business lines. Furthermore, the company’s great liquidity and capital position boosted its credit profile. (Read more: JPMorgan's Ratings Affirmed by Moody's, Outlook Stable)Also, Moody's upgraded the long-term issuer rating of BofA from Baa1 to A3. Additionally, the deposits and senior debt rating of its subsidiary, Bank of America N.A., has been upgraded from A1 to Aa3. Its baseline credit assessment has also been upgraded to baa1 from baa2.On the other hand, short-term ratings and assessments of the company and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by Moody's. Notably, the rating outlook is stable. BofA has witnessed improvement in its profitability in the last few years. Moody’s expects the company to sustain this bottom-line growth in the future as well.

The California Department of Insurance plans to revoke or at least suspend Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) insurance license due to its illegitimate practices relating to the online insurance referral program. The regulator noted that about 1500 fake insurance policies were opened by the company without customers’ knowledge. Wells Fargo is said to have wrongly charged them with premiums.Earlier this week, the banking giant’s CEO Tim Sloan commented on the regular screening of its operations during the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. He had said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” This adds to the many other problems the bank has been facing since the fake accounts scandal surfaced in late 2016.  (Read more: Wells Fargo's Insurance License Likely to Get Revoked)4. Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) has been accused of charging illegal overdraft fees from customers. Per a Reuters report, a federal appeals court recently revived the proposed class-action lawsuit, which had been filed against the company earlier for its wrongdoing. According to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, the rules for charging overdraft fee of Capital One were quite confusing and ambiguous.Thus, a lower court judge had wrongly dismissed a breach of contract claim. Ideally, if a bank pays its merchant for purchases made by customers, who do not have enough money in their accounts, it charges an overdraft fee of nearly $35.

(STI  -  Free Report) closed the deal to divest its commercial lines insurance premium finance subsidiary — Premium Assignment Corporation (“PAC”) — to Kansas City, MO-based IPFS Corporation. Financial details of the deal, announced in September, were not revealed. The sale is part of SunTrust’s strategy to focus on core Wholesale Banking operations. SunTrust intends to improve profitability by focusing on Wholesale Banking business. (Read more: SunTrust Closes Insurance Premium Finance Subsidiary Deal)6. Amid ongoing developments in the U.S. banking sector, CEO Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo is optimistic on the loan scenario in the fourth quarter based on improved customer activity. During the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Sloan commented on the regular screening of the bank’s operations. He said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” According to him, some other areas of mistakes might standout as the bank continues to make improvements.Further, growth in economy is likely to have spurred some customer activity on the consumer and commercial front during the quarter. He expects consumer activity to gain momentum when Trump becomes successful in enforcing the tax bill. In the third quarter, the bank reported nearly 1% drop in its loan portfolio, year over year.He anticipates the commercial and industrial (C&I) lending scenario to be better in the fourth quarter. However, he expects the mortgage segment to be impacted by seasonality during the last quarter, resulting in sluggish growth. Sloan anticipates the auto lending segment to improve late next year.

208,STI,"A favorable operating backdrop with the anticipation of another interest rate hike by the Fed has driven investors’ optimism for banking stocks. So it’s a good idea to bet on some bank stocks that possess strong fundamentals and have solid growth prospects.SunTrust Banks (STI  -  Free Report) is one such stock. Easing margin pressure, rise in loan demand and improving asset quality are the major driving factors. Further, initiatives to control costs are encouraging. However, its significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios remains a concern. Also, continued slowdown in mortgage activities is likely to adversely impact non-interest income.This financial services company reported in-line earnings in third-quarter 2017. The results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and a slight fall in operating expenses. Also, a stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. Then again, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) acted as headwinds.Shares of SunTrust have gained 12.4% over the past 12 months, underperforming 16.9% growth recorded by the industry.However, the company’s earnings estimates inched up marginally for the current year, over the last 30 days. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).SunTrust continues to record a downtrend in expenses. Non-interest expenses declined at a four-year (ended 2016) CAGR of 2.1%, mainly driven by branch consolidation efforts. Also, it remains undeterred in its plans to improve efficiency and targets a tangible efficiency ratio in the range of 61–62% this year and below 60% by 2019-end.In 2016, the company reported a rise in net interest margin (NIM) after facing a declining trend for years. Also, the company has been increasing its prime lending rate, subsequent to the Fed’s rate hikes. Net interest income (NII) has witnessed a three-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 3.9%. Both NIM and NII maintained an uptrend during the first nine months of 2017. Further, management is undertaking efforts to enhance revenue growth through several initiatives.On the flipside, the company continues to witness a volatile trend in non-interest income. This is mainly due to lower mortgage production and mortgage servicing-related income. Chances of mortgage-related income improving significantly in the near term are low. Hence, the slowdown in mortgage business is expected to continue hurting the company’s non-interest income in the near term.Further, we remain concerned about SunTrust’s significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios. The company’s exposure to these loan portfolios constitute over 80% of total loans held for investments. Although the housing sector has shown considerable improvement, any further deterioration in real estate prices will pose a problem for the company.Some better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Erste Group Bank AG (EBKDY  -  Free Report), The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited (NTB  -  Free Report) and Stifel Financial Corporation (SF  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).

209,STI,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth. Also, it is critical in securing the support that was lacking from the earlier efforts to lessen undue regulatory burden.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

210,STI,"The expected fall in Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) trading revenues will likely have an adverse impact on fourth-quarter 2017 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Nevertheless, this may not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 16. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to offset the trading slump.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, interest-rate hikes, tax act movements and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of positive catalysts, have been on the downside.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, the low level of volatility in the fourth quarter, particularly compared to last year when market was reacting actively to the U.S. election, is likely to take a toll on trading revenues. He projects high-teens year-over-year decline in trading revenues. Fixed income and foreign exchange segments, on which the company depends significantly, are likely to have been affected the most.Gerspach also said that he projects revenues from Citi-branded credit cards in North America to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Pressure has been put on the revenues due to the company’s extensive marketing strategy.Other Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued modest year-over-year revenue growth, and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in fourth-quarter 2017. In total, sequential growth in pre-tax earnings in Global Consumer banking is recorded for the last two quarters and is anticipated to continue into the fourth quarter as well.Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate: Continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom-line numbers. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line. As the interest-rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. Therefore, debt origination fees will lead to solid gains.Also, despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, the fourth quarter turned triumphant. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for banks. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report an impressive quarter.On the institutional side, continued year-over-year revenue growth in accrual businesses, including TTS, the Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated. Markets revenues are likely to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. However, some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer area — might perk up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to be in line, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG, offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Net credit-card losses are likely to worsen. Rate in the branded-cards business is expected to be 285 basis points (bps) in 2017 and expand about 10 bps in 2018. Also, in the retail-services business, rate is expected to be 470 bps in 2017 and increase to 500 bps in 2018.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Notably, in early December 2017 (before the passage of the tax act), Citigroup executive had noted that the U.S. corporate tax overhaul will hurt earnings in the fourth quarter. The company had expected one-time charge of $16-$17 billion related to the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs) and charge related to cash repatriation to be around $3-$4 billion.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

211,STI,"The expected fall in JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenues will likely have an adverse impact on fourth-quarter 2017 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Nevertheless, this may not lead the company to report bleak results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are expected to offset the trading slump.Also, though market volatility has not improved much in the last quarter, the decrease in trading revenues will primarily be attributable to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed significantly higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.At an investor conference in early December 2017, Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down roughly 15% year over year. Lake further said “there haven’t been that many catalysts” and volatility remains ""low across the spectrum.""Similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be primarily responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $2.86 billion reflects a decline of 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.57 billion indicates a marginal rise from the last-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence JPMorgan’s Q4 results:Continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances.As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this will lead to strong gains.Also, despite being seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for JPMorgan.The company projects investment banking income to be up in high-single-digits range for the fourth quarter.Steady rise in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in improvement in interest income.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Seasonality is also expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues. Moreover, JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. Mortgage banking revenues are expected to be down 7.3% year over year to $1.57 billion.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact JPMorgan’s earnings unusually.Impact of new tax code: In early December 2017 (before the passage of the tax act), JPMorgan executive had noted that the U.S. corporate tax overhaul will hurt earnings in the fourth quarter. The company had expected one-time charge related to cash repatriation to be more than $2 billion.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:JPMorgan does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.05%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

212,STI,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. Also, lower provision for credit losses was a positive.Moreover, SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.3%.However, the company’s activities in the third quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.06 remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.29 billion reflects an improvement of 4.2% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has not been that impressive. Its shares have gained 7.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9.6%.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteWill the price performance improve post Q3 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are bleak. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is -0.18%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Moreover, the company expects net interest margin in the quarter to range from 3.14-3.16%, up from 2.96% in the prior-year quarter. Thus, higher NIM should further boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenue is not expected to witness much improvement.Nevertheless, given that the overall equity markets witnessed some improvement in the quarter, trust income is expected to rise. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks should translate into marginal expense reduction.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Invesco Ltd.

Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s second-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and decline in provision for loan losses. These factors also helped it in surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the last three months, shares of PNC Financial have gained 7.5% compared with 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 5.1%. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

214,STI,"The expected fall in Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading income will adversely impact its third-quarter earnings, slated on Friday, Oct 13. However, the bank is anticipated to record year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues.BofA’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved investment banking fees and higher net interest income while trading income witnessed a slump. The same tough operating backdrop continued in the third quarter as well.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 1.1% downward over the last 30 days.Earnings WhispersDecrease in earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:BofA does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -0.66%.Zacks Rank: BofA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects 10.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Further, BofA has a decent surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteFactors to Impact Q3 ResultsTrading slump: The third quarter appears to be disappointing for BofA in terms of trading business similar to the prior quarter. In September, the bank’s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio projected nearly 15% year-over-year decline in trading income. Similar to the last quarter, slump in fixed-income revenues is expected to be the primary reason for this decline.While the fall is largely attributable to higher-than-usual volatility in the year-ago quarter, trading activities remained sluggish in the third quarter. Absence of any tangible development on the proposed reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the main reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter.Investment banking to offer some support: Given the higher debt originations during the quarter (mainly on expectation of persistent rise in interest rates), debt underwriting fees are expected to continue rising in the to-be-reported quarter. However, overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter are expected to result in a decline in the related fees. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a significant loss.Mortgage revenues not to be a major support: An expected higher rate environment might have led to a rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping BofA record some mortgage revenues. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no big support is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, management expects NII to increase sequentially, assuming realization of the forward curve and modest growth in loans and deposits. Nonetheless, the sale of non-U.S. consumer credit card operation will have a marginal negative impact.Reduced scope for cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses should remain more or less stable.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few major bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

216,STI,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 17, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has a decent earnings surprise history as its earnings have not lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 2%.However, activities of Schwab during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteNotably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 30.1% in 2017, outperforming the 19.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -0.72%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAlthough, market volatility did not improve much in the fourth quarter when compared with the prior-year quarter, overall trading activities remained relatively decent. Moreover, Schwab opened 117,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in October and November 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the fourth quarter is 10,696, which is projected to witness year-over-year improvement of 5.3%.Thus, with the growth in brokerage accounts, trading revenues might have witnessed modest improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in October and November on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the quarter as well.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.3 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $220 billion, which is expected to grow 6.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is projected to be $2.23 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 12.9% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated since the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the fourth quarter as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

217,STI,"SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.06 per share were in line the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the figure was up 16% year over year.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and a slight fall in operating expenses. Also, stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.Net income available to common shareholders was $512 million, up 12% from the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Growth Offsets Higher CostsTotal revenues (FTE basis) for the quarter grew 4% from the prior-year period to $2.31 billion. The figure was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 19 basis points (bps) to 3.15%, reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $846 million, down 5% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower mortgage related income, partially offset by a rise in investment banking income.Non-interest expenses were down 1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion. The fall was mainly due to a lower outside processing and software costs.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $792 million as of Sep 30, 2017, down 22% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 19 bps year over year to 0.48% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 14 bps year over year to 0.21% of total average loans held for investment. However, provision for credit losses increased 24% from the year-ago quarter to $120 million reflecting anticipated losses from hurricanes.Strong Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2017, SunTrust had total assets of $208.3 billion while shareholders’ equity was $24.5 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Sep 30, 2017, loans held for investments were relatively stable on a sequential basis at $144.3 billion. Total consumer and commercial deposits grew nearly 2% from the prior quarter to $161.8 billion.SunTrust’s estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was 9.62% as of Sep 30, 2017.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, the company bought back shares worth $330 million.Our ViewpointSunTrust remains well positioned for growth given its favorable deposit mix and enhanced credit quality. Easing margin pressure and initiatives to enhance efficiency should support the company’s revenues.However, the company’s significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios remains a major near-term concern. Also, slowdown in mortgage business makes us apprehensive.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Results reflected increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, the company was successful in reducing expenses on the back of its GEAR Up initiative. However, higher provisions and a fall in loans balance remained major headwinds.KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016) and higher interest rates. Further, lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were the tailwinds. On the other hand, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

219,STI,"The expected decline in Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading income is likely to adversely impact fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, slated on Wednesday, Jan 17. However, this is not expected to lead to dismal results as gains from higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are anticipated to offset the trading weakness.Moreover, though market volatility has not improved much in the last quarter, the decrease in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results.At an investor conference in early December 2017, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down roughly 15% year over year. In fact, there has been hardly any change in the scenario since then.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $3.54 billion reflects a marginal rise of 1.9% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s Q4 results:Continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing advisory and underwriting fees is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter largely on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances.However, weaker M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have a slight adverse effect on advisory fees. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a significant loss.Overall, the company projects investment banking income to be up in mid-single-digits range in the fourth quarter. For BofA, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $4.92 billion reflects a rise of 8.2% year over year.Steady rise in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in improvement in net interest income (NII). Further, management expects NII in the to-be-reported quarter to increase sequentially, driven by modest growth in loans and deposits.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this division. Seasonality is also expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues. Moreover, BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $8.91 billion indicates 9.8% improvement from the prior-year quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses are likely to remain more or less stable.Adverse impact of new tax code: In December 2017 (following the passage of the tax act), BofA announced expectation of one-time charge of $3 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -1.14%.Zacks Rank: BofA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

220,STI,"After the Federal Reserve signaled a likely rate hike by the end of this year, hopes were renewed among investors targeting bank stocks. The Fed announced that it would raise the interest rates four more times by the end of next year. This came as a sweet surprise for investors, as they were not expecting any update on rate hike this time around.The news led to an increase in SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) by 1.6% in the past two days as against a 0.2% decline recorded by the S&P 500 index.As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed’s target level, chances of an interest rate hike were low this time around among market participants. However, investors were waiting for another important decision that is likely to significantly benefit banks.Putting all speculation to rest, the Fed finally announced that it will begin reducing its balance sheet starting next month. The Fed’s balance sheet stands currently at a staggering $4.5 trillion, thanks to its efforts to increase liquidity by large-scale purchases of assets during the last financial crisis. The decision to unwind was the result of months of vigilant research and hard work put in by the central bank to tighten the monetary policy.Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, said in the meeting that the economy was strong enough to survive further rate increases and the reduction in the balance sheet.Why Are Banks Likely to Profit?Anticipation of Rate Hike: Banks typically benefit from rising interest rates. The benefit primarily comes from a steep yield curve, i.e. when the spread between long-term and short-term rates is wide. Deposits usually carry short-term rates while loans are often tied to long-term rates.Accordingly, a rise in rates enables banks to charge more for loans, leading to an increase in their spread income. Also, rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy that boosts banking business.Downsizing of Balance Sheet: Balance sheet reduction is also going to profit banks. That’s because if the Fed decides to buy back some or all short-term duration securities, the yield curve will be steeper. This means that the yield on long-term bonds will increase. This will also lead to improved margin spreads for banks.Choosing the Winning StocksWhile the Fed’s moves will likely benefit the entire banking sector, stocks that been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a favorable Zacks Rank should generate solid returns.  BancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

221,STI,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to growth in consumer loan portfolio. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though, flatter yield curves offset the benefits to some extent, pressure on PNC Financial’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017.Moreover, President Trump’s success in executing the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter, which would greatly support PNC Financial’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.17 billion indicates a 7.6% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.6%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 21.8%, outperforming the 18.8% growth recorded by the industry.PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +0.55%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Though, earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 have been revised slightly downward over the past 30 days, they reflect year-over-year growth of 11.7% and 15.5%, respectively.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly in the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.39 billion, up 12.1% year over year.Management expects its net interest income for the to-be-reported quarter to increase in low-single digits on a sequential basis.Controlled Expenses: The company had a cost-saving program in place during the year to keep expenses under control. However, these efforts are likely to be partially offset by one-time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform.Muted Non-Interest Income: The fourth quarter was exceptionally good for the investment banking and underwriting business, which might support the company’s fee income.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower. Per the consensus estimate, total non-interest income is expected to be $1.75 billion, slightly up year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

222,STI,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues and rise in assets under management (AUM).Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 3%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteBlackRock’s business activities and prospects have encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.99 has increased 1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 16.5%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company gain 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the 32.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the rally in share price continue post Q4 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on if the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q4 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.42%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Q4 ResultsWith its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs, BlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. Driven by steady inflows, the company’s AUM is likely to witness further improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.15 trillion, which reflects a rise of 19.5% year over year.As a result of higher AUM in the quarter, the company’s investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 85% of the total revenues, is also expected to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.04 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 5.2%.Moreover, since the New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions. Higher fee rate, coupled with growth in AUM will likely support performance fees growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fee for the fourth quarter is $149 million, which is expected to witness growth of 15.5% year over year.Improvement in two of the major revenue components will likely give a boost to total revenues as well. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.32 billion, which reflects growth of 14.8% year over year.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

Over the past 60 days, the stock has witnessed three upward estimate revisions for 2017 and four upward estimate revisions for 2018.

Continuous investment in new products, new business wins and the GE Asset Management acquisition will likely strengthen the company’s revenue generation in the quarters ahead.Additionally, its projected sales growth of 13.5% in 2017 and 5.4% in 2018 ensures continuation of the upward revenue trend.Earnings per Share Growth: State Street has recorded an earnings growth rate of 19.9% over the last three to five years.

The company’s 2017 capital plan (approved by the Federal Reserve) included an 11% dividend hike and $1.4 billion share repurchase authorization. Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is expected to be able to sustain improved capital deployments and continue enhancing shareholders’ value.Strong Leverage: State Street’s debt/equity ratio is 0.61 compared with the industry average of 0.88, indicating relatively lower debt burden. This reflects the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): State Street’s ROE of 13.03% compared with the industry average of 10.29%, mirrors the company’s strong position over its peers.Stock Looks Undervalued: State Street stock seems undervalued when compared with the broader industry.

224,STI,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 16. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — stronger GDP growth, rise in consumer spending and increasing business spending — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $812.8 million for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 12.6%.Further, management’s positive outlook for 2018 on the back of lower taxes and expectations of loan growth might lead the stock to new highs.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to a fall in expenses and higher revenues. It had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by lower loan balance and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.13%.These positive earnings surprises along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 23.2% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 14.6% rally.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteA Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the fourth quarter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.43%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $66.4 billion reflects a marginal sequential growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the fourth quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, the improvement of investment banking and equity markets might lend further support. However, poor mortgage activity during the quarter is likely to partially offset the positive.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might continue to trend down in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives. However, costs are likely to be affected slightly by the tax overhaul.Credit Quality Might Improve: With the improvement in oil prices during the quarter, normalization of credit metrics is likely to continue. The consensus estimate shows 3.1% and 2.9% rise in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a sequential basis.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.26% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

225,STI,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 94 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. The figure also came in 4.4% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Results benefitted from an improvement in both net interest revenues and fee revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a marginal rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $983 million, increasing nearly 1% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 2.1% year over year to $4.01 billion. The figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $851 million, up 8% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.Additionally, net interest margin grew 10 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter to $3.17 billion. The rise was primarily driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.60 billion, increasing 1% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, AUM was $1.82 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $32.2 trillion were up 6% year over year. Higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $94 million, down from $109 million registered in the prior-year quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 8.8% year over year to $161 million.

Leverage capital ratio was 6.8%, up from 6.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $650 million.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based income remains a major concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

226,STI,"On Thursday, banking giant, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), was fined by the U.S. regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), on failure of meeting the regulatory requirements related to its anti-money laundering policies. Notably, the bank has agreed to pay $70 million as civil penalty.In 2012, Citigroup faced a complaint related to its money-laundering safeguards and was thereby ordered to improve the shortcomings. However, the OCC revealed that the bank has faulted on its compliance efforts and failed in maintaining effective controls.The bank extended full co-operation to the regulators without admitting or denying the wrongdoings and agreed for the charges.“Citi is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to remedy the concerns identified by the OCC,” Rob Runyan, a Citigroup spokesman, said in a statement. The bank has made “substantial investments” to improve its money-laundering protections, he added.Previously, in May 2017, Citigroup and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had entered into a settlement agreement related to the criminal investigation at the bank's Banamex USA (BUSA) unit. The unit was probed for violating anti-money laundering (AML) rules and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The settlement agreement was non-prosecution and included an amount of $97 million to be paid by Citigroup.In 2015 also, the bank paid $140 million as settlement to regulators over loopholes in its AML program. The penalty amount imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. included $40 million to be paid to California's Department of Business Oversight as civil penalties.Similar Issues with Other BanksEarlier in 2017, Deutsche Bank AG (DB  -  Free Report) also paid a $425 million fine as it was accused for involvement in a plan which illegally laundered $10 billion out of Russia.Notably, in 2012, HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC  -  Free Report) was blamed for substantial lapses in its anti-money laundering compliance and was fined $1.9 billion for misdeeds.ConclusionBanks across the globe have been facing heightened scrutiny for their business practices. Many of the firms have paid billions of dollars as fines and compensation to settle lawsuits and probes. Many investors have lost their hard-earned money as a result of such business malpractices. Such settlements help restore their confidence in law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, it reduces the existing litigation burden of banks.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Citigroup have gained 11.7% in the last six months compared with 12.1% growth recorded by the industry.A better-ranked bank — SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) — has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days. Additionally, the stock jumped more than 14% over the past six months.

228,STI,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, this compares favorably with 30 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016) and higher interest rates. Further, lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were the tailwinds. On the other hand, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Including merger-related charges and a merchant services gain adjustment, net income from continuing operations came in at $349 million or 32 cents per share. This was up significantly from $165 million or 16 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.First Niagara Deal, Higher Rates Drive Revenues, Expenses RiseTotal revenuesgrew 16.2% year over year to $1.55 billion. However, it was slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income jumped 22.1% year over year to $962 million.

Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations grew 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.15%.Non-interest income was $592 million, an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in all fee income components,except Investment banking and debt placement fees, and net gains from principal investing, drove the increase.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) rose 7.1% year over year to $956 million. The increase reflected a full-quarter impact of the First Niagara acquisition, ongoing business investments and recent acquisitions, partially offset by merger cost savings.Loans & Deposits Rise MarginallyAt the end of the third quarter, average total deposits were $103.1 billion, up 0.3% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86.8 billion, up 0.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 8 bps year over year to 0.15%.

230,STI,"As expected by the markets, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) has announced a raise in its stock dividend. This followed the approval of its 2017 capital plan by the Federal Reserve in June.SunTrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents per share, up a whopping 54% from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Sep 15 to shareholders on record as of Aug 31. Based on the last day’s closing price of $58.05 per share, the dividend yield is 2.76%.Additionally, SunTrust’s capital plan includes authorization to repurchase $1.32 billion worth of shares, through the third quarter of 2018.Other than SunTrust, several other major regional banks including BB&T Corp. (BBT  -  Free Report), Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) increased their quarterly dividends (as part of their 2017 capital plan) in the range of 10–60%.Given its solid liquidity position, earnings strength and lower debt level, SunTrust is likely to be able to sustain improved capital deployments and also continue enhancing shareholders’ value going forward. But is it worth considering this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to earn this dividend income?Let’s dig deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and rewards.SunTrust’s net revenue witnessed compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1%, over the last four years (2013–2016). The increase has been backed by strong loan and deposit growth along with the efforts to enhance revenue growth through several initiatives. The company’s projected sales growth for 2017 is 5.2%.Further, SunTrust has witnessed 13.3% rise in earnings per share over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS growth is 13.7% and 9.2% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Also, SunTrust’s cost-saving measures have borne results and support profitability. Though non-interest expenses declined at a four-year CAGR (2013–2016) of 2.1%, the trend reversed in the first half of 2017 and in 2016 (in sync with its efforts to enhance revenue growth). Nonetheless, as the company continues with its initiatives of consolidating branches, the overall expense level is expected to remain manageable.Despite these favorable trends, the stock has gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 7.2% so far this year.SunTrust’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Though the company’s ROE of 7.60% has gradually improved over the years, it compares unfavorably with ROE of 8.72% for the industry and 15.66% for the S&P 500, reflecting its low efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Additionally, SunTrust stock looks overvalued based on its price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.25, which is near its high over the last five years.Also, the stock has a Value Style Score of ‘C’. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of ‘value traps’ and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of ‘A’ or ‘B’, when combined with Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.With a steady dividend income opportunity, SunTrust stock appears to be a good investment option now based on its strong fundamentals. However, investors should keep an eye on the stock’s performance as it is significantly overvalued.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

232,STI,"SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.03 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. Also, the figure was up 10% year over year.Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. Also, modest loan growth acted as a tailwind. A decline in provision for credit losses was another positive for the company.Net income available to common shareholders was $505 million, up 6% year over year.Net Interest Income Growth Offsets Higher CostsTotal revenue (FTE basis) for the quarter grew 2% from the prior-year quarter to $2.27 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.44 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher net interest margin (NIM).On a year-over-year basis, NIM was up 15 basis points (bps) to 3.14%, reflecting higher earning asset yields, favorable impact of continued positive mix shift in the loan portfolio and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio.Non-interest income was $827 million, down 8% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower net securities gains, mortgage production related income and other non-interest income.Non-interest expenses were up 3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion. The rise was mainly due to an increase in most expense categories, other than operating losses and other non-interest expense.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $821 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 18% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 15 bps year over year to 0.52% of total loans held for investment.Further, provision for credit losses declined 38% from the year-ago quarter to $90 million. Also, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 19 bps year over year to 0.20% of total average loans held for investment.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, SunTrust had total assets of $207.2 billion while shareholders’ equity was $24.5 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Jun 30, 2017, loans were marginally up on a sequential basis to $144.3 billion.

Easing margin pressure (given the improvement in interest rates) and initiatives to enhance efficiency should support the company’s revenues.However, the company’s significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios remains a major near-term concern. Any deterioration in the real estate prices will pose a problem.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc.

After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $631 million or 77 cents per share compared with $541 million or 66 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues up, Costs DownTotal revenue (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.90 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 1.1% from the prior-year quarter to $1.68 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 6 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.47%.Non-interest income increased nearly 8% year over year to $1.22 billion. Rise in almost all fee income components, except mortgage banking income, led to the growth. Also, the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income.Non-interest expense of $1.74 billion decreased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a fall in amortization of intangibles, net merger-related and restructuring charges and outside IT services related costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.6%, down from 59.6% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Jun 30, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157 billion, down from $161.3 billion in the prior-quarter. However, total loans and leases were $145.1 billion, up 0.8% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $690 million, down 22.1% year over year.

These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Moreover, consistent growth in loans along with improving rate scenario should propel its organic growth trajectory.However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

237,STI,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. The figure also came 17% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Better-than-expected results were driven by higher revenues and benefit from provisions. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a slight rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $926 million, up 12% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenue (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $3.95 billion. Further, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $838 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and lower premium amortization, partly offset by a fall in average interest-earning assets and higher average long-term debt.Additionally, net interest margin grew 18 basis points to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased 4% from the prior-year quarter to $3.12 billion. The rise was mainly driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) amounted to $2.59 billion, up 1% year over year. This reflects a rise in expenses in nearly all categories, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, sub-custodian costs and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was $1.77 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values and net inflows, partly offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $31.1 trillion were up 5% year over year. Higher market values largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets declined 6.5% year over year to $100 million.

The dividend will be paid on Aug 11 to shareholders on record as of Aug 1.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its efficient expense management, strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risks arising from significant dependence on fee-based income along with regulatory restrictions remain matters of concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
