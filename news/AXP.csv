0,AXP,"American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 18. The company’s performance is likely to reflect gains from its four focus areas — strengthening leadership in the premium consumer segment; extending leadership in commercial payments, and in particular, with small and medium-sized enterprises; enhancing its digital platform; and strengthening its global integrated network to provide unique value. Results are likely to also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.Revenues in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to see an upside from accelerated growth in billings along with continued strength in loans and fees. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues — net of interest expenses — are expected to be $10 billion, up 20.6% year over year.The company has suspended its share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in an effort to boost its capital. Consequently, the bottom line will not receive any benefits of share buyback. The company recently announced to commence share buyback in the third quarter of 2018.Factors Affecting Q2 ResultsGrowth in Billed Business: The company is anticipated to witness an increase in worldwide billed business across its diverse customer segments and geographies in the second quarter. U.S. proprietary consumer and international proprietary consumer billings growth are likely to remain strong. The company’s U.S Platinum franchise is anticipated to drive growth in billed business.Global Network Services billed business is expected to grow at a slower rate over the year than the proprietary business due to the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, card billed business revenue is expected to be $294 billion, up 8.9% year over year.Increase in Loan and Receivables: Growth in Card Member loan and receivables is anticipated as the company continues to expand its relationship with existing customers while acquiring new Card Members.Increase in Total Cards in Force: Total cards in force, which reflects the number of cards that are issued and outstanding, is likely to increase in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 118 million, up 5.4% year over year.Slowdown in Net Interest Income: The company has been expecting a steady increase in net interest yield for some time and is anticipating some stabilization on this front. Thus, the company expects growth in net interest income to slow down through the year.Increase in Provisions for Losses: We expect to witness an increase in provision for losses, led by growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in the lending write-off and delinquency rates.Higher Expenses: The second quarter must have endured an increase in expenses. The rise would have been primarily due to growth in rewards expenses and other costs associated with increased Card Member spending, higher usage of card benefits, and continued investments in cobrand partnerships.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company has an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.5%.

1,AXP,"After the worst first half performance since 2010, the Dow Jones has shown some strength at the start of the second half. This is especially true as the blue-chip index had its best day in a month on Jul 9, which pushed back the index to a positive territory for the year. The gains came on the back of a strong jobs report and Q2 earnings optimism amid trade tensions (read: Winning & Losing Sector ETFs From June Jobs Data).  Further, the index closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly three weeks, a positive sign for its short-term momentum trend.

3,AXP,"A strong U.S. economy, low unemployment and wage gains  have fueled a rise in retail spending and in turn placed Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) in a bright spot. A strong macroeconomic backdrop coupled with the company’s strong fundamentals and a rapid shift in the usage of cards for payments have greatly benefited the stock of this company.Year to date, the stock has gained 29.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 16%. This performance looks all the more attractive compared with the gains of 15% for Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and a decline of 1.5% in American Express Inc. (AXP  -  Free Report). Both these players share the same space as Mastercard.We can get an insight into Mastercard’s superior performance from its earnings surprise history of a beat in 25 out of 27 quarters. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 per share implies 40% year-over-year growth.What’s the Catalyst Behind This GrowthIncreasing Revenues: The company’s net revenues grew 27% on a constant currency basis, upholding the top-line growth of the past many years. The company has witnessed a revenue CAGR of 11% from 2012-2017. This growth has been achieved on the back of new deals, renewed agreements, technological investments, acquisitions and widening of geographic footprint. An increase in the number of transactions processed from an increase in spending due to high consumer confidence amid a strong economy has also aided top-line growth.Growth of its Value Added Services: Continuous diversification of its business beyond core payments has fared well for the company. Its services business now represents 25% of total revenues, which differentiates it from the market. These services are in the areas of Analytics, Fraud and Loyalty, and B2B offerings, which can help it maintain above-average long-term organic revenue growth.  Moreover, it has a diversified customer profile that includes merchants, governments, telecommunications companies and digital players.Digital Innovations: Numerous trends in the digital market, such as demand for faster payments and the application of emerging technology, present opportunities for growth. To this end, the company has launched and extended products and platforms that take advantage of the growing digital economy. Some of recent developments in 2017 are expansion of the use of Masterpass, Mastercard Send and Quick Response codes. The company’s digital innovations keep it ahead in the race in a fast-changing payments’ industry.Expansion in the Business-to-Business (B2B) Market: The company’s market share in commercial products is growing globally, as its offers solutions with travel and entertainment, procurement, fleet and virtual cards. The company estimates that there is $120 trillion in addressable payment flows in B2B globally, of which approximately $100 trillion is related to cash and checks, giving the company immense opportunity.To address this opportunity, the company is expanding its capabilities to capture non-carded payment flows with new solutions, such as the Mastercard B2B Hub, Mastercard Send for cross-border payments, and real-time account-based payment systems for ACH transactions. The company launched the innovative Mastercard B2B Hub platform in 2017 to enable small and midsized businesses to optimize their invoice and payment processes with automation tools that improve the speed, ease and security of their commercial payments. The company’s B2B offering should lead to long-term growth.Enhanced Safety and Security: The company has also been making huge investments in enhancing the safety and security of the transactions made on its network from cyber crime. To this end, in 2017, it acquired Brighterion and NuData Security, launched Early Detection System, expanded Safety Net, expanded AI across its network with Decision Intelligence.These fundamental strengths of the company have favored the stock and there seems to be no end here since investments in different platforms, acquisitions and deals would lead to business growth.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering is WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report), which carries the same Zacks Rank as Mastercard. It beat earnings estimates in each of the four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

4,AXP,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has been notified by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that the regulatory body has no objections to the company’s capital actions through Jun 30, 2019.Per the company’s capital plan, it would increase its next quarterly dividend from 35 cents to 40 cents per share of common stock. During the four quarters ending Jun 30, 2019, it has also approved a share repurchase of up to $1.85 billion, reflecting its commitment to generate long-term value for shareholders.The board of directors is anticipated to approve a dividend hike and a new share buyback program at its July meeting. The new repurchase program would be replacing the present one.The passage of the company’s capital plan is indicative of its stable capital structure even under stress-test scenarios. This also implies that a planned capital deployment including dividend hikes and share buybacks are viable and acceptable in relation to the regulatory body’s minimum capital requirements. This should further cement investor's confidence in the company.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a strong performance with the bottom line beating estimates by 2.8%. This better-than-expected result carried on its positive earnings streak of from the preceding two quarters. Going forward, we expect the company to continue well with the winning trend, driven by its revenue momentum, a strong direct banking business, soaring card sales volume and an effective capital management.Recently, other companies like American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) also announced that they will raise the quarterly dividend by 11.4% and 27%, respectively, post the Fed stress test. The companies also approved a respective $3.4 billion and $1.068 billion of common stock share buyback activity. Whereas, Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) expects to maintain its quarterly dividend at 40 cents per share, subject to approval by its Board of Directors apart from announcing a share repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of the company’s common stock.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 13.07% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.90%.

5,AXP,"American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) announced that it will increase the quarterly dividend by 11.4% to 39 cents per share, beginning the third quarter. It also plans to repurchase up to $3.4 billion of common shares during the CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) approval period of the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.This announcement came on the back of a “no-objection” nod received by the company from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to its capital plan submitted recently. The plan submission was part of the 2018 CCAR.A regulatory framework of the Federal Reserve, CCAR assesses, regulates and supervises large banks and financial institutions. American Express is subject to this regulatory framework, given its huge operations and global presence.The passage of American Express’ capital plan bears testimony to the company’s adequate capital possession as well as its stable capital structure under various stress-test scenarios. The green signal also implies that planned capital distributions, such as dividends and share repurchases, are viable and acceptable in relation to the regulatory body’s minimum capital requirements.Some other companies having announced a quarterly dividend  raise and a share buyback boost post passing the Fed Stress Test are JPMorgan Chase &Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report)American Express recovered well recently after losing out a major client, Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report), to Visa. Factors like inking a number of co-brand deals, a strong economy, increasing consumer spending helped aiding the company’s earnings. Other measures such as  businesses streamlining, a curb in expenses, rolling out of new benefits and perks on credit cards and escalating marketing expenditure to win new clients also bolstered the company’s profitability.These strategic moves paid off to some extent, evident from a share price rally of 17% in the past year compared with the  industry’s growth of 1.54%. A couple of days ago, the company announced to launch a co-branded credit card with Amazon.com, targeting small businesses. This reflects its efforts to optimally utilize the immense growth potential in the U.S. small business credit markets.Also, last week, the company got a relief after the Supreme Court ruled in its favor on the anti-trust case around card steering rules. This has allowed American Express to retain the anti-steering clause in its merchant contracts, which prevents  customer diversion to cheaper networks.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

6,AXP,"The S&P 500 financials sector rebounded nearly 1% on Jun 28, breaking its 13-day slump. Shares of all major banks jumped after the Fed announced the results of the final leg of the annual stress-test exercise, known as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The Fed gave an OK to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the United States that hold 80% of the total assets in the U.S. financial system, to raise their dividends and buy back shares.Interestingly, despite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks were widely expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. However, two of Wall Street’s biggest banks, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), failed two of the qualitative stress tests run by the Fed on banks’ capital plans.Consequently, the Fed asked Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to maintain their capital distribution at roughly last year’s level. Moreover, the U.S. arm of Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), failed the stress test, with the Fed rejecting its capital plan.Banks to Pay Higher DividendsMost of the major U.S. banks announced their dividend payout and share buyback plans after results from the second and final of stress test were announced. Despite a few stumbles in the test, the big banks are expected to pay $170 billion in combined dividends for the coming four quarters, as expected by analysts earlier. This is nearly $30 billion more than in the previous 12 months.The country’s four major banks, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo &Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup, Inc. (C  -  Free Report) will offer more than $110 billion through dividends payouts and share buyback. Post stress test results, as many as 20 banks announced their share buyback and dividend payout plans for the next four quarters.Bank Stocks ReboundAlmost a decade after the recession, profits of banks are steadily rising and they are lending more freely. This had made investors hopeful that banks would be paying out higher dividends this time. This saw bank stocks rebounding, with the S&P 500 Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gaining 0.9%.JP Morgan hinted at a 43% increase in its quarterly dividend and buy back of $20.7 billion in shares, while Wells Fargo will increase its quarterly dividend to 43 cents from 39 cents. American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) announced that it will increase its dividend by 11% and buy back $3.4 billion worth of shares.This saw shares of JPMorgan Chase and Well Fargo increase 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup jumped 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. The robust performance by banks stocks saw the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index increasing 0.6% on Thursday. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley FalterThe Fed forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to maintain their capital distribution to roughly last year’s level after the two major lenders failed to pass two important parts of the qualitative stress tests. According to results, both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had higher leverage than Fed’s requirement.However, the banks were given conditional no-objections to their subdued capital plans. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had last week said that they won’t return more than $6.8 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, in capital in the year starting in third quarter.Both banks raised their dividend by 5 cents each. The figures are certainly disappointing, as both banks last week had hinted that they were confident of returning more capital to their shareholders than the figures of regulators suggested. However, shares of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley jumped 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Goldman Sachs has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

8,AXP,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over every single trading session. These losses were primarily attributable to an escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and China.

But industrials continued to be weighed down by the looming trade war.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 0.3% or 4.83 points, after having shed as much as 280 points at one time as investors somewhat shed worries of a United States-China trade war. These fears were triggered by President Trump’s announcement that tariffs would be imposed on Chinese goods worth $50 billion.The new tariffs come into effect from Jul 6. Moreover, Trump said that the United States would impose more import duties if China decides to retaliate by imposing tariffs on U.S. products. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 1.3% and 2%, respectively.The index lost 0.9% over last week.

This is the longest losing streak since Mar 2017. Concerns surrounding a prospective trade war continued to dampen investor sentiment.

11,AXP,"Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most respected investors. He and Berkshire Hathaway  have long favored companies that offer reasonable valuations, mixed with growth opportunities, which sounds simple enough. Here’s a look at some of Berkshire’s top holdings to see if they currently present investors solid value.The last time Berkshire disclosed its holdings it boasted a massive $170 billion stock portfolio. The top five holdings represented roughly 68% of the aggregate fair value. The list featured Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) at $40.7 billion, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) at $25.2 billion, Bank of America (BAC) at $21.0 billion, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) at $17.4 billion, and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) at $14.1 billion. The conglomerate’s other holdings included Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and dozens of other stocks, which they owned much smaller amounts of.So now that we have covered some of Berkshire’s top holdings, let’s take a look at what kind of value Buffett’s top three holdings currently present.Apple Price - Performance/ Valuation Apple is Berkshire’s biggest holding, a spot that is recently took over. In fact, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 the company owned $28.2 billion worth of Apple stock. Therefore, Berkshire bought roughly $12.5 billion worth of shares in a very short amount of time.Shares of Apple have skyrocketed nearly 95% over the last two years, outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 30% surge. Apple stock has also climbed over 14% since the start of the year, which helped it hit a brand new all-time high on Tuesday.Coming into Wednesday, Apple stock was trading at 15.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Apple has traded as high as 17.2X, with a one-year median of 14.9X. Apple stock has also traded as low as 13.2X during this time period, yet investors should note that Apple stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 16.9X. Over the last decade, Apple stock has traded as high as 30.8X. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to say that Apple’s valuation is far from stretched at this time and remains attractive compared to the S&P while remaining relatively in line with its year-long median.Wells Fargo - Price Performance/ Valuation Shares of the embattled banking giant are up just 35% over the last five years, which is far worse the S&P 500’s 71% surge. WFC stock is up 6.6% over the last year but has sunk 8.4% since the start of the year. With that said, Wells Fargo stock currently presents solid value.WFC is trading at 11.3X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to its industry’s 11.4X average—which includes Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and other banking powers.Investors should note that Wells Fargo has traded as high as 15.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 12.4X. Therefore, WFC’s current valuation appears more than fair at the moment.Bank of America - Price Performance/ ValuationBank of America has seen its stock price climb nearly 124% over the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s 71% surge while also beating its industry’s 67% charge. Narrowing the focus a bit more, BAC stock is up over 32% during the last year, nearly doubling its industry’s gains.One might think that these gains would make BAC’s valuation look a little stretch at the moment, but that hardly seems to be the case. Bank of America stock is currently trading at 10.9X, which is just a hair above its year-long low and also represents a discount compared to its year-long median of 12.4X.Investors will note that Bank of America stock is presenting its best value since the fall of 2016. It is also worth pointing out that AAPL, WFC, and BAC are all currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

12,AXP,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains discusses the business of basketball as the NBA Finals, featuring LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers and Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors, heats up. From strong TV ratings during the 2017-18 season to continued social media growth throughout the world, the NBA looks like a league poised to dominate for decades to come.The NBA saw its national television ratings climb during the regular season across the league’s television-network partners, which includes Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, and Turner’s  TNT. Meanwhile, local TV ratings jumped as well on outlets such as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Fox Sports FOXA. This all comes in contrast to the NFL’s ratings declines over the last two years.Viewers and investors should also note that the NBA secured its first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals, with Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube TV featured throughout the broadcast in an array of ways. Going forward, the NBA’s close relationships with the likes of Google and other streaming services could play a huge role in its future success.But it’s not just the NBA’s TV partners benefiting from the league’s growth, the likes of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Goodyear GT, and many more have joined in on the fun. And this comes on top of the major investments American Express AXP, Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) continue to make.Furthermore, Nike NKE looks poised to benefit from its new NBA partnership that might see it remain in business with the league for a long, long time—especially as the likes of Adidas ADDYY and Under Armour UAA become less relevant in the world of basketball.The NBA is already much bigger than nearly every sports league in the world on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). It has also established a strong relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) through multiple Twitch streaming deals, which includes the rights to the league’s brand new esports league it developed with Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Looking ahead, the NBA’s growth in China—through partnerships with Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) and Weibo (WB  -  Free Report)—will be intriguing to follow.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

13,AXP,"The NBA Finals begin Thursday night, with two of the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry, set to face off for the NBA title. But while many will look at how the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors played up to this point, it’s also a great time to check out how some of the NBA’s biggest sponsors performed during the season.Sports Apparel The common thought among many investors is that Curry’s star power hasn’t helped Under Armour UAA stock much over the last year, as it tries to adjust to life as a much bigger company. Curry’s direct impact is debatable, but the company’s stock price has performed rather well since the start of the 2017-18 NBA season in mid-October.Let’s take a look at how it has stacked up against the NBA’s official jersey sponsor and basketball shoe juggernaut, Nike NKE, as well as Adidas ADDYY. Investors will see that despite some of the recent love thrown Adidas’ way, both Nike and Under Armour stock have greatly outperformed the German sports apparel powerhouse since the start of the NBA season. Clearly, there are many other factors impacting these stocks aside from the exposure that the NBA provides, but it is a fun exercise nonetheless.Jersey Sponsors  Nike, which became the official jersey sponsor of the NBA this season, greatly outpaced its two closest rivals. With that said, this season also marked the first time the NBA allowed jersey sponsorship patches. In total, 21 out of the 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with companies paying an average of $6.5 million per year to place their logo on a team’s jersey—worn by both the players and fans.The inaugural jersey patch season saw some major publicly traded companies join in on the NBA’s growing business. This list includes General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Lending Tree (TREE  -  Free Report), Sun Life (SLF  -  Free Report), Ultimate Software (ULTI  -  Free Report), and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report).Clearly, some of the bigger names on the list have all gone through a massively disappointing stretch during their first year as official team jersey sponsors. It’s also worth noting that three out of the four conference finals teams that had a sponsor this year—the Warriors and Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY; the Cavaliers and Goodyear; and the Boston Celtics and GE—all saw their stocks prices fall over 25% since the start of the season.But don’t be surprised if underperforming companies continue their sponsorships as these investments offer a ton of exposure for a relatively small amount of marketing dollars. This becomes even more likely when looking at the NBA’s television ratings, which saw an 8% surge across the league’s four TV-network partners, Disney’s ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV.TV Partners Investors might remember that the NBA is currently benefiting hugely from its nine-year, $24 billion rights deal with ESPN and Turner that runs through the '24-25 season. This is significant money even for these entertainment giants, which means it’s worth taking a look at how ESPN parent Disney and Turner owner Time Warner have performed throughout this season.Biggest Corporate Sponsors Lastly, it is worth taking a look at some of the NBA’s overall corporate partners, which not only advertise heavily but also sponsor the league. Three of the league’s biggest corporate partners are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) via Frito-Lay, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Obviously, all of the companies touched on throughout this article have much larger priorities beyond their affiliation with the NBA. Therefore, none of this stock price movement is a direct reflection on the NBA’s growing business, which saw its overall sponsor revenue surge 31% to $1.12 billion—placing it not too far behind the NFL.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

28,AXP,"American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 18. The performance is likely to reflect gains from its four strategic focus areas — strengthening leadership in the premium consumer segment; extending leadership in commercial payments and in particular with small and medium-sized enterprises; enhancing its digital platform; and strengthening its global integrated network to provide unique value. Results should also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.Revenues in the to-be reported quarter should see an upside from accelerated growth in billings and continued strong growth in loans and fees. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues net of interest expense are expected to be $8.5 billion, up 7.8% year over year.The company has suspended its share buyback program for the first half of 2018, in an effort to build up capital. The bottom line will thus be bereft of the benefit of share buyback.Factors Affecting Q1 ResultsGrowth in Billed Business: The first quarter should reflect an increase in worldwide billed business across its diverse customer segments and geographies. U.S. proprietary consumer and international proprietary consumer billings growth should remain strong. The company saw strong performance from middle market and small business customers, while large and global commercial customers grew at a more modest pace, in the last quarter and the same should be seen in the first quarter. Global Network Services billed business should grow at a slower rate over the year than the proprietary business as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate card billed business is expected to be $275 billion, up 9.1% year over year.Increase in Loan and Recievables: Card Member loan and receivables growth should be seen as the company continues to expand its relationship with existing customers and acquire new Card Members. This should have, however, led to an increase in provisions for losses, lending delinquencies and net write-off rates. The increase in delinquencies and net write-off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time toward non-cobrand lending products, which have higher write-off rates but also drive higher net interest yields.Increase in Total Cards in Force: Total cards in force, which reflects the number of cards that are issued and outstanding, will likely increase in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 116 million up 4.5% year over year.Higher Spending on Card Member Engagement: Spending on rewards, Card Member services and marketing and promotion expenses should show an uptick due to recent enhancements to rewards on the company’s U.S. Platinum products, continued strong growth in its Delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of its premium services. American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise  American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Express is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

29,AXP,"Blockchain is the new buzzword for innovation in the payments industry. Often taken as a synonym for bitcoin, players in the industry are aiming for the blockchain technology given its obvious benefits with regard to speed, accuracy, cost effectiveness, security, and much more.The terms blockchain and bitcoin are widely used interchangeably, but the misconception that blockchain is the technology  underlying the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is changing fast. Though there still remains ambiguity regarding the investment value of the digital currencies which have not yet received broad-based adoption and are often steered clear of, the technology underlying these digital currencies, the blockchain have received a thumbs up in the business world.The Rise of BlockchainAs the name implies, blockchain is a chain of blocks building step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block. The transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and meant to provide unaltered information.Driven by multi-industrial adoption, the technology has rapidly gained traction over the last few years. The solutions offered by other key players in this domain like International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others.There is a huge amount of activity around blockchain technology, and payments is definitely one of the key spaces to watch.Blockchain in Payments IndustryThe attraction of the blockchain technology is hidden in the benefits it provides in three necessary areas of payments   —   speed, cost and security.Highly Secured: One of the main purviews of a payments company is to provide highly secure payments service, and block chain perfectly fits the bill here. Data for transactions taking place via blockchain can be stored with all details such as the transaction amount, a guarantee of payment, confirmation of the payment and account profiles for the parties involved. Data theft on a blockchain becomes highly impossible because if data is changed on one node, every other node would have to reflect that change for it to take effect. Since blockchain uses a distributed consensus, tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult. This makes the system extremely safe.With minimum chances of double counting and hacking, the possibility of monetary losses is low via cybercrime. With increasing instances of cybercrime, which per a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures is expected to cost global businesses over $6 trillion by 2021, this secured ledger-based technology is bound to gain further importance.Cost Effective: Players are looking forward to blockchain for a solution to address high cost associated with the payments process under the present scenario, which involves costly, time-consuming, paper-based manual process. At present, fees have to be paid to various parties involved in payment processing and at times there are other fees at various other stages of the transaction. All these costs get elimination under blockchain since it nullifies the involvement of a third party in transaction processing, which pulls down overall costs.Speed Enhancement: At present cross border payments are carried out through correspondent banks and not via a central clearing house, which lengthens the whole process, along with making it inefficient. Demand for speedier and efficient service makes blockchain technology the perfect fit here. On a blockchain-based payment, gateway payments can be sent anywhere around the world in 15 to 20 seconds by eliminating intermediaries and using algorithms to verify and authorize payments instantly. This can shorten the whole process which under traditional model takes up to three days, thereby reducing the overall wait time for transaction processing.In Kenya, BitPesa is using the blockchain method to enable companies to make faster, cheaper payments between African countries without having to rely on slow and inefficient local banking infrastructure, according to a Citi Research report.Adoption by CarriersThe blockchain technology is being adopted by industry players with arms wide open.It was recently reported that Ripple, the U.S. digital payments company, is working with 61 Japanese banks to apply blockchain technology for efficient cash transfers.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) launched its own blockchain network last year to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company’s existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows – account-based, blockchain-based and card-based.The company recently joined Enterprise Etherum Alliance to explore the potential of the etherum technolohy across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard’s traditional payments environment.  Another major company Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) has recently launched Visa B2B Connect, a payment platform powered by the blockchain technology. Via this platform, Visa will offer its services using 23 fiat currencies and 4 partner banks including Commerce Bank in the US, Shinhan Bank in South Korea, Sberbank in Russia and United Overseas Bank in Singapore.Last year, American Express Inc. (AXP  -  Free Report) inked a deal to use the blockchain technology to pay U.K. customers who bank with Santander. Recently, CoinDesk reported that the company has filed a patent related to blockchain. Reports noted that the company’s filing emphasized the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Still a Long Way to GoGiven the fact that the technology is still in its nascent stages, there remains difficulty in understanding its functionality and applicability. It may thus take a few years before it becomes widely accepted. It is nonetheless a fact that blockchain is the forthcoming reality which would be transformational for the payments industry. We therefore expect to see increased activity on this front, going forward.Among the companies mentioned (in the payments industry) above, Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Mastercard and American Express each sport a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

30,AXP,"Mastercard Incorported (MA  -  Free Report), essentially a technology company, is fast incorporating the blockchain technology into its operations. The company is going a step further by trying this novel technology after having made massive investments in its digital platform  over past many years. The need for the same is driven by changing trends in the digital economy, which calls for faster payments via electronic means.The company was the front runner in the adoption of this technology by announcing its blockchain API in 2016. Blockchain is the technology underlying the cryprocurrencies. As the name implies, it is a chain of blocks which gets built step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block, the transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.Though this technology is still in its nascent stage and its full potential remains yet to be harnessed, it is widely believed to be a game changer. The benefits of blockchain cannot be undermined in the payments space given the speed, flexibility, security and cost effectiveness it provides to the transactions.Last year, Mastercard launched its own blockchain network to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. Mastercard intends to take advantage of the blockchain technology and the Mastercard Settlement Network to transfer funds between bank accounts. The Mastercard Settlement Network reads the blockchain and will transfer the funds between two banks. It then writes a confirmation of transfer to the Mastercard blockchain.The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company’s existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows — account-based, blockchain-based and card-based. The company is, however, not using the digital currency but keeping its transaction base in fiat currency.The company recently joined Enterprise Etherum Alliance, an open source block-chain consortium, to explore the potential of the etherum technology across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard’s traditional payments environment.  Year to date, Mastercard’s stock has gained 65% significantly, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%.Another company in the same space, Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), is working on the blockchain technology. American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) last November, joined blockchain network RippleNet to explore the use of this technology for faster, more efficient B2B payments. Recently, The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released the patent application filed by American Express Travel Related Services Company, the payment technology firm’s travel unit, which outlines the use of blockchain technology to accelerate payments between two parties. Its application emphasizes the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another player worth considering from in the same space is Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), which carries the same Zacks Rank as Mastercard and surpassed earnings expectation in each of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 4%.

31,AXP,"The stock of MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) fell out of favor with investors. This is to a large extent corroborated by its share price movement that suffered from a number of reasons ranging from the blockage of its merger with Ant Financial, weakness in its money transfer business, which accounts for a major chunk of the company’s revenues, increased compliance costs as well as ever-increasing competition in the dynamic money transfer industry.The stock of the money transfer company has lost 44% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6%. This performance looks grave when compared with other superior players’ performance.To put this into perspective, shares of Virtu Financial, Inc. (VIRT  -  Free Report) grew 110% while Houlihan Lokey, Inc. (HLI  -  Free Report) and Ameican Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) grew 47% and 22%, respectively, over the same time frame. What’s Dragging the Stock?The stock seems to be suffering from industry-wide as well as company-specific headwinds. Industry headwinds include – growing competition from a number of players entering the industry; increase in the number of ways money is being remitted across the globe; heightened regulation as governments across the globe is seeking to crack down and check fraudulent money transfers; economic and political unrest in some parts of the globe and foreign exchange volatility.While these factors should have adversely impacted the shares of its ilk, that is not the case here. Therefore, it seems that the company continues to reel under its own headwinds. These are:Failed Merger With Ant Financial: MoneyGram’s merger with Ant Financial Services Group was called off after the regulators showed a red flag to the deal. The partnership with Ant Financial would have strengthened Moneygram, which operates in an intensively competitive and fast-changing payments industry. On its own now, the company will have to continually invest in businesses to keep pace with its peers.Pricing Pressure: Pricing pressure continues to impact negatively on company’s growth in the U.S. to U.S. channel as well as the economic issues in the Middle East and Africa, which have restricted its ability to transact in certain markets. These trends are expected to put pressure on revenues in 2018. We note that revenues have declined from 2013-2015. After a hiatus in 2016, it dipped again in 2017. This lackluster revenue performance must have dragged its share price.Increased Compliance Cost: MoneyGram also faces compliance risks associated with regulations, governing its business and cost structure in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. Such factors further restrict its ability to invest in new remittance technologies, posing threats to its long-term competitive and operating leverage. From 2014-2016, the company incurred nearly $43 million (on average) in its compliance enhancement program. In 2017, the compliance enhancement program cost the company $28 million. Such high compliance would drain its bottom line when its top-line growth is already suffering.Weakness in Certain Markets: In Saudi Arabia, the company continues to see a slowdown in transactions and revenues due to economic challenges which have resulted in lower remittance volumes. Economic issues in the Middle East and Africa have restricted its ability to transact in certain markets. Though the company has been closely watching these countries, given the complexities of the issues, it does not expect the situation to improve in near future. Also, new central bank capital controls in Nigeria were recently implemented, restricting sends to 50% of received volume. This occurred when the company was growing rapidly in Nigeria. These regulations are currently inhibiting the company’s business in this country.Can the Stock Turn Around?We do not expect any respite in the near term as economic issues in the Middle East and Africa is expected to continue. Though the company has been closely watching these countries, given the complexities of the issues, it does not expect the situation to improve in near future.Also, the company is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti-fraud and anti-money laundering program during 2003 to early 2009, among many other government investigations and litigations. Any reverse result from the investigation will indicate a potential liability for damages, which could put pressure on margins and cash flow.The company is compelled to make continuous investments in growing its digital platform to stay ahead in the industry that is witnessing increased percolation of technology. These investments might exert pressure on the bottom line.We have a little visibility of the company’s earnings performance for the coming quarters and therefore we choose to remain on the sidelines.MoneyGram carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

33,AXP,"The American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) is likely to get a breather from the senate’s recent decision to bring in a few amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulations and policies extensively control the company, TRS and its U.S. bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank).The Dodd-Frank Reform was put in place by President Obama in 2010 to prevent the reccurence of the 2008 financial crisis.Amendment to the ActOne of the main tenet of the senate’s banking bill is to raise the minimium threshold bar for institutions that are deemed too big to fail to $250 billion  from $50 billion. This change would bring a relive to the small institutions and will result in a reduction in the number of banking institutions considered “too big to fail.” Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.Some of the beneficiaries of change are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) among others.American Express to Gain from the MoveIf the proposed changes see the light of the day, American Express will no longer have to undergo the annual stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. These tests are designed to evaluate whether the company in question has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to recuperate losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions.The company is now required to maintain capital ratios appreciably above the applicable minimum requirements and buffers. It is also restricted in its ability to make any capital distributions (including dividend and share buy backs). A relaxation of this rule will provide the company increased financial flexibility and greater autonomy in capital allocation.We believe the company will be able to divert buffer capital for business expansion and enhance products.Strong Economy Another BoonLow unemployment, strong consumer confidence and reduction in tax rates bodes well for the company’s business which is directly dependent on consumer spending. The company has witnessed an increase in top line, thanks to increased spending.Lower Tax Rate to Benefit American ExpressA lower tax rate from the tax reform has enabled the company to plan to invest up to $200 million in 2018, for growth. For shareholders, the company expects to use the anticipated benefits to build capital and drive earnings in 2018.The operating environment looks favorable for American Express which in the recent past suffered from loss of one of its biggest client Costco Wholesale Corp. The company thereafter undertook massive growth initiatives which included increased marketing and advertising, higher customer rewards, and investment in customer-facing activities increased frills on cards etc. to woo and retain customers.The tearing away of the stiff capital regulations will further provide an impetus to its business.Shares of the company have gained around 21% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 5% rally.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

34,AXP,"On Mar 14, the Senate passed a crucial Bill easing several of the regulations, which were put in place to guard against a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The proposed legislation loosens norms mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which were put in place after the crisis led to many Americans losing their homes and jobs.The major beneficiaries of the new legislation appear to be regional banks, smaller community banks, regional lending institutions and credit unions. Though larger banks also received crucial reprieves, these were minor compared to the relief received by their smaller counterparts.The legislation now faces a crucial test in the House of Representatives, but given the bipartisan support it has received, smaller banks can expect easing up of regulations going forward. With rates set to rise and economic growth looking strong, investing in these banks looks like a smart option at this point. Regional Banks Receive ReprieveThe Senate’s banking Bill aims to raise the threshold for banks which are deemed too big to fail. This limit, currently set at $50 billion in terms of assets, will now be raised to $250 billion. This implies that only the largest U.S. banks would have to abide by the most stringent regulations stipulated by the Federal Reserve.This means that several midsized banks would no longer have to submit “living will” regulations which elaborately specify how banks intend to safely dispose of its assets in case of a failure.  Also, they would no longer have to undergo Federal Reserve stress tests on an annual basis.The beneficiaries of this clause include household names such as BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report).Major Relief for Community BanksOther major beneficiaries of the proposed law are smaller community banks and credit unions. Banks of this nature with less than $10 billion in assets will no longer have to comply with the Volcker Rule. This regulation prevents financial institutions from engaging in speculative trading. It was put in place to stop such banks from selling risky mortgages and to ensure that they could withstand difficult business conditions.Smaller banks have complained for some time that they were subject to rules which were targeted primarily at bigger financial players. A more contentious reprieve intends to reduce reporting requirements for mortgage data. Additionally, smaller banks would no longer have to comply with strict mortgage underwriting norms put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act.This rule was intended to determine whether banks were giving loans only to these individuals who had the ability to pay back these amounts. However, smaller banks have long complained that they find it difficult to comply with such regulations. The Bill’s supporters argue that the relaxation of these clauses will enable easier disbursal of mortgages and business loans, especially in rural areas.Our ChoicesThe Senate’s new bipartisan legislation significantly eases norms for mid-sized and smaller banks. While their ease of doing business will increase substantially if the new law is implemented, compliance related costs will likely decline.A stronger rate environment and an encouraging economic backdrop are already proving to be beneficial for banks. Given that regulatory restrictions are also likely to ease up in the near term, it makes sense to invest in smaller banks at this time.

This need, necessitated by economic and technological progress, rising middle-class population, contactless technology and mobile computing, is shaping commerce globally and accelerating the migration from cash to digital payments.The shift in form of payments is corroborated by the fact that last year global digital payment volume exceeded cash for the first time in history. Visa, by virtue of its vast and ongoing investments in technological innovations, is well-positioned to continue leading this digital transformation.This leading network provider and payment processor has come a long way with its technological transformation initiatives, undertaken in 2015.  Most noteworthy was the launch of Visa’s Developer Platform (VDP) in fiscal 2016. The VDP was developed based on demands of consumers and merchants, who increasingly rely on connected devices to shop, pay and get paid.Visa’s digital products include Visa Checkout, Visa Direct and Visa Token Service.Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online and mobile transactions. Visa Direct is its real-time “push” payments platform that allows businesses, governments and consumers to use the network to transfer funds from an originating account to another via a debit, prepaid or credit card number, where Visa Token Service allows transactions using a token. Tokenization helps to protect consumer financial information and lessen the risk of stolen card credentials, particularly when information regarding a financial instrument is stored on a mobile phone or wearable device or is stored on an e-commerce platform.The company is also partnering with Fintech companies with exciting capabilities, which is expected to add value to the payment system. In this vein, the company has partnered with Klarna, which offers online acceptance and consumer lending in Europe. It also collaborated with Marqeta, a card issuing, processing and program management service that allows businesses to authorize transactions and fund payment cards. The company also signed a pact with PayPal that allows cardholders to choose Visa as a preferred payment method.Visa is accelerating into Internet-of-Things (IoT) payments. The company is also in the process of using blockchain technology to provide a new way to consumers, businesses and banks to transact. It is the key strategy to provide payment solutions that will meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers.Visa’s technological investments have borne fruits by increasing payment volumes led by higher processed transactions.

38,AXP,"The Sage of Omaha published his annual letter on Feb 24. He remained bullish on U.S. stocks over the long term. After all, stocks have performed better than bonds in the long run. Inflationary pressure is also brewing looming concern. This will affect bonds more than stocks because of their lower returns.Corporate America, in the meantime, has received a massive permanent tax break, which will further boost profits. Changes to the tax law has already provided the much-needed windfall to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-B, whose market value rose 21.9% in 2017, edging past the S&P 500’s return of 21.8%.Given the positives, investing in Berkshire’s largest stock holdings seems judicious. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time.Buffett’s Annual Letter to Shareholders: Stay Invested in StocksWorld’s third richest man, Warren Buffett, urged investors to ignore gyrations in the equity market, guidance from market pundits with fancy credentials and resist the temptation to scoop up bonds. He added that investors with long-term goals like pension funds and savings-minded individuals will make a “terrible mistake” if they measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks.As the investor’s investment horizon increases a diversified portfolio of equities do better than bonds. Lest we forget, the S&P 500 that mirrors a huge cross-section of American businesses has returned an average of 10% per year, while long-term government bonds have returned 5% to 6%.Treasury Yields RiseTreasury yields are scaling record highs after a significant rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Federal Reserve will hike rates more times than anticipated.The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Several states have also raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Rise in bond yields, in the meantime, might tempt investors to take money away from equities and invest in bonds. But, Buffett cautioned that long-term bonds tend to generate less return than stocks and with rising inflation, bonds can really become a dumb investment. Needless to say, rising inflation erodes the value of the principal on fixed income securities.Buffet Thanks New Tax Code for Big GainsBuffett told investors that Berkshire got a lift from the new tax code. He wrote that Berkshire made a $65.3 billion net gain in 2017, which increased the per-share book value of both Class A and Class B stock by 23%. However, only $36 billion came from the company’s operations. The rest came from the new U.S. tax code, which slashed corporate taxes and in turn boosted profit margins.The House of Representatives passed the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).5 of Berkshire’s Largest Stock Holdings to Buy NowAs mentioned above, business magnate Warren Buffet prefers investing in stocks rather than bonds.

39,AXP,"LendingClub Corporation (LC  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 1 cent, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. However, the figure compares favorably with the prior-year quarter’s loss of 2 cents.The results largely benefited from top-line growth and rise in loan originations. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) showed impressive growth. However, a decline in loan balance and escalating expenses were the major headwinds.Results for the reported quarter included several significant items. Including these, consolidated net loss was $92.1 million compared with net loss of $32.3 million in the year-ago quarter.For 2017, the company reported nil adjusted earnings per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent but compares favorably with the prior-year’s loss of 10 cents. Consolidated net loss was $154 million compared with $146 million in 2016.Revenues & Costs RiseTotal net revenues increased 19.9% year over year to $156.5 million. The rise was primarily due to higher volume of loan originations. However, the figure marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $157.2 million.For 2017, net revenues of $574.5 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $575.3 million. The figure jumped 14.7% year over year.Total operating expenses came in at $247.8 million, reflecting a considerable rise of 52% from the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to a class action litigation settlement of $77 million.Adjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million against adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $0.9 million in the prior-year quarter.In the reported quarter, loan originations were $2.4 billion, up 22.7% from the year-ago quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $402 million, down 22% from the prior quarter. Loans were down 14% sequentially to $2.9 billion.

40,AXP,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.1% in that time frame underperforming the market in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AXP due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.American Express Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates American Express Company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.6%. Earnings witnessed a sharp 74% year-over-year improvement.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by growth in card billed business, increase in total cards in force, higher Card Member spending at lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics, plus lower operating costs.The Tax ReformThe company saddled a charge of $2.6 billion on account of estimated taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings. The remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities led to net loss of $1.41 per share compared with net income 88 cents per share a year ago.This charge has drained American Express’ capital ratio. In order to rebuild the same, the company has put on hold its share buyback plan until the first half of 2018, but has promised to continue paying dividend at the current level.Over the long haul the company, however, is sanguine about the tax reform and stated that it would invest up to $200 million more in 2018 than originally planned for customer-facing growth initiatives. It also plans to use the anticipated benefits from tax savings to provide more for its employees and shareholders.Full-Year 2017 ResultsEarnings per share were $2.97, down 47% year over year. Sans the impact of the Tax Act, earnings per share were $5.87. The company delivered better than its own expectations. It was in line with the guidance the company offered during its last results (earnings per share of $5.80 to $5.90) and higher than the initial guidance provided at the beginning of the year ($5.60 to $5.80).Revenues, net of interest expense, for the full year were $33.5 billion, up 4% year over year, driven by record billings and strong loan growth.Delving DeeperRevenues came in at $8.84 billion, 1.4% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.72 billion. Top line increased 10% year over year on higher non-interest income and interest received on loans.Provisions for losses totaled $833 million, up 33% year over year attributable to growth in the loan portfolio and an escalation in the lending write-off and delinquency rates.Total expenses of $6.2 billion decreased 1% year over year due to a decline in marketing cost, partly offset by higher rewards’ expenses.The effective tax rate was 24%, reflecting a fall from 29% in the year-ago quarter. The tax rate decrease primarily reflected the level and geographic mix of earnings as well as discrete tax items.Total expenses fell 1% year over year to $6.2 billion, primarily due to lower marketing and promotion and professional services expenses.Segment ResultsAmerican Express’ U.S. Consumer Services segment reported net income of $507 million, up 44% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expense of $3.4 billion, was up 13% year over year, reflecting higher net interest income and Card Member spending.International Consumer and Network Services’ net income amounted to $199 million, up 137% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, climbed 7% (on a currency adjusted basis) year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily on the back of higher Card Member spending.Global Commercial Services’ net income of $580 million rose a good 52% year over year. Total revenues, net of interest expenses, increased 7% year over year to $2.7 billion, primarily reflecting higher Card Member spending.Global Merchant Services’ net income rose 12% year over year to $413 million in the reported quarter. Total revenues, net of interest expenses, increased 9% year over year to $1.2 billion on higher Card Member spending, partially offset by a lower discount rate.Corporate and Other reported net loss of $2.9 billion, which compared unfavorably with the net loss of $361 million in the year-ago quarter.2018 GuidanceThe company foresees 2018 earnings per share between $6.90 and $7.30.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.American Express Company Price and Consensus  American Express Company Price and Consensus | American Express Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AXP has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

Further, the CBOE Volatility Index surged once again after declining for two straight sessions. Meanwhile, market watchers speculated a possible government shutdown would ensue if the budget deal is not passed by the Senate. Finally, the initial jobless claims hit a 45-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46. However, the S&P 500 fell 3.8% to close at 2,581. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 6,777.16, losing 3.9%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 14.5% to close at 31.76.A total of around 10.6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.2 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by an 8.26 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 5.58-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets in Correction, Major Stocks Pull BackThe Dow suffered severe losses after plummeting as much as 1,033 points on Thursday. This is the blue-chip index’s second decline by over 1,000 points during this week. Such a dip also led the Dow to finish 10.4% off its record close on Jan 26, 2018, charting its second-biggest decline in terms of points since its inception.Also, this marked its third decline by more than 500 points in a matter of five days. The blue-chip index finished at its lowest level since Nov 28, 2017 and is set to post its worst weekly decline since October 2008. Despite these losses, the Dow still managed to finish above its lowest close for the week of 23,778.74 that it hit on Tuesday.Losses for the Dow were broad based. Shares of American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined 5.6%, 5.4% and 4.4%, respectively, contributing majorly to the Dow’s losses.The S&P 500 bled 100.7 points to end in negative territory, finishing 10.2% off its all-time high.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Broader markets suffered huge losses on Thursday following concerns over increasing market volatility, a possible surge in inflation which might lead to a rate hike and an increase in bond yields. Analysts also stated that this correction was just a pullback from massive gains scored for the major part of 2017 and the first month of 2018. Market watchers also speculated a government shutdown would come about if the Senators do not pass the budget deal by midnight.CBOE VIX Rears its Ugly Head AgainHaving fallen for two consecutive sessions, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged almost 24% in intraday trade to 34.48. However, the fear gauge mellowed down to 14.5% by the end of the session. The index of market uncertainty has shown severe fluctuations over the week, highlighting the frenzy that market watchers have gone through over this period. Such panic has arisen primarily out of speculations regarding a hike in inflation even as the economy has been burgeoning.Possibility of Partial Federal ShutdownLeaders from Congress announced on Wednesday that they had agreed upon a two-year budget deal to end the uncertainty regarding government spending and immigration laws. Such tensions had led to a government shutdown earlier in the month. Agreement on the budget legislation came months after both Republicans and Democrats tried to reach a consensus on the deal.The deal seeks to increase federal spending by $300 billion over the next two years. This would exceed the ceiling that was imposed by in 2011. The deal increases military spending by $80 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year through September and further by $85 billion in fiscal 2019. This comes over and above the emerging war funds of about $140 billion.The new agreement also seeks to extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program by 10 years and spare another $80 billion for disaster relief funding. Moreover, the legislation also beefs up non-defense spending by $63 billion for this year and by $68 billion for 2019.The future of the deal is uncertain as it requires the support from the Democrats, who are expected to out rightly oppose any surge in government spending. Further, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants a vote in favor of the protection of undocumented immigrants termed as ‘Dreamers’, in return for voting in favor of the budget spending. This issue has gone unaddressed in the $300 billion deal. Finally, if the deal is not passed by the midnight, the U.S. is headed for another partial federal shutdown.Jobless Claims near a 45-Year LowInitial jobless claims for the last week came in at 221,000 as opposed to 230,000 for the previous period. The consensus estimate for the current period was 233,000. The monthly average of the jobless claims plummeted 10,000 to 224,500 on Thursday. This marks its lowest level since March 1973.Stocks That Made HeadlinesViacom Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Decrease Y/YViacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017), wherein earnings per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

46,AXP,"Markets closed mostly lower after a decline in tech stocks following a dip in the shares of Apple. Also weighing on broader markets were Wilbur Ross’ and Steve Mnuchin’s comments at Davos. However, the Dow managed to post a record close after assistance from financial stocks. Meanwhile, the existing home sales for December came in below expected.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased less than 0.2%, to close at 26,252.12.

On Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Dow Manages Gains on a Tough DayEarlier in the session, a surge in industrial stocks boosted the Dow. Shares of industrial behemoths like General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) all shot up. Caterpillar, in particular, gained after it witnessed an increase in its monthly machine retail sales. However, shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined by as much as 1.6% and weighed heavily on the blue-chip index. Also, comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin weighed on the Dow.Wilbur Ross commented on Wednesday that United States was prepared for a trade war with China if the need arises. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, Ross stated: “So trade wars have been in place for quite a little while; the difference is the US troops are now coming to the ramparts.” Ross also blamed China for hiding its practice of trade protectionism under the veil of free trade.Even more noteworthy comments were heard from his colleague U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said the Trump administration favored “bilateral trade agreements.”’ Mnuchin added that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling below the 90 mark for the first time since Dec 2014.Further, the Trump administration imposed high tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday. Such protectionist policies weighed on the greenback and broader markets.Finally, the Dow managed to gain 41.3 points and finished at a fresh record. Gains for the blue-chip index were supported by a surge in financial stocks. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) surged 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively and led the Dow higher, offsetting the losses incurred earlier.

Also weighing on the broader index was a decline in shares of Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet, which lost 1.5%, 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively.Meanwhile, S&P 500 lost 1.6 points to end in negative territory, followed by a dip in tech stocks. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, six ended in the red, with tech and utilities leading the laggards. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) and Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) declined 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Such broad based losses for the tech stocks also weighed on the tech-laden index, Nasdaq, which shed 45.2 points to close in the red.Economic DataOn the economic data front, the U.S. flash services PMI, released by IHS Markit declined to 53.3 this month. On the other hand, the flash manufacturing PMI surged to 55.5 in the same period.Meanwhile, existing home sales for the month of December 2017 increased to 5.57 million units, below the consensus estimate of an increase of 5.69 million units. The reported value for the previous month was 5.78 million units. Such a dismal performance was due to a decline of 11.4% in the inventory for the month of December.Stocks That Made HeadlinesXilinx Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Stock UpShares of Xilinx Inc.

48,AXP,"In the Global Week Ahead, I see five veins to mine -- for insights into the future direction -- of these highly valued, momentum trading global equity markets.We haven’t yet felt a new tone in 2018, at least one that is fundamentally different from the heady, low volatile markets of 2017.Hitting on multiple fronts, that heady bullish tone faces its first major challenges.(1) This will be a big week for earnings. The U.S. S&P 500 Q4 season kicks into higher gear and broadens out. Eighty-nine firms listed on the S&P 500 release results. This includes names like Netflix, State Street, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, GE, Ford, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar, Intel, Starbucks, 3M, Colgate-Palmolive and Lockheed Martin. Certain reports will be parsed for guidance on critical macro outlooks, such as capital spending (Caterpillar), demand for autos (Ford) and other consumer products (Procter & Gamble). (2) What comes out of Davos’ World Economic Forum? The annual World Economic Forum meeting starts on Tuesday and goes through Friday.India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi will kick it off with the opening address and U.S. President Trump should get in the final word in the closing keynote address, barring a shutdown cancellation. The leaders of Canada, France, the U.K. and Italy plus E.U. President Juncker will be there; along with top party officials from China -- but not President Xi Jinping, who dominated attention last year. Leaders from emerging/developing/rising markets will be represented. Brazil’s President Temer and Argentina’s Macri will be there. The heads and top officials from international organizations like the IMF, World Bank, the UN and World Trade Organization will be there, too. (3) On Tuesday, NAFTA talks kick off again, after a long hiatus -- in Montreal, Canada.Even without an agreement in the budget standoff, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said last Friday the United States will participate in the NAFTA negotiations as scheduled. While progress has been made on updating the 25-year-old agreement, earlier trade talks between the three longtime trading partners have been fraught with tension. The United States has slapped heavy penalties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber -- over what it calls unfair trade practices -- such as subsidies. Canada has filed a broad case with the World Trade Organization -- over those and other tariffs the U.S. has levied -- against Ottawa and other countries. (4) A number of central banks meet. Though little action is expected, keep a close eye on the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank leaders' actions. They and other central bankers must weigh strengthening global growth against the probability of more U.S. rates hikes. There will be plenty of scrutiny on these dialogues by stock and bond traders alike.(5) Reuters wrote to us about an already tightening bond market backdrop. “The hits just kept on coming for bond markets last week. First, it was a tweak in the Bank of Japan’s purchases of Japanese government bonds which pushed yields higher and then it was a report of a possible scaling back of U.S. Treasury purchases by China, rounded off by speculation over possible policy tweaks from the European Central Bank and finally better-than-expected U.S. inflation data.”Higher long-term rates could be the bane of rising global stock markets!Top Zacks Rank Stock Picks—Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report): This Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) is a big integrated oil & gas firm. With global oil prices on the rise, this stock could be a great Energy Sector pick. The long-term Zacks VGM score is B.American Express (AXP  -  Free Report): This is the venerable U.S. based credit card firm. The stock now has $85 billion in market capitalization. The long-term Zacks VGM score is B. Despite its Zacks #1 Rank, AMEX is becoming a contrarian call. In last week’s earnings reports, the big four U.S. retail banks sustained a near -20% jump in losses from credit cards in 2017, raising doubts about the ability of consumers to fuel economic expansion.Sony Corp (SNE  -  Free Report): A Zacks #1 Rank sticks around. This is the audio-video giant based in Japan. The long-term Zacks VGM score is A. Savvy global traders play the momentum roll underway on major Japanese stocks. So should you.Key Global Macro—On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan’s policy decisions will be carefully scrutinized for evidence of where the balance lies between early exit talk versus accelerated bond purchasing tactics. On Thursday, the ECB could signal policy tapering on its “QE” program, while leaving its heterodox rates policy unchanged. On Friday, the main — perhaps only — piece of U.S. macro fundamental risk lands. That would be the preliminary GDP reading.U.S. Q4 real GDP growth could be a “3-handle” for the third consecutive quarter. Regional Fed District Banks have weighed in with ‘NowCast’ estimates that range from +3.1 to +3.9%. Bloomberg consensus looks for growth at +2.7%. Financial Times consensus is at +2.8%.On Monday, the Bank of Japan holds a monetary policy meeting. The overnight rate is still -0.10%.The unemployment rate in Taiwan is 3.69%. A new reading comes out.On Tuesday, the important German ZEW indexes come out. German Current Conditions should go from 89.3 to 88, Eurozone Current Conditions from 50.7 to 51.Brazil’s IBGE inflation rate comes out. It should go from 2.94% to 3.11%. Note: this low a Brazil consumer inflation rate is an achievement.An appeals court also starts the trail of former Brazilian President Lula da Silva.On Wednesday, France’s composite PMI index comes out. It was high at 59.4. In comparison, the Eurozone composite PMI may go from 58.1 to 58.4. Numbers near 60 are great expansionary readings.Mexico’s bi-weekly CPI reading should fall from 6.85% to 5.68%. Perhaps this is the weakening peso driving import costs up? NAFTA stress is apparent, nonetheless.The U.S. manufacturing PMI comes out. It was 55.1. Not as strong as Europe, but still strong.On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) head Mario Draghi holds a press conference, after issuing new rate decisions.The IFO indexes for Germany come out. Business Climate should go from 117.2 to 117. Current Conditions should go from 125.4 to 125.8, and Expectations from 109.5 to 110. Those are mostly improvements from already high readings.The Norges Bank (aka Central Bank of Norway) also issues a new interest rate decision. Notably, its current policy rate is very low at 0.50%. That goes to show you. Until the ECB ends QE, the rest of Europe’s central banks are stuck.The Russian unemployment rate is 5.1%.U.S. initial claims last week were super-low at 220K. This week, we get a fresh reading, with added noise from the possible gov’t shutdown not yet included.On Friday, the U.K.’s latest GDP reading comes out. The last one was +1.7% y/y.U.S. durable goods orders come out, along with a first reading of Q4 GDP. Forecasts complied into a Financial Times Q4 GDP consensus sits at +2.8%, down from Q3 data at +3.2%.

49,AXP,"Markets ended higher on Friday after expectations of strong corporate earnings overshadowed tensions related to a possible government shutdown. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closes. The Dow also ended in the green due to broad based gains. Meanwhile, Mick Mulvaney commented that the likelihood of a government shutdown was around 50%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.2% to close at 26,071.72. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close at 2,810.30. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,336.38, gaining 0.6%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 5.6% to close at 11.54. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,423 to 1,122. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered the declining ones by 1,397 to 1,063.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S&P 500 amassed 12.3 points to finish at an all-time record, also hitting an intraday high earlier in the session. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, nine ended in the positive territory, with consumer staples and consumer discretionary segments leading the gainers. The Consumer Discret Sel Sect SPDR ETF (XLY) rose 0.9%, whereas, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) gained 1.1%.This marks another feat that the broader index achieved — not declining by more than 5% for 395 consecutive sessions. Previously, the S&P 500 had gone without declining more than 5% for 394 sessions between 1994 and 1996.The Nasdaq gained 40.3 points to also close at a record, hitting an intraday high earlier. Gains for the tech-laden index were rather broad-based. Broader markets gained on Friday on optimism over economic growth and expectations of stupendous corporate earnings.Meanwhile, the Dow pared earlier losses to climb 53.9 points on Friday. The blue-chip index came within half a percentage point of a record finish. However, a dip in the shares of IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) weighed on the blue-chip index. Shares of IBM declined 4% after the company reported that high tax rates in 2018 would weigh on its profits. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, shares of American Express declined 1.8% after posting its first quarterly loss in as many as 26 years. The credit card giant posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.19 billion, or $1.41 per share. The loss was due in large part to its previously disclosed charge related to the new GOP tax plan of $2.6 billion. (Read More)Mulvaney Says 50% Odds of a Government ShutdownChief of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney commented on Friday that chances of a complete government shutdown could be 50-50. In an interview to CNBC he also said, ""We were operating under sort of a 30 percent shutdown up until yesterday. I think we're ratcheting it up now.""On Thursday, the House passed a one-month spending Bill to keep the government funded up until Feb 16, 2018. However, the bill did not find much favor in the Senate and therefore could not reach the 60-vote mark to clear the Senate. The Senate adjourned without further voting for a final outcome on Thursday.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 1%, 0.9% and 1%, respectively. All the three major benchmarks posted their third week of gains on the trot. The Republican tax Bill last year, now known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was passed by the House for the second time after Senate Republicans passed the tax overhaul Bill, excluding certain provisions.  The Senate voted 51-48 in favor of the Bill, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentiment. Sectors like real estate and utilities, which are considered as alternatives to bonds, declined after yield on 10-year Treasury notes reached its highest level since 2014.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUpcoming Consumer Earnings Reports to Watch: JNJ, F, SBUXFourth-quarter earnings season is finally underway, and investors are already getting excited about the upcoming reports from market-moving tech companies like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report).

This has become possible following easing political tensions between the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region and the federal government of Iraq. The company had called off operations in the region in October 2017 owing to increasing disputes.Post the Kurdistan independence referendum (September 2017), which was strongly opposed by the Iraqi government, the latter seized the oil fields in Kirkuk and Kirdustani regions. The move reduced the revenues of the region to half owing to the loss of over 350,000 barrels of oil production per day, raising supply concerns in the region.However, with the dispute abating of late, Zacks Rank #3 Chevron has started to take necessary steps to remobilize staff and equipment in the region to recommence operations at the Sarta 3 block in Kurdistan.Chevron is the chief operator of the block holding 80% interest in the Sarta product-sharing contract (PSC).

Earnings witnessed a sharp 74% year-over-year improvement.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by growth in card billed business, increase in total cards in force, higher Card Member spending at lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics, plus lower operating costs.The Tax ReformThe company saddled a charge of $2.6 billion on account of estimated taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings.

The company is a Zacks Rank 1 (Strong Buy), and have a Value, Growth, and Momentum score of B.Dave will look at American Express’s past earnings, take a look at what is currently going on with the company, and give us his thoughts on their upcoming earnings announcement.Furthermore, Dave will uncover some potential options trades for investors looking to make a play on American Express ahead of earnings.American Express in FocusAmerican Express Company, together with its subsidiaries, provides charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services to consumers and businesses worldwide.

55,AXP,"American Express Co.’s (AXP  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings should see a drag from the recent corporate tax reform, which has been slashed to 21% from 35%. Consequently, the company would see nearly $2.4 billion charges in the to-be-reported quarter on account of write-down in deferred tax assets (DTAs) and a one-time tax on the company’s unrepatriated overseas earnings.This one-time charge will push American Express to a loss in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the company expects 2017 earnings to fall short of its guided range of $5.80-$5.90 per share.Q4 Earnings DriversIncrease in Net Revenues: We expect the company’s fourth-quarter revenues net of interest expense to increase on the back of strong growth in billed business and an increase in net interest income.  Net interest yield is expected to increase year over year primarily related to a shift in mix toward non-cobrand lending products that generally attract more revolving loan balances, a lower percentage of total loans at introductory interest rates, specific pricing actions and a benefit from increases in benchmark interest rates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues net of interest expense is $8.8 billion, up from $8.4 billion reported in the previous quarter.Higher Total Cards in Force: Total cards in force represent the total number of charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding, and accepted on the company’s network. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total cards in force is 115 million, up 4.5% year over year.Increase in Card Member Loan: Card Member loan and receivables growth is expected to be strong year over year, as the company continues to expand its relationships with existing customers and acquire new Card Members.Share Buyback: In addition, its strong balance sheet position should let it continue returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases, which will aid its bottom line.  Partial Dampeners to Earnings GrowthHigher Provision for Loss: Provisions for losses are expected to increase as a result of higher Card Member loans and receivables, expected increases in delinquencies and net write-off rates. The increase in delinquency and net write-off rates might primarily be due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix toward non-cobrand lending products, which have higher write-off rates.These trends should lead provisions for losses to continue to grow faster than loans. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, provisions for losses are expected to be $521 million, up 29% year over year.Increase in Card Member Spending: Spending on Card Member engagement (the aggregate of rewards, Card Member services and marketing and promotion expenses) should increase due to the recent enhancements to rewards on its U.S. Platinum products, continued strong growth in its Delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of its premium services.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 0.07%.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Express is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Express has an Earning ESP of -0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Express carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. The company’s negative ESP thus leaves the case inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few companies with the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:  Houlihan Lokey, Inc. (HLI  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings performance on Feb 7. The company has an Earnings ESP of +12.73% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CIT Group Inc. (CIT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.66% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company is expected to announce fourth-quarter earnings results on Feb 21.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

58,AXP,"There’s a cryptocurrency on the market that is making huge waves right now, thanks to the booming popularity of the likes of bitcoin, Ethereum, and litecoin.Launched in 2012, ripple (XRP) is a pretty obscure cryptocurrency compared to its peers, but it’s valuation has soared in recent weeks. It’s currently worth about $3.30, with a market cap of more than $100 billion, according to Coinmarketcap; compare that to the $0.25 it was trading at just a few weeks ago in early December.It’s still worth considerably less than bitcoin, however, which is currently trading around $15,000, and has a market cap of over $250 billion.Ripple differs from bitcoin in a few ways. Instead of being created, or mined, by users, ripple’s supply is controlled by one company, San Francisco-based Ripple. The firm initially created 100 billion ripple coins—38 billion are in circulation at the moment—and the company has the ability to release up to one billion coins per month.Interestingly, ripple was actually launched in order to help simplify global financial transactions, and is connected to legitimate banks; Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), UBS (UBS  -  Free Report), and Santander SANPRA all utilize the Ripple platform. And, some financial services companies in Japan and South Korea have recently begun using Ripple’s technology, which has helped the cryptocurrency’s price jump.Ripple is believed to offer both better security and better prices over other digital currencies, and allows users to send, receive, and hold any currency in a decentralized way via RippleNet, Ripple’s payment network. According to the company, cross-border payments can go through in a matter of seconds compared to hours using bitcoin or days with other traditional financial transactions.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse spoke to Fortune last year about ripple’s liquidity appeal, saying “The liquidity needs of banks today is managed with literally ten trillion of float that sits in these nostro and vostro accounts. We believe very strong this is an inefficient model. You can use digital assets to fund liquidity, and Ripple is uniquely positioned to capitalize on that. Bitcoin takes four hours to settle a transaction. XRP takes 3.6 seconds.”But like bitcoin, ripple does use blockchain, which is like a public transaction ledge. Updated by all network users, blockchain is vital for cryptocurrencies. Blocks are produced through code by employing users’ computer power, and are then added to the blockchain. Bitcoin, for instance, is created through the generation of blocks on this network, and blockchain ensures that a unit of bitcoin is not spent more than once.The past few months saw investor and analyst interest in ripple surge, no doubt aiding its huge price gain. The company Ripple licensed its own blockchain technology to more than 100 banks as of last October, while credit card giant American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) recently introduced instant blockchain-based payments using the firm’s network.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

59,AXP,"Nothing comes for free. And this holds true for the most recent tax policy change that lowers corporate tax to 21% from 35%. Consequently, American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) will have to pay a price before reaping benefits in the long term.In a recent regulatory filing, American Express disclosed that the tax act is likely to impose nearly $2.4 billion charges in fourth-quarter 2017. The non-recurring expenses are mainly due to write-down in deferred tax assets (DTAs) (driven by reduction in corporate tax rate to 21%) and one-time tax on the company’s unrepatriated overseas earnings.This one-time charge will lead American Express to incur loss in the fourth quarter. Consequently, the company now expects 2017 earnings to fall short of its guided range of $5.80-$5.90 per share.American Express’ regulatory capital and capital ratios are expected to take a beating by adjustment  in  its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities  resulting from the tax reform. However, these will remain above the minimum regulatory capital requirements.In retrospect, we will not be surprised to see the company cutting back on its share buyback plans to address the capital shortfall.Some other big names in the financial sector like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Capital One Financial (COF  -  Free Report) have also noted that the tax reform will likely result in significant one-time charges.BofA expects to record a $3-billion charge in the fourth quarter while Citigroup anticipates to take a whopping $20-billion blow on earnings due to write-down on DTAs. In the same vein, Capital One Financial would be affected by nearly $1.9 billion on similar charges.Despite inducing a short-term pain, the tax act is projected to lend some relief to corporates in the long term.Similarly for American Express, this adverse impact is a one-time affair and the company stands to gain in the long run from higher earnings and an increase in capital deployment plans. It might also make accelerated investments in technological upgrade and other growth initiatives.Shares of American Express have nudged up 0.8% since the tax reform bill was signed into law on Dec 22, underperforming the industry’s growth of 1.4%.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

60,AXP,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) continues to be a leading provider of credit ratings, research, data & analytical tools, software solutions and related risk management services across the globe. Post the dismal 2016 performance, the company made a comeback this year.Before we dig into the factors that are likely to support the rally in 2018, let’s first check out what the factors which drove the stock this year?Despite starting on a low note, global debt and equity issuances along with M&A activities picked up pace as the year progressed. Thus, its Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) division continued to witness steady rise in revenues.Further during the year, Moody’s continued with its efforts to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. In line with this, the company acquired Amsterdam, Netherlands-based Bureau van Dijk in August 2017. Driven by the rise in demand for analytics, its Moody's Analytics division recorded solid revenue growth.Given the strong underlying business performance, Moody’s persistently revised its earnings outlook upward for 2017. Earnings are now projected to be $6.18 to $6.33 per share (up from the previous outlook of $5.69-$5.84).Driven by the strong fundamentals and improving operating environment, investors are bullish on the stock. Shares of Moody’s have jumped 56.4% so far this year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 20%. The stock has even surpassed S&P 500 rally of 20.1% year to date. Now, let’s check out the factors which are likely to provide an impetus to Moody’s stock.Driven by the improving global economy, tightening monetary policy and rise in global M&A and IPO activities, Moody’s is expected to witness an increase in bond and bank loan issuance revenues as well as higher monitoring revenues related to new ratings. Therefore, corporate finance revenues, the largest revenue contributor at the MIS division, will record a rise in 2018.Further, Moody’s is currently focused on investing in technology platform and processes to boost operations. Also, the company is undertaking initiatives to diversify into the emerging and fast growing professional services and enterprise risk solutions sectors.These efforts are well supported by Moody’s’ strong balance sheet and cash flow position. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion. This will support the company’s diversifying plans.Moreover, management expects Bureau van Dijk deal to be accretive to its 2018 adjusted earnings (excluding purchase price amortization and one-time integration expenses).However, mounting expenses and stiff completion are expected to remain concerns. Despite these issues, analysts seem to be optimistic about Moody’s prospects. Over the last 60 days, the stock has witnessed three upward estimate revisions (no downward revisions) for 2018. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.54 shows 10.3% year-over-year growth for 2018. Further next year, revenues are projected to witness a 10.3% rise to $4.51 billion.Other Stocks Worth a LookSome other top-ranked stocks in the finance space worth considering are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), MoneyGram International, Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Southern First Bancshares, Inc. (SFST  -  Free Report). All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Express’ earnings estimates were revised nearly 1% upward for 2017 over the last 60 days. Also, its share price has risen 33% year to date.MoneyGram’s earnings estimates for 2017 have been revised 3% upward over the last 60 days. Further, so far this year, the company’s shares have gained 10.6%.Southern First Bancshares witnessed a 2% rise in earnings estimates for the current year over the last 60 days. Moreover, year to date, its shares have gained 15.7%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

61,AXP,"With some of President Trump’s promises on the verge of fulfillment, the finance sector has been in the spotlight this year. A rising rate environment, progress on tax reforms and improving economic backdrop led to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 20.7% and 24%, respectively, so far this year.In the first half of 2017, financial stocks underperformed as investors began to get weary of the slow progress on Trump’s promised reforms, which ultimately led to low volatility in the markets.However, since September 2017, the stock market rebounded, crushing expectations. The Federal Reserve’s move to trim its balance sheet instilled confidence in the market.Also, positive comments by the new Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, on deregulation and his focus on rising interest rates led rally for financial stocks. The central bank hiked interest rates recently for the fifth time since the crisis and plans three more rate hikes in 2018. Also, it projects better economic growth rate in 2018.The market is gaining on expectations of higher corporate earnings next year with the implementation of the tax overhaul.Some financial stocks triumphed in 2017 by outperforming the S&P 500’s rally on the back of improving economic factors, higher certainty and strong fundamentals. These stocks still have plenty of upside left.5 Winning StocksIn order to save investors from the time-taking process of identifying the key winners that crushed the market and are likely to gain further, we have created a three-faceted screen using the Zacks Stock Screener.At first, we looked for stocks that beat the S&P 500 so far this year and have projected annualized earnings per share growth rate (for the next three to five years) of more than 8%.Next, we considered companies that have market capitalization of more than $5 billion, as they are safer to invest in.Finally, we have picked stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

62,AXP,"Shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRKA recently hit $300,000 per share, a major milestone in the company’s storied history. Buffett and the firm have come a long way, and many now point to ‘the Oracle of Omaha’ as the gold standard of long-term investing.Buffett’s company holds a massive amount shares in some of the biggest and most historic companies in the U.S., including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report). The holding company’s long-term success is also underscored by its Class B shares BRKB, which also rest near their all-time highs.Attempting to mimic Berkshire Hathaway’s success would be tough, but what investors can do in order to try to invest like Buffett is to look at the company’s holdings and find stocks that fit their own strategies.Now, let’s take a look at three stocks with high Zacks Ranks that could help investors act more like Buffett:1.      Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report)Shares of the credit card giant have surged 45.54% in 2017, which more than doubles the S&P 500’s movement. Visa is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has received 16 upward earnings estimate revisions for its current full fiscal year against no downgrades—all within the last 60 days.Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Visa’s EPS is expected to jump 12.95% in its current quarter. Looking further ahead, Visa’s full-year fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to pop by 16.45%. On top of this bottom line growth, the credit card firm’s fiscal 2018 sales are expected to hit $20.09 billion, marking a 9.45% climb—which would be strong for a company of its size and age.Visa also boasts a cash flow growth rate of 20.74%, which doubles the “Financial Transaction Services” average and looks even better compared to rival Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). This growing cash position should help the company invest more in up-and-coming payment methods, including the quickly growing mobile payment sector where Visa already operates.2.       Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM score. Shares of the retail powerhouse have climbed 41% in 2017 and 23.69% in the last 12-weeks. Walmart has also recently proved that it is prepared to take on Amazon  after posting strong e-commerce and grocery sales.Walmart’s P/S ratio is currently 0.59, helping demonstrate that the retail powerhouse presents investors with a solid bang for their respective buck. On top of that, the company is trading at 22.11x earnings, which is comparable to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry average.Within the last 60 days, Walmart has experienced nine upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and 14 for its full-year. These earnings revisions are highly important and often prove to be a strong indicator of future performance. Walmart has beat or matched earnings estimates in 13 of the last 14 quarters, including each of the trailing nine periods.3.       American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report)Shares of American Express currently sit close to their 52-week high, after climbing 13% in the last 12 weeks to help the company’s current year gains reach 34.56%. But American Express could easily break into a new range if the company matches its bottom line growth projections.American Express is projected to see its fourth quarter 2017 earnings skyrocketed by 69.56% to hit $1.54 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s sales are also expected to gain nearly 9% to hit $8.73 billion in Q4.American Express is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that is trading at 17.02 earnings, which marks a discount against its industry’s average. The credit card company has also matched or topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing three quarters, as well as seven of the last eight.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

63,AXP,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, American Express has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts American Express’ current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint (which is 14.4) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that American Express has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for American Express’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, American Express has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, American Express currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AXP a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for American Express is just 1.6, a level that is noticeably slightly lower than the industry average of 1.9. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, AXP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though American Express might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives AXP a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days, and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has nudged up 0.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:American Express Company Price and Consensus  American Express Company Price and Consensus | American Express Company QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAmerican Express is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (bottom 38% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends and broader factors to turn around first.  When they do, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

64,AXP,"Warren Buffett’s impeccable knack for investment has enabled him to beat markets most of the time since 1964, when he took over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, (BRK.B  -  Free Report). This makes Buffett the unrivaled investment guru, widely followed by equity investors across the world.His investment acumen is evident from the way Berkshire Hathaway has grown into a conglomerate, piece by piece, over the years as a result of numerous small and big acquisitions. Now, Berkshire Hathaway houses more than 90 subsidiaries, selling everything from ice-cream to insurance under one roof.Buffett manages a huge portfolio of equities, cherry picked by himself and invested in float primarily generated from Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance business. Buffett eyes bargain stocks and mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment.His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and capable management. These iron clad rules of value investing and his prowess to read Wall Street like a book has earned his securities portfolio impressive returns on investment for the past several years, a trend which continued this year too despite markets’ bull run.How Have the Markets Been This Year?The bull run of the U.S equity markets is now 9 years old, the second-longest in recent financial history. The 2017 boom was marked by Donald Trump’s take over of the White House, which pushed major indices to multiple highs on several occasions. The indices were favored by Trump’s pro growth policies to boost the economy and corporate profits, cut taxes, loosen regulations, increase spending and inflation.Trump promised to double the pace of economic growth from 2%, create 25 million jobs over 10 years, and make the domestic economy the strongest in the world. The positive sentiments sent the stock markets rallying.Performance of Buffett’s Equity PortfolioDespite equity markets’ strong rally, Buffett was able to emerge as a winner. The value of his investment portfolio as of Dec 31, 2017 was $157.65 billion, up 29% from Dec 31, 2016, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 17.2% during the same time frame. The top five positions account for nearly 60% of the portfolio: Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co., Apple Inc., (AAPL  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report).5 Stocks That OutperformedWhile Buffett’s portfolio includes equity investments in several publicly traded companies, some of them like Coca Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co. and Philips 66, which reserve big chunks, gave sub-par returns.Nevertheless, the portfolio returns outshone the markets. Here are some stocks that helped to deliver returns. Each has outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 22.5% year to date.Apple Inc. designs, manufactures and sells mobile communication devices (iPhone and iPad), media devices (iPod, Apple TV) personal computers (Mac), and related software, services, peripherals and networking solutions, worldwide.The stock, which comprised nearly 11.7% of the company’s investment portfolio as of Sep 30, 2017, has returned a good 53% year to date.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.Moody’s Corp. (MCO  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, data & analytical tools, software solutions & related risk management services, quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions.The stock made up nearly 1.9% of the company’s investment portfolio as of Sep 30, 2017, and has returned a whopping 62% year to date.

65,AXP,"Banking on three solid quarters of 2017, the board of Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) announced incremental capital deployment plans, thereby augmenting shareholder returns.In an attempt to boost capital efficiencies, the company hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 14% to 25 cents per share from the prior payout of 22 cents. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 9, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 9.The increased payout takes the annual dividend to $1.00 from 88 cents paid in 2017. At the current price, the raised yearly dividend yields 0.7%, up from the prior yield of 0.6%.Alongside this hike, the board of Mastercard sanctioned a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion. Including $1.5 billion from the last approval, the company currently has $5.5 billion worth of shares available for buybacksSolid Capital DeploymentMastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and continued cash generated (that has been increasing save in 2014) from operating activities since 2009. It generated $4.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, up 11% year over year. The same was up 8.5% year over year as of Sep 30, 2017.The company’s disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive. Last December, the company announced a new share buyback program of $4 billion and increased its quarterly dividend by 16%.  Factors at PlayArmed with strong liquidity and cash flows, we believe Mastercard is well positioned to implement the latest capital plans. The improved outlook for card spending, cross-border volumes, gross dollar value and payment volume generation given the recent strategic alliances, improving global economies and rapidly growing digital payments are likely to improve financials, going forward.Notably, global spending through credit and debit cards has grown consistently, boosting cross-border volumes, which drives revenues for card giants. Given the onset of the holiday season, we also expect improved transaction volumes and digital payments as shopping and traveling will be in the cards for most global citizens.Moreover, numerous acquisitions made in recent years have further strengthened the company’s long-term inorganic growth profile, without risking its capital. These factors will likely lead to lucrative shareholder returns and retain market confidence.Share Price PerformanceSo far this year, the stock has returned 42.8%, significantly outperforming the 25.3% gain logged by the industry.Peer TakeOther players in the same space like Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) and American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) raised their dividend payments this year by 18%,16.7% and 9%, respectively. These companies have been generously returning excess capital through share buybacks as well.Zacks RankCurrently, Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

66,AXP,"It has been a tale of two very different indexes so far on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged higher on the back of the Senate’s tax reform deal, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has slumped.The Dow’s rally today is being supported by continued strength in the financial sector. Index component JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) was up over 2.3% in morning trading, touching a new all-time high in the process.Meanwhile, investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs, which is one of the most heavily-weighted members of the index, was up about 1.5% on Wednesday morning. Other notable Dow stocks in the green include American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report).Shares of Disney gained as much as 6% in morning hours after reports of reignited buyout talks between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) surfaced. According to the latest batch of rumors, Disney has started talking to Fox about purchasing some of its assets again, with a renewed focus on its fellow media giant’s TV and movie studios (also read: Why Shares of Disney, Fox & Comcast Surged Today).Led by these strong gains, the Dow gained about 1% in Wednesday morning trading, touching an intraday high of 24,534.04 in the process. On the other hand, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dove as much as 0.5% to reach an intraday low of 6,798.48.The Nasdaq’s sluggishness comes as investors continue to transition away from the technology sector, which has dominated Wall Street for the majority of 2017.More specifically, it looks like the red-hot semiconductor industry is starting to cool off, as shares of companies like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) have all dropped significantly over the past few trading periods.Before this selloff, the Nasdaq had soared about 30% on the year, eventually settling at a new all-time high in late November. That run-up was inspired by another strong earnings report season, but now it appears that many investors are cashing out of the sector—with strong profits from this year’s rally.Additionally, the tech sector is still viewed as a high-volatility area by many investors, and recent geopolitical news may be forcing people towards more “safe and sound” options. Despite sector-wide earnings and revenue growth, Wall Street is quick to jump out of volatile areas when the threat of crisis looms—and it is probably fair to say that North Korea’s recent missile testing has caused that threat to rise.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

68,AXP,"The Dow experienced a relatively sluggish holiday shortened week, suffering losses during two trading sessions. Investors continued to remain concerned about the Trump administration’s ability to push through tax cuts. Meanwhile, tech stocks notched up strong gains. Also, the Fed’s November minutes reflected the central bank’s concern about sluggish inflation.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.4%, or 100.12 points last Friday. Investors remained cynical over the Trump administration’s ability to pass the bill in the Senate by the end of this year. This was mainly because the Senate’s version of the tax plan was quite different from that of the House panel's in several ways. Along with the tax cut woes, news of a probe into Russia’s interference in 2016 U.S. election also weighed on the Dow.The index lost 0.3% over last week, marking its second successive weekly decline. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) plummeted to a five-year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018 and halved its dividend.Moreover, oil prices declined after the IEA slashed its global crude-demand forecasts. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee announced major amendments to its version of the tax bill. Strong earnings results from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. WMT and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) helped curb gains for the index.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.3% on Monday. Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ  -  Free Report) shares increased 1.7% after Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche raised the telecom giant’s price target from 48 to 50. Fritzsche also projected stronger dividend outlook for the company. Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on the prospects of Republicans’ tax overhaul plans.The index increased 0.7% on Tuesday following gains in the technology and healthcare sectors. Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) increased 1.9% yesterday while other tech giants like Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) gained 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.48 million.The index lost 0.3% on Wednesday after Fed minutes hinted that a near term rate hike was more or less certain but future hikes could occur at a slower than expected pace due to sluggish inflation. The minutes took on a more dovish tone than previous discussion, indicating that members were concerned that persisting with soft interest rates could build up a financial bubble. Markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.Components Moving the IndexApple has purchased Canada-based AR headset maker Vrvana for $30 million to boost its augmented reality efforts, per a TechCrunch Report.

69,AXP,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.8% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.American Express Q3 Earnings Beat EstimatesAmerican Express Company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. Earnings witnessed a sharp 21% year-over-year improvement.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by increase in net interest income, higher Card spending at lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics, plus lower operating costs.Delving DeeperRevenues came in at $8.4 billion, 1.5% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.3 billion. Top line increased 8.5% year over year on higher net interest income and Card Member spending. However, lower discount rate limited the upside.Provisions for losses totaled $769 million, up 53% year over year and attributable to growth in the loan portfolio besides an expected escalation in the lending write-off and delinquency rates.Total expenses of $5.8 billion rose 6% year over year due to higher rewards’ expenses for adding new features to the company’s products and higher Card Member spending. However, marketing costs decreased.The effective tax rate was 26%, reflecting a fall from 34% in the year-ago quarter. The tax rate declined owing to realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and the geographic mix of earnings.Adjusted operating expenses reduced 4% year over year to $2.6 billion.Segment ResultsAmerican Express’ U.S. Consumer Services segment reported net income of $475 million, up 18% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expense of $3.3 billion was up 13% year over year, reflecting higher net interest income and Card Member spending.International Consumer and Network Services’ net income amounted to $286 million, up 85% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, climbed 7% year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily on the back of higher Card Member spending and net interest income.Global Commercial Services’ net income of $529 million rallied 14% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, rose 6% year over year to $2.6 billion, primarily reflecting higher Card Member spending.Global Merchant Services’ net income inched up 3% year over year to $368 million in the reported quarter. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, increased 4% year over year at $1.2 billion on higher Card Member spending, partially offset by a lower discount rate.Corporate and Other reported net loss of $302 million compared unfavorably with the net loss of $239 million in the year-ago quarter.Guides HigherThe company guided its 2017 earnings per share higher to a range of $5.80–$5.90 from earlier guidance of $5.60–$5.80 to account for continued strength in business.Recent DevelopmentsAmerican Express announced that its CEO Kenneth Chenault will step down from his post in February next year after completing nearly a long 17-year term.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since then? Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter.American Express Company Price and Consensus  American Express Company Price and Consensus | American Express Company QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, American Express's stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B.

70,AXP,"American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of blockchain-enabled, business-to-business cross-border payments. The new payment system, known as American Express FX International Payments (“FXIP”), has been developed in collaboration with Ripple — a provider of enterprise global blockchain solutions.This blockchain payments system primarily aims at lowering the time and cost of settlement, along with taking care of American Express’s commitment toward security. The company has selected Santander UK as a partner in order to introduce this new payment channel.With the collaboration between Ripple and the FXIP, consumers can execute non-card payments through Ripple’s real-time payment network, known as RippleNet. RippleNet would facilitate faster remittances from American Express customers in the United States to U.K. bank accounts through Santander.

It also provides immediate end-to-end visibility into the transaction status and cost.The blockchain technology is expected to play a transformational role in the payments processing industry. In order to maintain its leadership among other companies like Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Mastercard Inc.

71,AXP,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has been restructuring its credit and debit cards processing venture with First Data Corp (FDC) for small businesses. The company laid off about 50 employees from the venture’s sales department.Wells Fargoseesthis move as a way to align the number of employees with current volumes. Also, it remains committed to providing new jobs to the affected employees within Wells Fargo, as possible.Per Sara Hassell, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, these layoffs remain unrelated to the company’s digitization move coming up in 2018 in the form of a mobile app for the small-business merchant-services customers.Wells Fargo Merchant Services charges a fee for transaction processing and a commission from First Data on equipment leases and sales. In August 2017, a federal lawsuit was filed against the joint venture, alleging it of misleading thousands of merchants by charging them unauthorized fees.Since the breakout of sales practice scandal last year in September, Wells Fargo has laid off a considerable number of employees. Also, it has shut down branches to cope with high litigation costs.The bank remains under heightened scrutiny by the authorities. Recently, Securities and Exchange Commission imposed a $3.5 million civil penalty on Wells Fargo’s Advisory wing.Recently, Wells Fargo along with American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) formed TruSight — a company designed to combine best practices and simplify the process of conducting third-party risk assessments of suppliers and partners across the financial services industry.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 1.9% year to date versus the industry’s rally of 8.9%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

72,AXP,"The Dow notched up minor gains over the week, before ultimately declining on concerns related to Trump’s tax proposals. Mergers and acquisitions related reports helped the index notch up fresh records even though movements continued to occur within a tight band. Ultimately, prospects of a delay in the implementation of tax cuts proposals dragged the index downward toward the end of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe index gained 0.1% last Friday on the back of strong earnings performance from Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) Better-than-expected earnings and favorable quarterly outlook from the tech giant led all the three key U.S. indexes to new record highs despite mixed jobs data. Additionally, the ISM services index hit its highest level in more than 12 years, which in turn boosted the broader markets.The index gained 0.5% over last week. Benchmarks closed in positive territory for the week after the Fed chose not to hike rates this month. Moreover, the Fed offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ‘solid rate.’Also, House Republicans finally revealed a detailed framework for the new tax policy, which also boosted sentiments. Additionally, upbeat earnings results also led the markets higher.The Dow This WeekThe index inched up by 0.04% on Monday following news of a possible merger between Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). This is the 26th trading day when all-time high was achieved by all the three key U.S. indexes in 2017, marking the highest number of record highs achieved in a single year. Additionally, optimism over President Trump’s tax cut plans and upbeat third quarter earnings also boosted investor sentiment.The index once gained 0.04% on Tuesday to finish at a fresh record high. Weak profit forecasts from key stocks pulled the consumer discretionary sector downward, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. Also, decline in bond yields weighed on financials and concerns over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans resulted in a small-cap stock selloff.Meanwhile, reports emerged that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) was in talks recently with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) to acquire a large part of the latter’s entertainment business. Although, there is no certainty whether the deal will go through, shares of Walt Disney increased 1% following this development. Gains in Walt Disney boosted the blue-chip index to close on a new high.The index increased 0.03% on Wednesday, settling at yet another all-time high even as Apple’s market value jumped over the $900 billion mark for the first time ever. However, concerns remained over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans after Republicans lost elections to the governorship of Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday. These factors, along with declining bond yields weighed on bank stocks.The index declined by 0.4% on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans.Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.Components Moving the Index Disney reported negative earnings surprise in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 after beating the estimate in the trailing three quarters. Moreover, the company’s top-line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.07 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and also decreased 3% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $12,779 million, down 3% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,149 million.The company’s disappointing results in the quarter was primarily caused by dismal performance of Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which overshadowed growth at Parks and Resorts.Even though the company reported dismal results, shares inched up nearly 1% during the after-hour trading session on Nov 10 after the company announced that it has sealed a deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy.Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Canadian unit is progressing with its shale play development in the East Kaybob region located in Duvernay formation of west-central Alberta. It will be the company's first shale play development in Canada.Of the 330,000 acres in the formation, Chevron Canada holds 70% operating stakes, where it plans to start development in about 55,000 acres of the liquid-rich Duvernay. It has been almost eight years since the company registered its presence in Duvernay and is now one the biggest landholders in the basin.Chevron used its experience of operating in the North American shale assets during appraisal drilling for the project. The company has yet to provide the financial details of the project, which is expected to come online during the second half of 2019.Canadian shale plays – like Duvernay and Montney – continue to remain attractive to players like Chevron as it is much cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in these formations compared to the costly oil sands. Apart from the assets in the Duvernay formation, Chevron has stakes in the Liard and Horn River basins located in Western Canada. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) announced that it has won a $37 billion order to provide 300 planes to China Aviation Supplies Holding Company. This deal is among the several agreements concluded during President Trump’s state visit to China.According to the state owned company, which is a lessor of airplanes to China’s airlines, the deal includes the supply of 40 B-777s and B-787s as well as 260 B-737s. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, some analysts opined that this agreement could overlap with a similar 300 plane deal struck during the Chinese president’s visit to the United States in 2015. The deal concluded at that time encompassed the supply of 50 wide body aircraft and 190 B-737s as well as the lease of another 60 B-737s.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has inked three engine and aviation agreements worth $3.5 billion with Chinese partners during President Trump’s state visit to China, which is aimed at boosting trade between the United States and China. These agreements were finalized in the presence of Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping.Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) GE signed a $1.4 billion deal for engines and repairs with Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd. The company also concluded an agreement to supply 80 Leap-1B engines to ICBC Leasing, which will be utilized in 40 Boeing 737 MAX Aircraft. Also, GE will also supply $1 billion worth turbines and related components to China Datang Group.American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) has launched the Amex Advance platform which facilitates the delivery of personalized services using cutting edge machine learning techniques.

Investors have possibly priced in the impact of such tax relief measures and any unwelcome news will lead to losses in the short term. However, the current market rally is mostly a product of a resilient U.S. economy and strong earnings performances. It is likely that stocks will return to their winning ways after a brief interlude caused by such tax plan jitters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

QuoteHigher revenues as well as growth across the segments — Market Services, Information Services and Market Technology — supported this upside. However, the improvement was limited by an increase in expenses.On a GAAP basis, the company’s net income jumped 31.2% year over year to $1.01 per share.Performance in DetailNasdaq’s revenues of record $607 million improved 3.8% year over year. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $599 million, primarily owing to organic growth of $15 million and a $7 million favorable impact on the back of changes in forex rates.    Adjusted operating expenses were $317 million in the reported quarter, remaining unchanged year over year. This represents a decline in organic expense, amounting to $4 million, offset by a $4 million unfavorable impact from changes in forex rates.Notably, the company increased the lower end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.28-$1.29 billion from $1.26-$1.30 billion, guided earlier.Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services rose 4.3% from the year-ago quarter to $581 million. This upside was driven by improved revenues from European cash equities, higher volumes and pricing changes at NFX, increased customer demand for third-party connectivity, co-location and test facilities as well as a favorable impact from changes in forex rates.Revenues at Corporate Services slipped 0.6% year over year to $161 million. This was mainly due to a decline in in U.S. listings revenues due to the run-off of listing of additional shares fees, driven by implementation of the company’s all-inclusive annual fee. An increase in European listing services revenues partially offset the downside.Information Services revenues rose 9.5% year over year to $150 million. Higher shared tape plan revenues and audit collections, as well as higher assets under management in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes, drove the upside.Revenues at Market Technology increased 5.5% year over year to $77 million due to higher change request revenues, along with organic revenue growth in software as a service revenue and a positive impact due to changes in forex rates. However, lower software, licensing and support revenues partially offset the upside. Market Technology order intake totaled $66 million. The Nasdaq Stock Market witnessed 78 new listings during the third quarter, 34 of which were IPOs.Financial UpdateNasdaq had cash and cash equivalents of $530 million as of Sep 30, 2017, up 31.5% from 2016-end level.

The index ignored Trump’s hawkish comments on Iran to surge higher on Monday. The index hit a new intraday record on Tuesday and ultimately closed above 23,000 points on Wednesday. On Thursday, the index overcame the specter of the anniversary of the crash of 1987 to end in positive territory.Last Week’s PerformanceThe index gained 0.1% last Friday following the release of retail sales data which posted its highest reading in more than two years. For the month of September, retail sales increased by 1.6%. Meanwhile, President Trump ‘decertified’ the Iran nuclear deal and also planned to terminate subsidies under Obamacare to health insurers.The index gained 0.4% over last week. This was the Dow’s fifth consecutive week of gains. In the mean time, the release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes clearly hinted at a rate hike in December. Moreover, the minutes stated that a majority of the Fed officials voted in favor of the rate hike.Jobless claims plummeted to a six-week low after business resumed in Texas and Florida — areas pummeled by two destructive hurricanes. Moreover, broad based markets gained traction ahead of the beginning of third quarter earnings season as investors remained hopeful of a streak of strong earnings releases.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.4% on Monday after strong expectations from third quarter earnings led to broad based gains for the markets. The Dow amassed 85.24 points on Monday to end in positive territory. However, Trump’s comments on the Iran nuclear deal weighed on investor sentiment. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

88,AXP,"After another stellar regular trading day this Wednesday, which saw new record closing highs for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500, Q3 earnings results from several companies across a wide spectrum of industries hit the tape after the bell. United Air Lines (UAL  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) have all put out Q3 results this afternoon.American Express shares are down upon the credit card major's latest quarterly beat: earnings per share of $1.50 topped the Zacks consensus estimate by 3 cents, representing 20% growth year over year. Revenues also bested expectations, bringing in $8.44 billion in the quarter, above the $8.32 billion anticipated. The company also raised full-year earnings guidance to $5.80 - 5.90. Yet shares dipped roughly 1% in the immediate aftermath of the quarterly release.This likely has to do with the surprise announcement that AmEx's Ken Chenault will be retiring, stepping down as Chairman and CEO as of February 1st next year. Current Vice Chair Steven Squeri will assume both roles for AmEx. Also, company shares are up 24% year-to-date and 53% year over year.United also surpassed expectations on both top and bottom lines today, with $2.22 per share on $9.88 billion both improvements over the $2.12 and $9.86 billion estimated, respectively. The airline major saw its shares sell off in late trading, as well, likely based on weaker-than-expected passenger revenues and higher costs related to fuel and labor.

90,AXP,"Welcome to the second episode of Full-Court Finance, a new podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. This week, we explore the rapid rise of esports.Esports is essentially professional video gaming. The all-encompassing term covers different video games, leagues, tournaments, companies, countries, and much more. Industry revenues are projected to skyrocket 41% this year to hit $696 million while reaching 385.5 million fans,according to a report by gaming-focused market research firm Newzoo.By 2020, advertising, sponsorship, media rights, consumer spending, and video game maker investment will help make esports a $1.5 billion industry.The U.S. government has granted work visas for professional video gamers, the Olympic Council of Asia recently voted to include esports in the 2018 Asian Games after a push from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) subsidiary Alisports, and the Paris Olympic committee has even considered testing video game competitions at the summer games in 2024.Television and news giants including ESPN, NBC, and TBS have already committed to broadcasting and covering esports, which includes a focus on multiplayer online battle arena games Defense of the Ancients and League of Legends, as well as the first person shooter games Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.Esports are a massive draw for marketers and advertisers because their average audience is made up of mostly employed men between 18 to 35 years old—a demographic that has become harder to reach than ever.On top of this, gaming giants—Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)—are all invested in esports’ long-term viability and success.And major sponsors of more traditional sports are already trying to cash in on professional video gaming. Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) sponsored last year's League of Legends World Finals. American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Geico, Bud Light, Audi, Buffalo Wild Wings , and others are all esports sponsors.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) got ahead of the esports curve when it purchased esports streaming giant Twitch for about $1billion dollars in 2014. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube has its own “gaming” section that streams esports. And esports events have sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden in New York City.Activision Blizzard’s new Overwatch league, which will kick off its inaugural season in January, is set up much like many more common sports with city-based teams, regularly scheduled games, playoffs, and minimum salaries for team members. Investors, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, and others paid $20 million to purchase one of 12 teams in the league’s first season.Other major players in the sports world, such as Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Golden State Warriors ownership group are all also heavily invested in esports. And the NBA is set to launch its first ever video game league where NBA team-associated clubs will do battle on virtual NBA 2K courts starting in 2018.But you will have to listen to the whole episode to find out more about this sport of the future!If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

92,AXP,"American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18 after market close.Last quarter, this company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%. However, earnings declined 30% year over year as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain, recorded from the sale of Costco Wholesale Corp. brand portfolio.Revenues came in at $8.3 billion, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.2 billion and up 1% year over year.The company boasts an impressive surprise history, exceeding estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteQ3 FlashbackAmerican Express’ earnings results for the third quarter will likely reflect a solid progress graph, driven by the company’s current priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base.Earnings will also benefit from efforts to continue to return significant capital reserves to shareholders through dividend and share buyback programs.We expect to see an increase in net card fees, banking on a continued strength in the U.S. Platinum and Delta portfolio as well as growth in Mexico and Japan.The company’s operating expense is expected to decline owing to cost-reduction initiatives undertaken by the company.The tax is likely to have declined due to higher earnings from a lower tax rate in the international market than in the previous year. This upside is also expected to aid the bottom line.Card Member loan and receivable growth should be strong in the third quarter since the company continues to build upon loans from existing customers as well as via the acquisition of new Card Members. Provisions for losses should consequently rise as a result of higher Card Member loans and receivables as well as a slight ascent in delinquencies and higher net write-off rate.On the contrary, we expect improvement in reward expense, reflecting the company’s enhanced U.S. Platinum products, implemented at the beginning of fourth-quarter 2016, besides continued strong growth and its Delta co-brand portfolio.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Express is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

93,AXP,"While Wall Street is scaling multiple highs on Trump’s pro-growth reforms, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been an outperformer since election last year.

96,AXP,"Recently, American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) disclosed having incurred $95 million in claims to settle cardholders’ discrimination.This inconsistency surfaced during the company’s internal review process (which began in 2012) of its card product offerings in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Pacific Territories.The findings point to the fact that the terms and conditions and other frills and facilities provided on cards issued to customers in these regions were less generous and attractive compared to the ones issued in the Continental U.S.The company clarified that cards issued in any region are accordingly customized to make sure that its services and benefits are locally relevant to provide superior value to its card members.Management also said that the cards issued in the U.S. were highly competitive and offered to the public in general without any reservation pertaining to caste or creed. The company, however, confessed the relative inferiority in cards issued in the Pacific and Atlantic territories and that this should not have been so.American Express voluntary reported this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and accepted its shortcoming by a compensation of $95 million from 2013-2013 to more than 200,000 affected customers.The regulators acknowledged this remedial measure taken by the company that saved it from civil penalties. Regulators have, however, asked the company to make an additional payment of $1 million.The bureau also accused American Express of discriminating between its customers on the basis of race and ethnic background, which has been rebuffed by the latter.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 31%, outpacing the 22% gain by the industry it belongs to.We believe this settlement by American Express is aimed at shielding its customer base. It should help in customer retention and stabilizing market share.The payments space is intensely competitive which makes it a hard task to tap new customers and retain old ones, something which is imperative for long-term growth for the players in this industry.American Express has in the recent past sustained weak results from parting ways with one of its major clients Costco Wholesale Corp. (last year). In order to make up for the loss from this foregone business, the company took up massive marketing expenditure and won some clients and deals though not as big as Costco.The company is thus not in a position to face any unfavorable development which may further hurt its already fragile business.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmerican Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the same space are Green Dot Corp. (GDOT  -  Free Report), Vantiv, Inc.  and Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report). While Green Dot sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), the other two carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Green Dot has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days. In one year, the company’s share price has risen more than 99%.Vantiv has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days. Further, the stock has surged nearly 35.1% in the last 12 months.Western Union has been recording upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days. It beat estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4%.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

97,AXP,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report). During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.47 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%, but witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. However, when comparing year over year, the bottom line suffered as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain recorded from the sale of the Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report).Overall results reflected solid progress against the company’s current priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base.American Express is set to benefit from continued secular growth of electronic payments globally. Convenience, security, and enhanced services and rewards for consumers continue to fuel growth in electronic payments.The company remains focused on several initiatives to strengthen operations. These include renewed focus on its Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., Small Business Saturday to leverage on the ongoing expansion of its merchant network in the U.S. through the OptBlue program. Through OptBlue the company has set an aggressive goal – to achieve merchant coverage on a par with Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and MasterCard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) in the U.S. by the end of 2019.  Apart from taking measures to grow its top line, the company has also launched cost initiatives designed to remove $1 billion from its overall cost base by the end of 2017. Adjusted operating expenses decreased in the first half of 2016, reflecting progress against cost reduction initiatives. The company is on track to reduce $1 billion from cost based on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017.American Express enjoys a strong capital position and is committed to enhance shareholders’ value. The company’s 2017 capital plan received the Federal Reserve’s approval, following which it announced a 9.4% hike in its quarterly dividend. The capital plan includes repurchase of up to $4.4 billion of common shares through the second quarter of 2018.    Nevertheless, the company continues to face an increase in provision for loan loss. Also, increased rewards and marketing costs in order to fold more business will hurt margins.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

98,AXP,"(0:40) - Brand Value Investing Strategy(3:00) - How To Find The Strongest Company Brands(5:00) - BVAL Overview: Sector Breakdown, Unrealized Value and Market Cap(9:30) - ACSI: Customer Satisfaction  (11:45) - What's In The Future For Exponential ETFs?(13:10) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comStrong brands often make for strong companies, but is there a connection between brands and stock prices as well?Well, this week’s guest on the Dutram Report—Phil Bak, the CEO of Exponential ETFs-- believes there is a correlation between the two, and that many investors are overlooking this key factor when constructing their portfolios. This is because brand value isn’t something that is measured by most as an aspect of corporate value, despite its key role in the health of many companies. But how do you find these undervalued brands that have staying power?How to Find Companies with Powerful BrandsOne way to do it is to look at a number of key factors that go in to determining brand power, namely familiarity and favorability. It is hard to have a good brand if people aren’t familiar with you, while you want to make sure that people have a positive opinion of a given brand as well.Combining these factors gets you an idea of how powerful a company’s brand really is in the scheme of things, and relative to others in a sector. Phil also talks about other key aspects of finding companies with strong brands in the podcast, and how to find undervalued ones as well.Strategy in ETF FormPhil Bak discusses how Exponential ETFs uses a Brandometry index, the BrandTransact50 Index, in order to invest in 50 companies that have brand equity value not recognized in their share prices. This equally-weighted benchmark doesn’t just invest in a bunch of companies with strong brands though, as it looks to find firms that have unrealized brand value relative to market cap.This is a key distinction, and it is what gives the ETF that follows this approach, the Brand Value ETF (BVAL  -  Free Report), a unique standing in the market. We debate how this focus on undervalued companies impacts the portfolio, as well as some components in the fund.In particular, we discuss some companies that you might think of when you hear the words ‘strong brands’. Sure, companies like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) make the cut, but so do ones like Bloomin’ Brands (BLMN  -  Free Report), which is the parent of Outback Steakhouse, as well as Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report). We talk about some of the characteristics of some of these companies and what has surprised Phil from the holdings list as well.We also talk about some of the sector and cap issues that this sort of strategy might face, as well as the idea of large caps having stronger brand names in general. Phil also goes over how this product might fit into an average investor’s portfolio if you are thinking about this strategy and like the concept.Similar Funds from the Group?Finally, we also discuss what is next for Exponential ETFs, and some other funds that Mr. Bak is involved with these days. In particular, we highlight the American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI  -  Free Report).This ETF focuses on the idea that companies that do a better of satisfying their customers than their peers will outperform over time. There are some pretty obvious parallels between this approach and the brand value one, and we explore that idea as well as how some companies, such as Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), might be deriving a significant portion of their brand value from the job they do satisfying customers. But listen to the podcast for additional information on this idea and the world of brands too!Bottom LineBut what do you think about brand value? Make sure to write us in at podcast @ zacks.com or find me on Twitter @EricDutram to give us your thoughts on this, or anything else in the fund market.But for more news and discussion regarding the world of investing, make sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of the Dutram Report (each and every Thursday!) and check out the many other great Zacks podcasts as well!And for additional insights from the Exponential ETFs team, check out our earlier podcast the group that focuses on their customer satisfaction ETF, ACSI:Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

Earnings results guided the Dow’s fortunes over the next two trading days of the week. However, it was a deal between two retailing majors which led to losses for a key component, and hence for the index itself on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row last Friday. The 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year, increasing by 0.4% as tech stocks gained. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Investors also digested a couple of poor economic reports on retail sales and inflation, which led market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The index gained 1% last week even as all major benchmarks posted solid gains. The indexes overcame a series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.The Dow This WeekThe index declined a meager 0.04% on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week.

106,AXP,"American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. However, earnings witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. However, when comparing year-over-year, the bottom line suffered as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain recorded from the sale of the Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report) co-brand portfolio.The company reaffirmed its earlier EPS guidance of $5.60–$5.80 for 2017.Revenues came in at $8.3 billion, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.2 billion and up 1% year over year.American Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteNotably, excluding the Costco-related business and the effect of foreign exchange rates, adjusted revenues climbed 8% driven by higher adjusted Card Member spending and net intere American Express acquired 2.7 million new card users globally and “card member spending grew 8%.”Provisions for losses totaled $584 million, up 26% year over year, led by higher loans disbursed by the company and a higher loan write-off rate.Total expenses of $5.8 billion increased 21% year over year due to higher rewards’ expenses as the company added new features to its products to woo and retain customers.The effective tax rate was 31%, reflecting a decrease from 33% in the year-ago quarter. The tax rate declined due to higher earnings from a lower tax rate in the international market than in the prior-year.Segment ResultsAmerican Express’ U.S. Consumer Services segment reported net income of $440 million in second-quarter 2017, plunging 59% year over year. Notably, the year-ago quarter included Costco-related revenues, expenses and gains related to the sale of its loan portfolio. Total revenue, net of interest expense, remained flat year over year at $3.2 billion.International Consumer and Network Services’ net income amounted to $209 million, down 8% year over year. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, inched up 1% year over year to $1.4 billion, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, net interest income and net card fees. This was in part offset by contractual partner payment in the year-ago quarter.    Global Commercial Services’ net income of $500 million plummeted 13% year over year, primarily due to higher net income in the year-ago quarter that benefited from Costco-related revenues, and expenses and gains from the sale of the Costco portfolio. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, increased 3% year over year to $2.6 billion, primarily reflecting higher Card Member spending.Global Merchant Services’ net income increased 15% year over year to $430 million in the reported quarter. Total revenue, net of interest expenses, remained flat year over year at $1.2 billion. The prior-year quarter included Costco-related revenues.Corporate and Other reported net loss of $239 million compared with net loss of $229 million in the year-ago quarter.American Express' return on average common equity (ROCE) was 21.7% as of Jun 30 2017, down 470 basis points year over year.Recent DevelopmentsThe company comfortably cleared its 2017 capital plan for the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review by regulators. Consequently, it has increased quarterly dividend by 9.4% to 35 cents per share, and will buy back up to $4.4 billion of common shares over the next four quarters.Our TakeSecond-quarter results reflect gradual improvement in the company’s efforts to grow its client base, increase the issuance of new cards, and retain clients by offering them frills on cards. Its strength in the consumer and international business lines should continue to support growth.Going forward, we expect to see favorable earnings performance by the company given that it will continue with its elevated spending on growth initiatives. Its efforts toward reducing the cost base and disciplined capital management will further support the bottom line.Zacks Rank and Other StocksAmerican Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

108,AXP,"As we mull earnings reports from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) from Tuesday afternoon and more Wall Street investment firms this morning, we also see fresh data on June Housing Starts and Permits. Both headline numbers came in hotter than expected: 1.215 million on June starts (up 8.3%) and 1.254 million in permits (up 7.4%). (These results are seasonally adjusted and annualized.)Housing Starts in May also saw a positive revision from 1.09 million units to 1.12 million. Analysts had only expected a 5.5% increase in starts and just 1.7% in permits. Starts were bolstered by a strong 849K in single-family housing. All this said, we are still well off the multi-year highs of roughly 2 million annualized housing starts per month.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped estimates on both top and bottom lines ahead of the bell this morning: 87 cents per share beat the 76 cents expected, and the $9.5 billion in revenues easily surpassed the $8.9 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. These results beat fairly low bars for Morgan in the quarter, however: our consensus earnings estimate for Q2 had tumbled more than 10% in the past month.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for its Q2 earnings and revenues, albeit more slightly: 85 cents per share beat by a penny, and revenues of $5.49 billion outperformed the $5.46 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is a very typical quarterly performance for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock: the trailing 4-quarter average earnings beat — in which the bank topped expectations each time — was 1.55%.Wednesday after the bell will give us a breather of sorts, with American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS  -  Free Report) reporting after the bell, but the real marquee names of earnings season begin after the bell with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Thursday afternoon, and then the dam really breaks open next week.

110,AXP,"Major credit card processors are scheduled to report earnings over this week and the next. While, American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report earnings within a day of each other, Mastercard Inc.’s (MA  -  Free Report) earnings are due for release next week.Visa has profited considerably from American Express’ loss of its lucrative partnership with Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), which it has now added to its bag of tie-ups. The reunion with Visa Europe has also strengthened the card processor.Meanwhile, Mastercard is benefiting from its inorganic growth strategy, such as its acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security. Its partnerships, such as its deal with PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) have also widened its business opportunities. Meanwhile, Mastercard is making significant progress in its digital strategy and continuously investing in technology.With Visa and Mastercard scheduled to report within a week of each other, on Jul 20 and Jul 27, respectively this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceShares of both Mastercard and Visa have notched up gains in the year to date period. Visa is marginally ahead with a gain of 24.1%. However, Mastercard is not far behind with an increase of 23.4%, ahead of both the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry and the S&P 500 which have gained 20.2% and 10%, respectively during this period.ValuationThe average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio is the best multiple for valuing the card processing business because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 24.23, Mastercard is overvalued compared to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. On the other hand, Visa has a P/B ratio of 8.10, which is why it is undervalued compared to both the broader industry as well as Mastercard. Dividend YieldComing to dividend yield, while the Financial Transaction Services industry offers a dividend yield of 0.7%, Mastercard offers a marginally lower return of 0.69%. Visa is not far behind, with a dividend yield of 0.68%, which means that this round is too close to call.Earnings History ESP, Estimate Revisions and EPS GrowthRiding on higher revenues, Visa posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) earnings of 86 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 27% year over year. Net operating revenue of $4.5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.2 billion. Also, revenues climbed 23% year over year.Meanwhile, Mastercard reported first-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.01 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 7.4%. Also, earnings improved 17.4% year over year. MasterCard posted revenues of $2.73 billion for the reported quarter, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 11.8%.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Mastercard and Visa have delivered positive earnings surprises over the last two quarters. However, Visa holds a slight edge with an average earnings surprise of 7.2% versus Mastercard’s figure of 6.4%. Visa also has a higher expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year, compared to Mastercard’s expected rate of 13.9%.However, when considering Earnings ESP, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks, with both having readings of 0. Estimate revisions for both stocks have increased by 0.1% over the last 30 days.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that there is nothing to choose between Mastercard and Visa when considering Earnings ESP and estimate revisions. Additionally, both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2. While Mastercard offers a marginally higher dividend yield, Visa holds a clear edge when considering earnings history, price performance, expected EPS growth and valuations. This is why it may be better to bet on Visa over Mastercard.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

111,AXP,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the expectation. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAlliance Data is estimated to have generated improved revenues on the back of a strong performance across each segment. While higher receivables are expected to have favored better results at Card Services segment, higher numbers to contracts supported a decent performance at Epsilon segment.Average receivables increased 16% in the first half of 2017. The company continues to witness growth in auto, CRM and data supporting Epsilon segment.BrandLoyalty performance has likely been driven by growth across the U.S., Europe, Asia as well as expansion efforts in Canada.The bottom line got additional support from share repurchases.However, delinquency rates as on Jun 30, 2017 deteriorated 46 basis points from last year. Expenses are anticipated to have escalated, weighing on margin expansion.The company’s share price has been fluctuating over the last few days and is currently trading at $262.07. We wait to see how the stock performs, post the earnings release.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alliance Data is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Alliance Data has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $3.47. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alliance Data carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the finance sector, having the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter, are as follows.Everest Re Limited (RE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.26% and a Zacks Rank #2.

112,AXP,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because American Express is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AXP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.50 per share for AXP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AXP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.04% heading into earnings season.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise  American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AXP has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for American Express, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

113,AXP,"We expect American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter results on Apr 19, before market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that American Express has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.04%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.50 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47. The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We expect American Express’ second-quarter results to showcase the benefits of its cost reduction efforts over the last couple of years.Continued return of significant capital to shareholders through its dividend and share buyback programs will aid bottom lineThe company’s Global Commercial Services segment is expected to give a muted performance as travel and entertainment spending by large corporations remains at low levels.We expect to see higher net card fees driven by continued strength in its premium U.S. portfolios including Platinum, Gold and Delta, as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia.Second-quarter results will likely reflect an increase in loan lending. Also, focus on existing card members and increased use of digital channels is expected to drive new card issuance.Nevertheless, card spending volumes at another of the company’s segments — Global Network and Merchant Services — is expected to be under pressure due to the changing regulatory environment specifically in the European Union, Australia and China.We also expect to see higher reward expense, which will weigh on margins, as the company has made enhancements to its U.S. platinum products to woo and retain its customers.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.
