0,IR,"French big pharma Sanofi laid out its seven-year plan for drug launches, which it says will bring in a cumulative 30 billion euros ($37.6 billion) in their first five years of sales. But Sanofi stock slipped 3% in early trading on the stock market today, as its diabetes outlook was soft.
"
1,IR,"Sanofi (SNY) issued its update in a press release ahead of its IR Thematic Seminar on New Medicines, in which it sought to reassure investors after it fired its CEO following a weak quarterly report last month.
"
2,IR,"The firm prepared nine presentations on its new drugs, including alirocumab, the cholesterol fighter that it co-developed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), which now goes under the brand name Praluent; the recently approved multiple-sclerosis pill Lemtrada; and Toujeo, currently under FDA and EU review as an updated version of the bestselling Sanofi diabetes drug Lantus.
"
3,IR,"On a related note, on Thursday the FDA also granted breakthrough-therapy designation to dupilumab, a drug developed under the same Regeneron partnership as alirocumab, as a treatment for atopic dermatitis.
"
4,IR,"Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note early Thursday that while the pipeline valuation was nearly twice his own estimate, he's still concerned about the diabetes franchise, which was the main issue in Sanofi's Q3 report.
"
5,IR,"""Despite a headline-grabbing estimate for the 2014-2020 product launches ... guidance that SNY's global diabetes business will be flat to slightly growing in 2015-2018 (at constant exchange rates) and that 'assumes substantial conversion of patients from Lantus to Toujeo in the US and Europe' is below our assumed diabetes sales growth of 2% during the same period,"" he wrote.
"
6,IR,"Fernandez added that he wasn't sold on widespread Toujeo conversion, especially in light of a more competitive landscape with similar products coming online from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY).
"
7,IR,"On the positive side, he wrote that approval of Praluent is virtually assured since Merck's (MRK) recent long-term study proving that lowering LDL cholesterol really does lower the death rate from heart disease.

"
14,IR,"There's nothing like a promising corporate marriage to make a big splash on Wall Street.
"
15,IR,"That's how the scenario has played out for water products industry leader Pentair (PNR). Its stock has spurted up about 62% since the company tied the knot with Tyco International's (TYC) Tyco Flow division, in September 2012, six months after announcing plans.
"
16,IR,"The $10 billion stock-for-stock merger created a roughly $8 billion-a-year powerhouse in flow control, filtration and equipment protection. Tyco Flow complements Pentair's offerings and gives it a strong position in fast-growing markets, including the energy arena, while giving a nice lift to revenue and profit, as well as generating cost synergies.
"
17,IR,"The combo also gives Pentair an opportunity to apply its Pentair Integrated Management System to Tyco Flow's business with the goal of boosting efficiency, performance and productivity — in turn driving earnings growth, analysts say. The PIMS approach, as Pentair calls it, involves a studied set of methods and processes for finding new market opportunities, speeding product development and planning rollouts, while trying to stay lean and sharp as a company.
"
18,IR,"Pentair was already a big player in the water and fluid systems arena prior to the merger, with products ranging from energy-efficient pumps and point-of-use filtration to engineered pumps and fluid processing systems. It also had a strong position in technical solutions with products that guard and protect electronics and electrical equipment such as enclosures and cases, and made heat management equipment and thermal management systems.
"
19,IR,"Tying With Tyco
"
20,IR,"Tyco Flow, a maker of flow control products, added to the mix a lineup including highly engineered valves and controls used in energy, general process, mining and water industries.
"
21,IR,"""The deal was transformational,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy. ""It gets Pentair into the energy market where they weren't a player, and from a financial perspective it doubled the size of the company.""
"
22,IR,"Pentair posted revenue of $4.4 billion in 2012. It estimates 2013 sales will grow to $7.4 billion.
"
23,IR,"The rationale behind the deal was diversification, says Quealy.
"
24,IR,"Prior to the merger, he says, Pentair was ""very strong"" in water and electrical equipment, but had ""de minimis"" exposure to energy. Meanwhile Tyco was ""very strong"" in energy-related applications, he adds, and energy was an area in which Pentair intended to participate.
"
25,IR,"The combination gives Pentair more exposure to energy applications in industrial sectors and doubles its presence in the energy sector as a combined company, said CEO Randall Hogan on a conference call in March 2012 announcing the deal. Pentair expected the transaction to be ""highly accretive"" to earnings, adding 40 cents a share to 2013 earnings. It estimates combined company earnings will be greater than $5 a share by 2015, reflecting synergies through efforts such as streamlining operations and economies of scale.
"
26,IR,"Since closing the deal, adds Quealy, Pentair has ""encouraged the Street"" it can hit the 2015 earnings target. Most recently, on Dec. 10, Pentair said in a statement that it ""remains committed to the target synergies from the transaction, and its $5 per share 2015 EPS goal.""
"
27,IR,"Pentair is able to drive earnings through operating efficiencies and continuous improvement processes, says Wedbush Securities analyst David Rose.
"
28,IR,"""It's still very early in the process, but right out of the gate it looks like the company is a little ahead of expectations in cost-saving synergies,"" he said. ""The outlook so far is encouraging.""
"
29,IR,"Fruits Of Synergy
"
30,IR,"Investors believe the merger was a good move for the company, he says, and consequently the stock has made a fairly large move.
"
31,IR,"""We think there are a lot of opportunities ahead and clearly see the path to more operating efficiencies and cost reductions,"" Rose said, ""probably on the higher end of expectations.""
"
32,IR,"Pentair now expects its ""realized synergies"" relating to the merger integration in 2013 to be about $120 million, above the $90 million previously estimated, said Hogan on the company's Oct. 22 third-quarter conference call.
"
33,IR,"""The increase over previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and lean savings in Flow Control and is the result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system,"" Hogan said.
"
34,IR,"Quealy figures Pentair is in about the ""third or fourth inning"" of the merger integration process.
"
35,IR,"Pentair will likely shed more light on its prospects in the wake of the merger when it gives its full-year 2014 outlook on Tuesday.
"
36,IR,"Quealy says he expects the forecast to be ""consistent with other industrials,"" and that he doesn't expect any ""major surprises.""
"
37,IR,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see 2014 earnings rising 24% to $3.96 a share.
"
38,IR,"Meanwhile, Pentair is faring well on the financial front, with double-digit profit gains the past two quarters. Earnings rose 34% to 86 cents a share in the third quarter. Sales jumped 111% to $1.8 billion. Analysts expect full-year earnings to rise 34% to $3.20 a share.
"
39,IR,"""The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line, as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%,"" said Hogan on the quarter's conference call. ""Price and productivity more than offset inflation, mix was positive and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25%, even though sales declined 1% organically.""
"
40,IR,"Regional Ups And Downs
"
41,IR,"But sales were $50 million below Pentair's expectations, he added, due primarily to weak results in Australia. The weakness was not only related to the local economy, but also ""a significant foreign exchange head wind,"" he said.
"
42,IR,"On a brighter note, Pentair continues to see strength in the residential end market as it benefits from an improving housing market in North America and more spending on dwellings amid rising home values.
"
43,IR,"Pentair's huge lineup for this market ranges from treatment products that filter and purify water to energy-efficient systems that ensure water pressure is just right. Pentair is also a leading provider of pool and spa equipment.
"
44,IR,"Sales in the residential and commercial end markets, which accounted for about 45% of the company's Water & Fluid Solutions segment revenue in the quarter, rose 12% from a year earlier.
"
45,IR,"The food and beverage sector — also a part of the Water & Fluid Solutions segment — remained ""very strong"" in the quarter, Hogan says. Sales to that market grew 20%.
"
46,IR,"In the Valves & Controls segment, created after the Tyco Flow merger, sales declined 1% in the quarter. They would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded, said Hogan on the call.
"
47,IR,"Sales to the oil and gas industry were flat, he added, as many ""downstream"" customers deferred annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity.
"
48,IR,"Pentair is the fifth-largest company by market cap in IBD's Machinery-General Industrial industry group, after Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Ingersoll-Rand Co. (IR) and Dover (DOV). The group currently ranks No. 20 of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.
"
49,IR,"On Tuesday Pentair announced that its board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $1 billion through Dec. 31, 2016. The buyback will leave Pentair with another $2 billion in cash and balance sheet capacity for additional business reinvestment or share repurchase by 2015, Hogan said in a statement.
"
50,IR,"The same day, Pentair said that its board has approved changing the parent company's place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed change at an anticipated second-quarter shareholders meeting.
"
51,IR,"The current Swiss firm Pentair Ltd. will become a newly-formed Irish company named Pentair PLC.

"
56,IR,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout.

61,IR,"In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. ""Good morning, Siri,"" he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted.""Your home is ready to rise and shine,"" the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, Calif., Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar (LEN), was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app.As iPhone sales growth  slows, Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of model homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem — and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets.""We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. ""The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.""The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage ""touch-screen deadbolt,"" which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot (HD) -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, Calif., about 15 minutes from Facebook's (FB) headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH) is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity.With the words ""good night,"" the light turns purple. With a ""good morning,"" it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, ""which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,"" according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties (BRP) and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.""Give me a break,"" he said. ""That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool.""Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target (TGT) opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie — made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail — or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.""The smart home will get there but it's not there yet,"" Reck said. ""Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.""As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.""Certain devices obey, and some do not,"" Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand (IR).Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a ""halo effect,"" helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a ""cool"" alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Fla.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart-home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds.""I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds — apparently it's just too much for me at that point,"" Bieber said. ""I'm so used to saying things and they just happen.""Related:No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleHomebuilder Confidence Cools As Housing Market Takes A BreakApple iPhone 7 Makes Big Q3 Impact In Just 2 Weeks Of Sales

(ETN) and Pentair (PNR) would feel the pain especially.Trump set off a storm in the stock markets Thursday, saying he would impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. While he said Monday that he doesn't think there will be a trade war, he added that the U.S. is ""not backing down"" on tariffs.Eaton has already sized the tariff impact as a potential 2% headwind to 2018 earnings per share, Dray noted.Overall, the tariffs would squeeze near-term margins for manufacturers of automobiles, HVAC systems, electrical equipment, and construction or building products, Dray added.Still, RBC expects multi-industry companies to eventually withstand the tariff  impact, citing strong underlying fundamentals in the manufacturing sector and the recent tax reform windfall.Shares of United Technologies closed up 1.4% at 131.71 on the stock market today, on reports that Republicans in Congress were pushing back more against the tariff plan.

"
79,IR,"It is POST TIME! That time defined as the 'specific time' when the race begins.....when all participants need to be locked and loaded in the narrow gates awaiting the starters call......Yes folks - its RACE day or rather RACE month....when the CEO's & CFO's must confess the financial condition of publicly traded companies....and on each race day - the grooms - in this case the IR guy/gal leads the 'horse' to the 'saddling paddock'. The identifier checks the horse's identity (listed company) to make sure that the results correspond with the proper 'horse'. Then the horse is saddled up and the jockeys (usually the CFO) are given instructions on how to proceed. The jockey adorned in the 'silks' of the horse's owner ( in this case the CEO) are given instructions on how to proceed and together the jockey and the owner take their places....And they are OFF!Last night - post close - we got the first taste of what is expected to be a tough race.....Alcoa (AA) comes out of the gate stumbling....1Q earnings of .07 cts/sh were down 92%, Yes - earnings BEAT the estimate but top line revenues missed big time......coming in at $4.95 bil vs. the expectation of $5.20 bil....... Klaus Kleinfeld (CEO) discussed weak aluminum prices (down 40% over the last 5 yrs) and the state of the global economy.....2000 jobs are on the line because of weak mkts around the world......The stock fell 4% in after hours trading and is currently trading at $9.34 down 0.40 cts off of last night's close....'and so it was written' the season has begun.....'Stocks popped at the open but the rally was short-lived....stocks failed to sustain the early upside spike and stocks turned lower...sellers dominating the day and selling into the rally. The pullback attributed to the beginning of what is predicted to be a disappointing earnings season.What also added to the sour mood was the double secret meeting between Yellen and the Fed governors. Following this surprise expedited meeting, Janet Yellen met with President Obama to discuss the state of the economy. Now just an FYI - this was the first time since November 2014 that the sitting Fed chair has met one on one with the president....and the media was not invited...so what did they discuss? Rate hike - nah, GDP - maybe, the real unemployment rate? Doubtful - as Obama thinks it's all a bed of roses.....How about the state of the banking industry and how the global contraction has affected the industry....How about the quality of assets, how about margin compression and growth prospects in this less than stellar environment....... especially after two central banks - the ECB and the BoJ initiated negative interest rates. Oh boy.....so much to say....Now as discussed - we are expecting earnings to be down y/y - and as of the end of March - that number has been 'adjusted' to -8.5%....(slight improvement...) Energy, financials and industrials to take the brunt of the blame...... this will be the 4th straight qtr of EPS (Earnings per share) declines....but do not be concerned.....because as usual - expect to see 70% of those earnings 'beat the estimates' - but like Alcoa - will they beat due to cost cutting or will they actually GROW top line revenues? The jury is still out - but my money says - the majority of the 'beats' will come from 'expense management' vs organic growth.....Today we get a bit of a reprieve before the financials line up in the starting gate.....Wednesday - look for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) followed by the usual suspects - Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank Of America (BAC)..... Will weak earnings be discounted? Are we really expecting that 'hockey stick' recovery in the second half of 2016? And if so then this is a gift for the longer term investor...because if this as bad as it gets - then future action can only be UP......unless of course the mkt does not believe it and the guidance is less than stellar.....Now the VIX - is giving us a whole different storyline.....this index (otherwise known as the FEAR Index) - has fallen to a 7 month low.... What its telling us is that the mkts are not concerned about almost anything at the moment and some of the industry's recent surveys confirm this lack of concern.......The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) reveals that pessimism is at a 5 month low of 32.2% - well below the historical average of 39%. Bank of America's ""Bull & Bear"" index recently surged to 4.1, up dramatically from the March low of 0.1......,suggesting the most bullish reading in 9 months. So when everyone is so bullish - what's left??? But buyer beware....this can change in a heartbeat - as any number of things could cause a change in psychology....or sentiment.Yes - it's all nice when everyone plays nice on the jungle gym....but as soon as we get something unexpected then we could see a rather swift and painful sell off...Remember - as I have pointed out - the next two months is traditionally weak and with the US in the middle of a nasty presidential election cycle - so much can happen that will change the direction of the conversation.Risk remains high.....FED policy is uncertain and if the FED is forced to raise rates too quickly - then prepare for the massacre, Europe's economy is on the edge, China is slowing, a Yuan devaluation is NOT out of the question, negative interest rates causing concern around the globe, and continued currency wars and the geopolitical risks of terrorism, war and immigration could easily ignite mkt volatility and are only a few of the risks that exist.US futures are higher by 5pts this morning - no matter what the Alcoa earnings say.....The mkt remains stuck in the 2040/2070 range but feels a bit heavier each day.....a decisive break below 2040 will take us back to support at 2014. Remember - the underlying tone of the mkt is suspect at best......Bank earnings are now the next big thing for investors to watch and mkts to digest.We have 3 FED speeches today....Philly's Patrick Harker at 9 am, San Fran's John Williams at 3 pm, and Richmond's Jeffrey Lacker at 4 pm. Can't wait to hear what prophetic words are on the teleprompter....How will mkts react or have the mkts now decided that all of this FED speak is just noise?Take Good Care

87,IR,"When it comes to the Internet, Peter Goldmacher has seen a lot of it from the outside. Now, he's seeing it from the inside.
"
88,IR,"Goldmacher this year ended a 14-year career as a Wall Street analyst at Cowen and Co. and Merrill Lynch to become vice president of strategy and market development for privately held Aerospike , a maker of next-generation NoSQL open-source database software.
"
89,IR,"Aerospike has its work cut out for it with rivals that include FoundationDB, acquired in March by a little company called Apple (AAPL), not to mention longtime database powers like market leader Oracle (ORCL).
"
90,IR,"As an analyst, Goldmacher got to witness several boom-and-bust Internet periods, including the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and the recent flurry of enterprise software IPOs.
"
91,IR,"He recently spoke with IBD about his new company and the changing Internet.
"
92,IR,"IBD: How does the original Internet boom compare with today's market?
"
93,IR,"Goldmacher: In the original boom, the Internet was new and poorly understood. Replicating any business model on the Internet seemed like a great idea. Now, entirely new business models have created the same enthusiasm. Nobody would have ever imagined a Snapchat or an Uber doing brand-new things. Some of these businesses are delivering phenomenal results in dramatic market adoption or actual profitability.
"
94,IR,"IBD: Who is leading the Big Data and cloud markets?
"
95,IR,"Goldmacher: In the data world, you don't have a public company leading the charge this time. You have extremely well-funded private companies like MongoDB, Cloudera, DataStax and Hortonworks (HDP), which was well-funded before going public.
"
96,IR,"In the cloud, Salesforce.com (CRM) kicked down the door and let everyone else through. Now, you have a different lineup of infrastructure players. Oracle, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Sun Microsystems and EMC (EMC) were the four horsemen of the Internet. But they are becoming increasingly marginalized. They have become too big, staid and vested in defending legacy businesses to really innovate and disrupt themselves.
"
97,IR,"IBD: Did Oracle and SAP (SAP) wait too long to adopt the cloud and a subscription-based model?
"
98,IR,"Goldmacher: They had a very deliberate choice to make: ""Do we completely reinvent the business, rewrite the technology and our financials in order to go after this market? Or do we let other people innovate and layer that innovation through M&A?""
"
99,IR,"(Growing cloud businesses via M&A) was the right thing. They still have distribution, which is what every startup wants. Even though we like to poke fun at those guys, they are great for competitive positioning.
"
100,IR,"IBD: When will the cloud become a relevant piece of Oracle's revenue?
"
101,IR,"Goldmacher: It's predicated on M&A. They are getting into some compelling markets, like marketing automation, that are pretty much only being written in the cloud. (But) there will be other parts of their business that will never be cloud or certainly won't be cloud for a very long time.
"
102,IR,"IBD: Is the NoSQL database market a threat to Oracle's relational database market?
"
103,IR,"Goldmacher: It's a material threat. You have more contemporary technology in the NoSQL market at more compelling prices because so much functionality is delivered through open source that it is often free, so you are seeing most new projects being developed in some sort of NoSQL software.
"
104,IR,"IBD: What is the difference between NoSQL and Oracle's relational database?
"
105,IR,"Goldmacher: The major difference is a lot of these NoSQL technologies are more cost-effective and flexible to write applications that can handle the new requirements of the explosion in data.
"
106,IR,"IBD: How does Aerospike differentiate itself from the crowd of NoSQL vendors?
"
107,IR,"Goldmacher: Within NoSQL you have subdivisions. The subdivision we participate in gives you the ability to write and read data to a database very quickly. Because we run in flash (optimized for storing data in flash, or solid-state, drives), you need a lot less hardware, so we are much more cost-effective.
"
108,IR,"IBD: How does Apple's acquisition of FoundationDB affect Aerospike?
"
109,IR,"Goldmacher: It's really exciting for us, because companies like Apple are so innovative around the technologies they use to support their business. By purchasing FoundationDB, they will be able to go from 75,000 servers to around 10,000. It gives Apple next-generation technology to continue to innovate.
"
110,IR,"IBD: Why leave Wall Street to join a privately held enterprise software company?
"
111,IR,"Goldmacher: When you spend 14 years of your career on the sidelines throwing rocks, at some point you have to put your helmet on and get into the game. My Wall Street career had played itself out. The creativity around how people are using data is phenomenally interesting. I really wanted to embark on a second act while I was still young enough.
"
112,IR,"IBD: Is Aerospike planning an IPO?
"
113,IR,"Goldmacher: We have a lot of things we need to do internally before can have a legitimate conversation about an IPO. But if we execute the way we are capable of, our product should enable us to go public.

151,IR,"The public saw up to 2,000 ad messages a day 30 years ago compared with 5,000 messages now, the New York Times reports. It’s absolute sensory overload.So notes Winnie Brignac Hart, who along with Lorrie Brignac Lee wrote “Stand Out: Tools to Master the 8 Fundamentals of Standing out in Business.”Hart adds that it’s no longer enough to rely solely on a solid business strategy, an excellent product or service, talented and dedicated employees and a rock star sales and marketing team. “You may be doing all these things right, but if you don’t stand out, you lose,” she told IBD.Tips on making your company’s presence known:Know your purpose. A company must define what it stands for and stay true to that belief, Lee said. “The brand must be consistently communicated on all channels, internally and externally.”Make a visual statement. First impressions matter. The outward appearance of the brand truly reflects what the organization is and the value it delivers, Hart says.Lee suggests building your brand equity: “the image, personality, name recognition, identity, reputation and positive attitudes associated with a company and its products.”Strive for authenticity. Your organization’s messaging should be “consistent, true, genuine and communicate primary and secondary value propositions in all communications,” Hart said.Makes sure to share and update it continuously, Lee adds. Maintain a monthly messaging strategy and editorial calendar.Separate yourself. Hart shares a Forbes report that 8 of 10 businesses fail due to no differentiation in the marketplace.According to Walker Smith, executive chairman of Futures Co., the biggest problem with marketing is advertising clutter.“If we focus on what makes each of us distinct, prospects would not be confused by everything looking the same,” Hart said.Get the right people. A company’s success on things like standing out is largely predicated on the skills of its leadership team. Leaders are made, not born, reminds Rick Tiemann, author of “Developing World Class Leaders: The Ultimate Guide to Leadership Development.”“Today’s leaders cannot be one-dimensional or depend on any one style of leadership to achieve goals,” he said. “They must develop a broader range of skills and understand how their competencies and behaviors link together.”Unify. With company initiatives, everything starts at the top and is reinforced from there, Tiemann said: “If the program is not driven from the top, it is probably not going to be taken very seriously. To adopt this as a strategic corporate initiative is imperative.”Follow up regularly. If company initiatives have no one holding the staff accountable for their development and implementation, nothing is likely to happen, Tiemann says.Evaluate the marketplace. Be vigilant on this. What is standing out one day may be obsolete the next.Great firms such as Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Toyota (TM) adapt their game plans and investment plays based on changes, says Bruce Piasecki, author of “New World Companies.”“That is why Toyota sells millions of hybrid power trains, why Ingersoll Rand moves more food than any with superefficient refrigeration units,” he said. Measure. Lee and Hart share that Interbrand, a top brand consultant, has developed a brand valuation model that has become certified by the International Organization for Standardization.Interbrand’s ranking and valuation of the world’s top brands is based on a combination of attributes contributing to a brand’s cumulative value, Lee says. Among them:“Regardless of the methods used, all researchers agree that strong, well-leveraged brands produce higher returns to shareholders than weaker, less well-known brands,” Hart said. “This means that brand and brand awareness have the potential to positively impact shareholder value and future sales.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

218,IR,"Bank of Ireland (IRE), the country's biggest lender, is up 28% this year through Friday. Fitch's upgraded the bank in January. Moody's downgraded it in December. Analysts on consensus forecast the bank will exit five years of net losses and turn a profit in 2014.At the start of this year, Ireland's stock markets were worth about half of what they were at the end of 2006, according to Credit Suisse. In 2007, Ireland was the European Union's second wealthiest country in GDP per capita, and the fifth richest in the world.That changed abruptly with the global economic train wreck, as Ireland's concentrated leverage in real estate and financials left the country in need of EU support. However, Ireland was the first country to exit the eurozone bailout program, stepping out from the financial support in mid-December with an economy that is smaller, but more diversified.The iShares MSCI Ireland (EIRL) ETF is up 7% year to date, ahead of ETFs for Germany, France and the overall U.K., not to mention the Nasdaq and S&P 500.Medical and drug companies have expanded to become one of the country's strong suits.Just two of the bright points in that sector are Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) and new issue Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (MNK), both up more than 25% since Dec. 31.Jazz has been a clear star, ahead 6% in February after advancing in nine of 10 recent months.

290,IR,"Don't mistake $1.2 billion Fidelity Trend's approach as a growth-at-a-reasonable-price fund.Manager Dan Kelley prefers to describe his fund as looking for companies whose growth is underestimated by Wall Street analysts.Kelley favors three types of growth stocks:Stable earnings growers.Companies on a hot streak, with high sustainable growth for many years.Opportunistic growers, which have low valuations but are near a point when a catalyst sparks a growth spurt.Google (GOOG), Monsanto (MON) and Visa (V) are examples of stable growers. Michael Kors (KORS) is in his high sustainable growth bucket, as he puts it.  Manitowoc (MTW), new to the fund as of its latest disclosure, and United Technologies (UTX) are opportunistic growers.Those latter two stocks benefit from the rally in nonresidential construction, Kelley says. Manitowoc sells cranes and lifting equipment. United sells elevators and heating systems.Other holdings also sell into the construction space.  Ingersoll-Rand (IR) makes climate control systems. Wesco (WCC) distributes industrial and electrical construction, maintenance, repair and operating supplies. Vulcan Materials (VMC) makes construction aggregates.""Nonresidential construction tends to lag residential by 12 to 18 months, so this space is right in a sweet spot,"" Kelley said.The ongoing rebound in residential housing benefits materials and tools sellers. The fund held Lowes (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) as of its latest disclosure.""As home sales improve, people feel more comfortable adding or refurbishing rooms or taking care of deferred repairs in existing homes too,"" Kelley said.Kelley's CredentialsThose areas are familiar to Kelley. Before taking the reins of Trend in January last year, at various times he has served as research analyst covering REITs and homebuilder stocks as well as manager of Select Construction & Housing along with other duties. He now runs four portfolios in all.Another trend Kelley has played is refurbished auto parts.

"
331,IR,"Everett adopted the name Maulana Karenga, began teaching African studies in California and said he founded the holiday to ""give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.""
"

"

Jeremiah Wright, whose racist, anti-American, anti-Semitic sermons caught on videotape shocked many Americans.
"
335,IR,"Obama said he did not recall hearing such rants in the church where he was married and his daughters were baptized. In an ensuing speech on race, Obama said he could no more renounce Wright than his white grandmother whom Obama said he'd heard make racist remarks.

"
337,IR,"In his 2012 book ""The Amateur,"" the best-selling author Edward Klein quotes Wright as saying that when Obama joined his church, the newcomer was ignorant of Christianity and required considerable tutoring.

360,IR,"Stocks mounted a comeback attempt in afternoon trade Friday, but still remained under the break-even point.The Nasdaq was down 0.4% after being off as much as 1%. The S&P 500 and the NYSE composite were down 0.4% and 0.5% respectively. Volume was up sharply on the NYSE and down narrowly on the Nasdaq. Today is an options expiration day, which typically fires up volume.The laggard gold-mining industry group was among the top performers. Randgold Resources (GOLD) rose 2% in 48% quicker action. But the explorer isn't a top-rated stock. Randgold is 26% off its 52-week high and is under its 50-day moving average. Not one gold stock can claim a Composite Rating of at least 90.The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is in the top 10 percentile.Hibbett Sports (HIBB) leapt 4% in more than triple its usual volume. The company reported quarterly results that topped the Street's numbers on earnings and sales. Earlier this month, the stock sketched a handle in a cup base but, then doodled on its chart for almost two weeks, unable to find aggressive volume or clear direction. Today, it popped past the 38.43 buy point.The stock has a respectable 79 Composite Rating, putting it ahead almost 80% of the market.On the downside, industrial play Nordson (NDSN) sank 5% in heavy volume. The stock gapped up 4% in fast trade Thursday, but wasn't able to retake its 50-day line. That line was converted from support into resistance earlier this month.Nordson's Machinery-General Industrial group is highly rated. As of Friday's IBD, it was No. 13 of 197 industry groups. Other stocks in the group appear to be finding support at or above the 50-day line. They include Gardner Denver (GDI), Graco (GGG), Sun Hydraulics (SNHY), Idex (IEX), Gorman-Rupp (GRC) and  Ingersoll-Rand (IR).If the market should turn to a confirmed uptrend, this industrial group could be a place to scout for stocks.

361,IR,"With first-quarter earnings drawing to a close, industry peers are doing various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector — Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report) and IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetRegal Beloit reported decent first-quarter 2018 results, supported by strong organic sales growth and favorable foreign currency translation impact. On a GAAP basis, the industrial goods manufacturer reported net income of $58.4 million or $1.31 per share compared with $46.3 million or $1.02 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher revenues across segments. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.34 per share compared with $1.07 in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. Net sales increased to $878.8 million from $813.5 million in the year-earlier quarter, driven by strong organic sales growth across all three operating segments. Moreover, quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $867 million.IDEX reported strong first-quarter results with all-time high revenues, operating income and earnings driven by healthy organic growth and diligent execution of operational plans. GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $99 million or $1.27 per share compared with $75.9 million or 99 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to top-line growth. Excluding restructuring and other non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.29 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. Net sales came in at $612.3 million compared with $553.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $601 million. The top-line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 7%. Investments in product innovations, business development and reallocation of resources led to growth in revenues across all segments of the company, which helped drive total revenues.Based on first-quarter earnings, there appears to be no clear favorite as Regal Beloit has an edge over IDEX with respect to earnings surprise percentage, while it is just the opposite with respect to revenue surprise percentage.Price PerformanceOver the past month, Regal Beloit has outperformed IDEX with an average return of 8.7% against a loss of 3.1% for the latter while the sector declined 1.7%. Based on the price performance, Regal Beloit appears to be a clear winner. Zacks Rank & VGM ScoreWith a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Regal Beloit has a Value Growth Momentum score (VGM Score) of A. IDEX has a VGM Score of D and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Consequently, Regal Beloit appears to be better positioned than IDEX with regards to this metric.Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Regal Beloit’s current-quarter estimates increased from $1.49 to $1.52 per share (up 2%) while that for the current year increased from $5.57 to $5.66 (up 1.6%).IDEX’s current-quarter estimates increased to $1.31 from $1.29 post earnings release (up 1.6%) while current-year estimates increased to $5.18 per share from $5.07 (up 2.2%). With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Regal Beloit than IDEX with respect to current-quarter estimates but just the opposite for current-year estimates.GuidanceFor 2018, Regal Beloit raised its adjusted earnings per share to $5.60-$6.00 from $5.35-$5.75 expected earlier. It expects the Nicotra Gebhardt acquisition to be 13-15 cents accretive to adjusted earnings in 2018. The company projects GAAP earnings per share between $5.29 and $5.69, up from prior expectations of $5.19-$5.59.IDEX is poised to gain from robust organic growth, disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment. With solid quarterly results and continued strength in order trajectory, management has raised its earlier guidance for 2018. Full-year adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $5.05-$5.20 per share range, up from $4.90-$5.10 expected earlier on organic growth of 5-6%.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although the two stocks seem to match each other on most counts, Regal Beloit appears to have trumped IDEX on few metrics and stands out as a better investment proposition. A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the industry are Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) and A. O.

364,IR,"Accelerating growth of the global economy, from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017, had been a propeller for many countries, both advanced and emerging, including the United States. Over the two years (2016-2017), the country’s major stock indexes – S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq – have surged 30.8%, 41.9% and 37.9%, respectively. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded roughly 1.5% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017.The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) growth projections are also encouraging. In its January 2018 report, the IMF predicted that the global output will expand 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019. The U.S. economy is projected to grow 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. These estimates reflect an improvement of 0.4% for 2018 and 0.6% for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts.Our in-house projections indicate roughly 18% growth in earnings and a 5.6% increase in revenues for the S&P 500 companies in 2018. The earnings projection compares favorably with a growth rate of 9.7% recorded in 2017.We believe that advancement in the global economy and a strengthening domestic market will prove beneficial for demand of industrial machinery. Technological advancement in agriculture and mining industries will require upgraded farming and mining machineries, while growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations will raise need for highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, the need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces will raise the demand for heavy construction machinery.Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery by NationThe United States: Many factors are currently working in favor of industrial machinery companies here. Encouraging job data, with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in February versus 4.7% in the year-ago month, infrastructural improvement plans of the government and strengthening housing markets are some tailwinds.Some other key economic indicators are pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. The country’s industrial production grew 4.4% year over year in February. This marked the highest increase on a year-over-year basis since March 2011. Mining sector expanded 9.7%, utilities 10.5% and manufacturing 2.5%.Also, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery in January 2018 grew 11.4% year over year while the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February expanded 1.7 percentage points from the previous month. The improvement in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector — the key highlights being healthier business conditions, favorable export orders and production, solid backlog and employment growth.Also, the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 lowered taxes for many corporations, enabling them to invest the free resources in growth projects. However, the government’s tariff imposition on import of steel and aluminum jolted the market somewhat, with fears of possible increase in competitive threats from international players, hike in production costs and retaliatory measures by affected nations.Japan: The country’s economy is still struggling with internal issues, including an aging population and a huge public debt.However, strengthening exports driven by a rise in automobile shipments, improvements in domestic demand induced by healthy growth in private investments and improving employment and wage rates will be beneficial. The country’s GDP grew 1.5% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while registering a 0.5% rise over the previous quarter.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 8.2% in January 2018. However, this is predicted to decline 1.5% in the first quarter of 2018 while total machinery orders are predicted to fall 6.9%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.2% for 2018 and by 10 bps to 0.9% for 2019.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while it expanded 6.9% in 2017, higher than the government’s target of 6.5%. Healthy export demand, flexible property market and rising manufacturing activities were the prime growth drivers.The country’s industrial production improved 7.2% year over year in both January and February 2018. Electricity, gas and water production as well as manufacturing sectors flourished while the mining recovered during the period.For 2018, the government of China anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that robust investment for the development of infrastructure and transportation will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery. Also, the country’s efforts to lower its debt burden will be advantageous. However, the possibilities of a trade war with the United States, triggered by its imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium, might be a concerning factor for the both the countries’ trade relations.The IMF projects economy of China to grow 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country’s major economic decisions — including demonetization and goods and services tax — along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth. Also, favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production grew 7.5% year over year in January 2018 versus a 7.1% gain recorded in December. Manufacturing output expanded 8.7%, electricity production jumped 7.6% while mere 0.1% growth was registered in mining.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.4% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2019.Brazil: The country is grappling with uncertainties on the political front that has over time adversely affected the country’s growth opportunities. General elections are due this October with high probability of abandoned initiatives to reform the country’s pension system becoming a major topic of discussion. Moreover, inadequate infrastructure and a still high unemployment rate of 12.6% (in three months ended February 2018) are other major hurdles.Partially negating these, growth in export demand, strengthening spending in the housing markets and rise in consumer confidence are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation has prompted the country’s Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered 25 bps in March 2018, this being its 10th consecutive rate cut since 2017. The country’s GDP in 2017 grew 1% after 3.5% decline in both 2015 and 2016 and is predicted to grow 3% in 2018.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging, with year-over-year growth of 5.7% recorded for January 2018. This compares favorably with 4.5% growth in December 2017 and 4.7% in November 2017.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 1.9% in 2018, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projections for 2019 have been increased 10 bps to 2.1%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing improvements in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP improved 2.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 while advanced 2.3% in 2017. Industrial production improved 2.7% year over year in January 2018.The unemployment rate was 8.6% in January 2018, down from 9.6% in the year-ago month but stable compared with December.The IMF raised output growth estimates by 30 bps both for 2018 and 2019 to 2.2% and 2%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingIndustrial machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. It currently occupies the second position in the Zacks sectors list.Of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors, those in the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) have higher chances of beating the bottom half (i.e., the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)We believe that investors keen on exposure to industrial machinery companies have reasons to rejoice. Machinery industries with their positions are as follows: electrical products is in the top 2% of the 265 industries while construction and mining equipment is in the top 6%, farm equipment in the top 36% and thermal products in the top 49%.Also, companies dealing in electronics are in the top 15%, material handling products in the top 5%, industrial tools and providing related services is in the top 29% and companies serving general industrial purposes are in the 42%. However, companies dealing in printing equipment for industrial use are in the bottom half at 95%.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorIn the past five years, the Industrial Products sector has yielded a solid 35.4% return.In the fourth quarter of 2017, earnings of Industrial Products grew 34.8% year over year, while revenues improved 14.5%. The earnings and sales growth was above 19.6% growth in earnings and 4.8% rise in revenues in the third quarter.Our in-house projections, published in the Earnings Trends report dated Mar 23, indicate roughly 19.6% growth in earnings and 8.2% increase in revenues of Industrial Products sector in 2018. Margins are likely to expand roughly 1%. Growth for earnings and margins is higher than 18.7% and 0.46%, respectively, recorded in 2017, while that for revenues is below 2017-figure of 12.9%.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%.Our TakeInternal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in further accelerating growth.It will be interesting to watch the activities of industrial machinery companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar Inc.

366,IR,"The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently raised its outlook for the global economy, with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3.6% in 2017. It expects 2.2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.7% in 2018, including 2% growth for advanced nations and 4.9% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery. Moreover, healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations, especially in emerging countries, are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces require heavy construction machineries.Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector has performed well, yielding a solid return of 18.3% year to date. This outpaces growth of 16.9% recorded by the S&P 500 and roughly 13.2% by the NYSE Composite.Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corp., PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial Machinery: DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.The United States: The country’s industrial production increased2.9% year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining, manufacturing and utilities output. In September, industrial production increased 1.6% year over year.In addition, a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report,new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 6.4% in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries.Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 261,000 new job additions in October. Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162,000 (accounting for hurricane affects). The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points (bps) to 4.1%. Also, the country’s GDP has advanced 3% in the July-September quarter.We believe that implementation of the Trump government’s growth policies, especially the proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country. To continue supporting the growing economy, the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December.The IMF projects the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018. These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018.Japan: The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, an aging population and huge public debt.Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in April 2014.However, strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country’s annualized GDP growth of 1.4% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter. In addition, we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 4.7% in third-quarter 2017. However, the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter, with total machinery orders likely to decline 1.9%. Core orders are expected to fall 3.5%, orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9.4% and that from government clients might decline 3.3%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1.5% for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0.7% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% from the year-earlier period in the third quarter. However, this improvement was slightly below 6.9% registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments.The country’s industrial production improved 6.6% year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in October grew 6.2%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that implementation of the government’s plan to spend more than $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery.The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.8% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2018, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country is currently witnessing the after-effects of some major reforms —demonetization and goods and services tax — implemented in the trailing 12 months. These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward.A favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production decelerated to 3.8% in September 2017, having expanded 4.5% in the previous month. Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs. In the first half of fiscal 2017 (ended September), industrial production expanded 2.5% year over year.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 7.4% in 2018, down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates.Brazil: One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation, somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities. Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country’s poor investment grade ratings. Moreover, low private investments, inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12.4% are other major hurdles.Partially negating the impact of these aspects, growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation have prompted the countries’ Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October, this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year. Per the latest data, industrial production in September grew 2.6% from the year-ago comparable month.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.7% in 2017, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1.5%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP has improved 2.5% year over year in third-quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3.3% year over year in September. The unemployment rate at September end was 8.9% versus 9% at the end of the previous month.The region’s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0.6% versus 0.7% recorded in the second quarter. Industrial production, on a month-on-month basis, fell 0.6% in September.The IMF increased output growth estimates by 20 bps both for 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingOf the 16 Zacks sector, Industrial Products is currently in the top 25%, holding the fourth position. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry.

370,IR,"The U.S. market showed strength subsequent to the election of President Trump, primarily factoring in his promised pro-growth policies. However, the momentum has stalled following uncertainties looming over policy enactment and implementation.As far the Industrial Products companies are concerned, the Trump government’s infrastructure improvement plan, if implemented, will boost demand. Also, the sector is seeing improving export demand for its products from foreign nations.Since the beginning of the year, industrial products stocks have been strong performers, with the sector gaining roughly 9.4%. Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers include Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery - Nation-Wise DescriptionThe United States: The country’s industrial production increased at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities.Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 5.7% in the first half of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries. Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 209,000 new job additions in July. In second-quarter 2017, new job additions averaged 194,333 per month. Unemployment rate declined from 4.4% in June to 4.3% in July.Citing improvement in economic activities, the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates in June and indicated further rate hikes ahead. This, in turn, will make capital investments more expensive and hence might weigh on businesses for industrial products makers.     Per its Jul 2017 report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimmed its growth projections for the U.S. economy by 20 basis points (bps) to 2.1% for 2017 and 40 bps to 2.1% for 2018 primarily on account of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of governmental policies.Japan: According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months) decreased 1.4% in first-quarter 2017 while fell nearly 3.1% in April and 3.6% in May.  In second-quarter 2017, total machinery order will likely decline 0.9% while core orders are expected to fall 5.9%. Orders from manufacturing clients will likely fall 1.1% while that from government clients might decline 13.6%.The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, unfavorable exchange rates, aging population and a huge public debt. Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015.In addition, the country is facing weak economic conditions externally. However, efforts to improve wages and hence, demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 10 bps to 1.3% for 2017 while it remained stable at 0.6% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.9% from the year-earlier period in the second quarter, coming in better than expected. Improvements in infrastructure investment, retail sales and higher exports due to healthy global economy have worked in its favor. In March, the government announced its plan to spend $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020. However, tiff with the U.S. economy over trade relationships might dent its growth momentum.The country’s industrial production increased 7.6% year over year in June on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in both May and April grew 6.5%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018.India: The country’s industrial production decelerated to 1.7% in May 2017, having expanded 2.8% in the previous month. Production suffered from lower rise in manufacturing output and contractions in mining and quarrying outputs.Expectations of a strong demand, improved policies and better monsoon conditions are the factors that will influence the country’s growth, going forward. The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world. Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country, these strategies will improve the domestic job market as well as demand for industrial products. The recent interest rate cut by the central bank, driven by prevailing low inflation rate in the country, will allow accessibility to cheap loans.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.2% in 2017 and 7.7% in 2018.Brazil: Political uncertainties continue to loom large over Brazil’s economy and are mainly responsible for the countries’ below investment grade ratings. Private investments are low while inadequate infrastructure and still high unemployment rate are making the economy more lackluster.Strong efforts are being made to revive the economy. In July this year, interest rate was trimmed 100 bps by the countries’ Central Bank, this being its seventh consecutive rate cut since Oct 2016. Also, inflation has eased over the past few months. Per the data available, industrial production in the country was flat in Jun 2017 compared with the previous month while showed expansion of 1.2% in May and 1.3% in April.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.3% in 2017, reflecting a 10 bps increase from the previous forecast. However, growth projection for 2018 has been cut 40 bps to 1.3%.Eurozone: Per the available data, industrial production in the Eurozone improved 1.3% in May from the prior month and rose 4% year over year. In April, industrial production inched up 0.3% from the previous month. The unemployment rate was 9.1% in June versus 9.2% in the previous month.The IMF predicts output growth in Euro Area to be 1.9% in 2017, up 20 bps from the previous forecasts and grow 1.7% in 2018.Industry RankingMachinery stocks are broadly grouped under the Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank).The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipments (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rank of 19), construction and mining equipment (ranked 19), industrial electronics (ranked 96), electrical products (ranked 117), thermal products (ranked 53), material handling products (ranked 53), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 117) and industrial tools and equipment, and providing related services are collectively ranked 117.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Earnings Preview dated Aug 4, the earnings season has unfolded well. As of that date, roughly 420 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the April-June quarter, with 74.3% beating earnings estimates and 68.3% surpassing revenue projections.Of Industrial Products stocks, roughly 91.7% reported results til Aug 4. Earnings beat recorded as of that date was 68.2% while revenue beat was 54.5%.In the quarter, the market is anticipated to perform well, witnessing earnings and sales growth of 10% and 5.1%, respectively over the year-ago quarter. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging.   ConclusionThe IMF anticipates the world economy to grow 3.5% in 2017. It expects 2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.6% in 2018, including 1.9% growth for advanced nations and 4.8% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that policies encouraging better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand might accelerate growth in the U.S. economy. This, in turn, will prove beneficial for industrial machinery stocks. It will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp.

(GGG  -  Free Report) stock to your portfolio at the moment will be a promising investment move.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and its earnings per share are predicted to grow by 10.3% in the next three to five years.What’s Driving Graco’s Growth Prospects?The upsurge in the U.S. manufacturing sector will likely prove beneficial for Graco, as the company generates almost 60% revenues from this domain. Production and new order numbers are shoring up in the United States, on account of tailwinds like lower corporate taxes, increased public spending and rising oil prices. Going forward, expedited investments in factories, new equipment and other capital goods will likely spur demand for Graco’s products.Graco’s top line has been improving for the past two years, as evident from a 3.3% year-over-year growth in 2016 and 10.9% in 2017.

374,IR,"On May 25, we issued an updated research report on premium industrial goods firm, RBC Bearings Inc. (ROLL  -  Free Report).The company intends to become the leading provider of precision engineered components and bearings in the market. In sync with this, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company acquires potential businesses, enlarges its customer base, deploys capital for innovation investments and expands business in new end-markets.The company believes robust industrial original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) demand, and higher industrial distribution and aftermarket sales will drive its industrial sales in the quarters ahead. In addition, elevated Aero OEM’s demand and augmented build rates of single-aisle planes are expected to bolster the company’s aerospace revenues. Notably, RBC Bearings currently anticipates to report revenues in the range of $172-$175 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018).Per our estimates, the stock’s projected year-over-year sales growth for fiscal 2019 is currently pegged at 9.1%.RBC Bearings has been strengthening its bottom-line performance on the back of higher revenues and wider margins. Cost-reduction initiatives, consolidation programs and production-process improvements are expected to aid in widening the company’s margins in the upcoming quarters. Also, we believe lower corporate tax rates will help boost the company’s profitability, going forward.Per our estimates, the stock’s projected year-over-year earnings growth for fiscal 2019 is currently pegged at 19.8%.Furthermore, RBC Bearings has been improving its liquidity on the back of increased cash generation for the past few quarters. The company intends to lower its debt burden, fund new growth-oriented investments and provide higher returns to shareholders with these proceeds.Over the past month, RBC Bearings’ shares have rallied 4.4%, outperforming 1.9% growth recorded by the industry.However, Overseas business expansion exposes RBC Bearings to risks associated with adverse foreign currency translation. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the currencies of other international markets, such as Canada and Europe, has been hurting the company’s top-line performance for the past few quarters.Unfavorable foreign currency-translation impact dragged down the company’s net sales by 11% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The company believes fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates will continue to weigh over its revenues even in the quarters ahead.Also, on a Price/Earnings (TTM) basis, RBC Bearings’ shares look overvalued compared with the industry, with the respective tallies of 33.7x and 22.6x for the last three months. Notably, the stock is currently trading higher than the median P/E (TTM) range.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

376,IR,"Ireland, the fastest growing economy of the European Union, has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. The Irish labor market remains tight currently as its unemployment is near a 10-year low. Also, the EU has been upbeat about the growth prospects of the Irish economy in the years to come.Finally, business conditions have kept improving and Irish wages have been boosted by tight labor conditions. Such favorable conditions call for investing in stocks from Ireland.Unemployment at a 10-year LowFor the first time in as many as 10 years, the overall jobless rate in Ireland swooned to below 6% in April. Per the latest report from the Central Statistics Office on May 1, the unemployment rate fell to 5.9%. The metric was last around this level in 2008, just before Ireland’s economic crisis.The jobless rate has been on a steady decline since the country’s finance department projected in April that by the next year, the Irish economy would witness the unemployment rate falling to as low as 5.3%. The body also stated that after this, joblessness would hold steady at that level till 2020, while the economy makes its way to full employment.Coming to the statistics, the seasonally adjusted rate for the current level of unemployment fell even below the revised rate of 6% in the month before and 6.8% in April last year. The total number of persons who were left unemployed within Ireland stood at 140,300, lower than 143,500 persons in the month earlier. Also, in the past 12 months, 16,700 persons got jobs.Irish Manufacturing Activity Gains TractionManufacturing activity in the European country gained momentum in April after a period of lull in March due to weather-related disruptions. Last month, a snowstorm in Ireland — the ugliest in last 36 years — forced the closure of business activity across the country. This led to Purchasing Managers' Index falling to 54.1% in March, its 12-month low.However, post resumption of business in the country in April, the Investec factory Purchasing Managers' Index surged to 55.3%. Further, business conditions within the Irish economy have steadily improved for the last 59 months. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion.EU Raises Its Growth Forecast on IrelandIn its Spring 2018 European Economic Forecast, the European Union (EU) raised its growth forecast for the Irish economy. The body stated that the country would continue to experience strong GDP growth in the next two years.The commission remained upbeat on the prospects of the Irish economy and forecast that in 2018, Ireland’s GDP will surge 5.7% and 4.1% in 2019. Such growth would be achieved on the back of a rise in household spending boosted by an increase in wages. Further, continued investment in construction would also ensure that the economy remains robust in the years to come. Rising employment would drive wages higher and low levels of inflation would boost consumer spending.4 Best ChoicesIreland’s unemployment rate has fallen to a 10-year low even as the economy keeps growing consistently. This indicates that the country would remain EU’s fastest growing economy for some time to come. Further, manufacturing activity in the country has also gathered steam in the last month. Finally, business conditions have kept on improving for almost 60 months on the trot. Such favorable conditions make Ireland’s stocks a hotbed for money.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These five stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

377,IR,"Making its debut on 04/02/2007, smart beta exchange traded fund Guggenheim Mid-Cap Core ETF (CZA  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexCZA is managed by Invesco Powershares, and this fund has amassed over $253.11 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Mid Cap ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Mid-Cap Core Index.The Zacks Mid-Cap Core Index is comprised of 100 securities selected, based on investment and other criteria, from a universe of mid-capitalization securities including master limited partnerships and American depositary receipts.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.65% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.CZA's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.11%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 32.60% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector; Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Keycorp (KEY  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.14% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) and Regions Financial Corp (RF  -  Free Report).CZA's top 10 holdings account for about 19.92% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.02%, and was up about 11.66% in the last one year (as of 05/05/2018). CZA has traded between $57.99 and $68.99 in the past 52-week period.CZA has a beta of 0.92 and standard deviation of 13.09% for the trailing three-year period.

385,IR,"The earnings season is off to a solid start with decent performance across the table. About 133 S&P 500 members have already released their results till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations.

This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data, which in turn boosted corporate earnings, stoked investments and trickled down to employees in some instances. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.The Industrial Products sector appears to be quite strong. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 29.5% year over year while sales are touted to rise 13.7% due to higher investments for infrastructure development.Let’s take a sneak peek at four major Industrial stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Johnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.

387,IR,"Industrial goods manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 25. The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.This, in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesIngersoll continues to reposition its portfolio to focus on high-barrier markets. While such efforts are encouraging, they involve upfront costs, which might lead to earnings dilution in the near term. Consequently, the company is continually under stress to maintain profitability through stringent cost-cutting measures.In addition, when the economy in Europe is highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. In addition, Ingersoll is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial Technologies segment revenues is currently pegged at $729 million, down from $765 million reported in the second quarter. Revenues from Climate Control Technologies are also expected to be $2,992 million compared with reported revenues of $3,144 million in the prior quarter.Other Key FactorsOperating income for Industrial Technologies ad Climate Control Technologies segments are expected to be $88 million and $505 million, respectively, compared with the corresponding tallies of $92 million and $527 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Ingersoll is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.20%.

While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Franklin Resources, Inc.
