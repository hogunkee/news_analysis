5,MAR,"In the past 12 months, the Big Cap 20 and a ""buy high"" strategy could've made the individual investor some nice profits. A look at how success unfolded could help the next time around.Few stocks have done better than PayPal (PYPL) in price performance. A year ago, the Big Cap 20 stock was too extended to buy. Some individual investors might've wondered about that.If the stock is too high to buy, why should it appear in the Big Cap 20? The question points to two misunderstandings. First, the Big Cap 20 is more of a watch list than a buy list. Second, ""too high to buy"" suggests the IBD-style investor is looking for bargains. Not so.An IBD investor would rather buy a stock at a higher price that is likely to work than a lower price that is unlikely to work. While that sounds counterintuitive, it's a sound strategy.In PayPal's case, the stock was extended in late May 2017 when it appeared on the Big Cap 20. But a patient investor was able to act on a valid buy point in mid-July. The stock crossed above a 55.24 buy point in a second-stage flat base and rose 42% in 20 weeks.That's how the IBD-style investor likes to make money.Let's look at some additional Big Cap 20 success stories from the year-ago lineup.Hotel chain Marriott International (MAR) was extended. The stock began to consolidate in early June. By mid-September, it had sketched a double-bottom base with a 107.73 buy point. Marriott broke out Sept. 20 in heavy volume.From there, Marriott rose 38% in 19 weeks.Chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) was extended. The stock began to consolidate in early June. Lam formed a cup-without-handle that went nowhere. A second side-by-side cup with handle led to a mid-September breakout. The stock cleared a 169.25 entry and advanced 29% in 11 weeks.Another chip-equipment maker, Applied Materials (AMAT), also consolidated in early June. The stock completed a cup-with-handle pattern over more than three months. Applied Materials broke out in mid-September. The stock rose 27% in 10 weeks.The two chip stocks succeeded despite being late-stage bases. Three factors may have helped the stocks overcome the odds.First, the chip sector was ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors. Second, the chip-equipment group was No. 18 among 197 groups. Third, the market was in the midst of a confirmed rally that would last 112 sessions.Nvidia (NVDA), a chip designer, was extended in May 2017. The stock broke out of a stage-two base in mid-September. Nvidia cleared a 174.66 entry.In nine weeks, Nvidia rose 25%.In each of these five cases, waiting to buy higher worked.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Raises Price Target On Apple StockBest Buy Gaps Down, Loses 50-Day Line16 Steps To Turn $15.26 Into $1 MillionMarketSmith: Four Weeks For $29.95

8,MAR,"Will the current creep up in interest rates slow demand in the vacation-resort time share market? One executive answers an emphatic, ""No.""Mike Flaskey, CEO of Diamond Resorts, says his firm is ""very bullish"" and aims to keep expanding in hot leisure destinations such as Hawaii. One piece of proof: the company's recent $225 million purchase of The Modern Honolulu in Oahu.Diamond will upgrade it to meet customers' demands for luxury-style suite accommodations that feature full-size kitchens and one- or two-bedroom formats.""It's a four-star property. We're going to go through it floor by floor,"" Flaskey told IBD during an interview Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.Flaskey said that Diamond Resorts generates roughly $100 million in annual sales centered on its collection of membership-based hotels across the entire Hawaiian isles. While Las Vegas is Diamond's top sales market, Flaskey believes Hawaii will in time take the top spot.One leg of Diamond's business is financing the purchase of customers' points-based time share ownership. Flaskey says the typical customer makes a 15% down payment on an average transaction of $24,000. Then he or she borrows to pay off the rest via a loan from Diamond.""Middle America is our customer. The usual household income is between $110,000 and $140,000,"" Flaskey said. ""They are very comfortable with making a regular payment"" to fund the buy. Plus, 30% of Diamond's customers pay off the outstanding loan before maturity.Flaskey's bullish sentiment dovetails with the rising fortunes in recent years among publicly traded hotel companies.The lodging industry veteran foresees the total public market value of timeshare-oriented companies rising to nearly $37 billion within a couple of years. That's up nearly fourfold since the fall of 2013, when Diamond Resorts and competitor Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) totaled less than $10 billion in market cap.Marriott Vacations fell more than 8% in big volume Monday.

12,MAR,"It's time to give Facebook's stock some credit.After a data privacy scandal knocked shares of Facebook (FB) for a loop in March, it's recovered in spades — so much so that on Thursday the stock made a breakout from a first-stage base.Facebook's chart is compelling. It recently cleared a double-bottom entry of 186.20, but the breakout was in light volume. Facebook recently added a handle area to its base, presenting an alternate entry of 188.42.It's not often that a former leader hit hard by institutional selling is able to come back, especially after a lengthy price run. Shares of Facebook hit an intraday high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, good for a gain of more than 400% since its May 2012 debut at 38. It closed at 38.23 on its first day of trading.So far, Facebook stock is proving its mettle.Even better, Facebook's price performance since a breakout from a base in late January 2017 offers a great illustration of why IBD rules for buying and selling are always prudent to follow.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base breakout in early 2017 wasn't perfect but still worked well and ended up being a perfect entry point.It cleared a first-stage cup-with-handle base during the week ended Jan. 27 in higher volume (1). The buy point at the time was 129.37. The breakout reinforced a steadfast IBD rule that says to buy stocks breaking out of bases when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. That was the case at the time.The base was first stage because the low of the base undercut the low of a flat base that formed a couple of months earlier. That served to reset the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more upside.But Facebook showed less-than-ideal price action the very next week when shares reversed lower in higher weekly volume. It was a sign of institutional selling — not good to see so soon after a breakout. But no sell signal was triggered as the stock held above the buy point and its 10-week moving average.Over the next several months, Facebook rode its 10-week moving average (drawn in red in the accompanying chart) higher (2). It didn't take long for the stock to trigger an IBD profit-taking rule that says to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it. Why? Because that's typically the time a stock starts to pull back and consolidate gains after a breakout.In early August, Facebook started to take a breather but didn't correct much off highs. A flat base eventually formed with a 175.59 buy point (3), but Facebook had a hard time breaking out. It rallied 4.9% before settling into a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. It rallied nearly 6% from the second breakout before settling into its current pattern.Big sellers were in Facebook in the week ended Feb. 9. Shares plunged 7.5% in higher volume, giving up support at the 10-week moving average. It rallied for a bit before plunging again during the week end Mar. 23. That was around the time of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.But it didn't take long for Facebook to recover as Wall Street placed bets that the company would live to see another day without a meaningful hit to earnings and sales.Shares of Facebook gapped up April 26 on bullish Q1 earnings. Investors were also cheered by a boost in daily user growth to 1.45 billion.RELATED:How The Correct Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityThe Ins And Outs Of A Double-Bottom BaseFacebook Will Reorganize Into Three Divisions, Plans Blockchain GroupGlobal Stock LeadersWhich Companies Are New To Key IBD Growth Stock Screens?

13,MAR,"Politics: Before President Trump even took the oath of office, constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe was calling for his impeachment. Tribe hasn't stopped since. But 20 years ago, Tribe was singing a different tune about impeachment when a lawbreaking Democrat was in the White House.In early December, less than a month after Trump won the election, Tribe tweeted that impeachment should begin ""on Inauguration Day.""Eight days after Inauguration Day, Tribe declared that Trump was already guilty of ""shredding the Constitution more monstrously than any other President in American history.""He's since claimed Trump should be impeached and removed from office for his ""cruel brand of bigotry and scapegoating,"" for ""falsely"" claiming that the Obama administration wiretapped his campaign, for a State Department blog post on Mar-a-Lago. Most recently, Trump should be removed for the simple reason that we don't like ""what kind of nation will we have become"" should he stay in office.Now Tribe has written what looks like an ""Impeachment for Dummies"" guide should Democrats regain control of the House next year called ""To End A Presidency: The Power Of Impeachment.""In it, and in an Op-Ed in USA Today, Tribe argues that even if Trump hasn't broken any laws doesn't mean he shouldn't be impeached.""Criminal law is not a comprehensive list of acts that might imperil democracy if committed by the president,"" he writes in his Op-Ed. That's a fair point.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut it was the same Tribe who just 20 years ago was arguing that even though President Clinton had broken the law by perjuring himself, he shouldn't be removed from office.To make his argument against impeaching Clinton, Tribe ""nearly threw his back out trying to raise the constitutional bar for removal,"" the Cato Institute's Gene Healy aptly put it.In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in 1998, Tribe argued that for an offense to be impeachable, it had to ""severely threaten the system of government or constitute a grievous abuse of official power or both.""""Back then even murder was a close call in Tribe's eyes, if the president did the deed himself, for personal reasons,"" Healy notes, pointing to passages from Tribe's testimony, in which Tribe explains how Aaron Burr wasn't impeached after he killed Alexander Hamilton.Tribe argued that Clinton's committing perjury wasn't impeachable because, basically, he was lying about a private matter. In this case, having sex with an intern in the Oval Office.But even if what Clinton did was impeachable, Tribe seems to think he shouldn't have been removed.In his book, Tribe quotes approvingly from a speech given by then-Sen. Robert Byrd on why Clinton should not be removed from office.Even though Clinton broke his oath ""to see to it that the laws be faithfully executed,"" Byrd said, and by doing so had ""undermined the system of justice and law on which this Republic … has its foundation,"" and even though it was reasonable to view these as impeachable offenses, Senators should vote to acquit Clinton. Why? because of ""the people's perception that this entire matter is being driven by political agendas.""Byrd said that removing Clinton under these circumstances would ""only serve to further undermine a public trust that is too much damaged already."" Byrd, he said, correctly understood that just because a president can be impeached, doesn't mean he should be impeached.Tribe says elsewhere in his book that in the case of Clinton, ""impeachment was misused by partisans opposed to the president but unable to identify a great offense against the nation.""Has it not occurred to Tribe — or anyone else who's been baying for Trump's removal for the past 17 months — that he is doing exactly the same thing today?All the talk of impeaching Trump has been nakedly partisan, driven not by any ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but by personal or political animus.And since impeachment advocates haven't been able to find any ""great offense"" to the nation committed by Trump — other than his offending liberals — they've simply tossed anything and everything they can onto the impeachment pile.Yet 56% of those following the Mueller investigation closely say that talk of impeaching Trump is premature, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll. Among independents, it's 58%; among Republicans, 88%.Meanwhile, despite overwhelmingly negative coverage, Trump's approval ratings have been climbing. The public is more optimistic about the future. And the latest Gallup poll shows that satisfaction with the direction of the country is higher than it's been since 2005, and equal to the poll's 40-year average.If Trump were impeached, there's little doubt that it would be seen by a significant portion of the country as a blatant attempt by Democrats to nullify an election on the flimsiest of terms.Talk about undermining public trust.We don't doubt Tribe's mastery of constitutional law. But by letting politics drive his impeachment views, Tribe makes himself look less like a legal scholar who deserves respect and more like a partisan hack who deserves none.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump's Wins Turn Democrats' World Upside DownTrump Keeps Big Promise To Israel — Next Up, Peace In Mideast?Democrats Want To Impeach A Republican President?

Over the years, Congress has conceded the tariff powers to the president.It isn't clear how likely passage of Lee's legislation is.

59,MAR,"The stock market is one of the most important factors for a swing trade's success. Getting the direction right is critical, but not always easy. Analyzing market behavior day by day is preferable to guessing, but some measure of expectation going into a trade helps proper positioning. This is where historical precedents play a part. A little compare and contrast analysis starts building a model of what the future may hold. But if reality deviates from your model, reality always wins.Last week's column mentioned a few times similar to the current market. One of them was the sell-off in early 2016, the most recent correction with some time and depth.X After getting support at its 50- and 200-day moving averages (1), the Nasdaq composite went above those lines for a short time before slicing through them again. First, it dropped below the 50-day moving average on a 1% loss (2). Things worsened the next day on more than a 2% gap down below the 200-day line (3). This vertical violation of the moving averages was similar to the Nasdaq action at the beginning of February this year.When suffering days of losses, you eventually have a bounce at some point. It's important to not plow back into the market too quickly as one day of buying could just be temporary. That was the case twice in 2016 as two reversal attempts rapidly failed (4).The follow-through day is a more proven sign of a turn, but even those don't always work. Especially with a vertical violation and correction, the first one or two tries have higher failure rates. In 2016, a follow-through day on Jan. 26 (5) saw the Nasdaq composite up 1.1%, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials each came in above 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 more than 2%. Despite the breadth of strength, two weeks later markets hit new lows.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Just because one signal doesn't work, doesn't mean to ignore the next. On Feb. 17 another follow-through day triggered (6) starting a strong uptrend that held above its 50-day moving average throughout most of the next two years.The correction, with a little more time, produced a flurry of new growth prospects including Nvidia (NVDA) that joined IBD's SwingTrader on Mar. 11 (7) on its way to a phenomenal move.How does this inform the current market? The action last week put a dent in the follow-through day we saw on Feb. 14. However, supporting action on Friday improved the outlook, keeping the Nasdaq composite above its 50-day moving average line and the rally intact. More importantly, it gave individual stocks more time to form sound patterns. It's early to say whether this reversal holds but the extra time does put it more in line with past precedents.More details on current market analysis are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:What A Week Of Bearish Reversals Means For Swing TradesThis Adage Rings True For Sideways MarketsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

63,MAR,"The Phillips curve theory at the heart of the Federal Reserve's approach to raising interest rates as the economic expansion marches ahead is that lower unemployment gives rise to faster wage growth.X Fed policymakers figure that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Yet those assumptions central to proactive monetary policy — the steady diet of Fed rate hikes even when inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target — have taken some knocks lately.With the jobless rate expected to sink below 4% this year and fall to 3.5% or lower in 2019, one of the biggest questions for financial markets is how much the link between unemployment, wages and inflation will finally assert itself?Soon after tax reform passed in December, dozens of major companies — including Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Bank of America (BAC) and Starbucks (SBUX) — announced wage hikes, a reflection of a tightening labor market. It's a good bet that wage growth is heading higher, but how much pricing power will companies really have?Here are five keys to understanding the outlook for inflation and Fed rate-hike policy:To understand why the link between wages and inflation isn't as clear as it once was, Target (TGT) is a good place to start. In September 2017, the discount retailer announced a big wage hike and broad-based price cuts just three weeks apart.The price cuts on thousands of items came shortly after Amazon.com (AMZN) celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on select items like avocados and kale.Then, in a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market, Target hiked its minimum wage from $10 to $11 an hour and committed to a $15 hourly wage by the end of 2020.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near term when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even when its profits disappointed.Internet-enabled transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson has explained that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. With just a few relatively modest trend reversals, inflation has been moving in only one direction since 1980: lower.After sinking from more than 10% in 1980, core consumer price inflation, which excludes the sometimes-volatile food and energy categories, hasn't touched 3% since 1995. Aggressive Fed rate hikes under Paul Volcker pushed back inflation in the early 1980s, while pre-emptive Fed rate increases in the mid-1990s under Alan Greenspan ushered in the current low-inflation environment.Amid technological advances that empower the consumer and the globalization of manufacturing supply chains, in part to capitalize on lower-wage labor, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index hasn't even touched 2.5% in decades and sat at 1.5% at the end of 2017.Even if tight labor markets and near-3% GDP growth foster a bit more inflation, perspective is in order: Neither investors nor Fed policymakers are likely to get overly concerned.You might guess that the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which raised eyebrows with its near-$1,000 starting price when it was released in November 2017, sent the price index for phone equipment surging after its release, and you'd be right — to a point. The Labor Department, which adjusts price changes to account for technological advances, said that phone equipment costs fell 2.6% in January 2018 vs. a year earlier, which was the smallest decline since 2011.The combination of quality improvements, productivity gains in manufacturing and global competition goes a long way to explaining why most inflation is in services. In the year through January, services inflation was running at 2.6%, while goods inflation was just 1.2%. Excluding food and energy, goods inflation was -0.7%.An exception in the goods category is prescription drugs, whose prices always rise, bringing political scrutiny. But prescription-drug prices rose just 2.4% in January vs. a year earlier, roughly half the increase seen in the prior three years. Prescription benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said average per-member prescription costs of the employer plans it serves rose 1.5%, the lowest since 1993. One key: Generic fill rates rose 86% over the prior year. That likely reflects, in part, the FDA's new expedited generics approval approach, so the gains may be sustained.Likewise, health care services prices rose a historically tame 2% in January. In regulated industries like health care, where prices are rarely transparent and government plays an especially large role, the power to raise prices is limited by the regulator.The Fed's favored PCE price index, unlike the CPI, reflects prices that individuals pay, both directly and indirectly, such as for health care that is subsidized by government and employers. Health care accounts for just over 20% of the PCE index vs. about 9% of the CPI's weight. Meanwhile, housing accounts for a similar 20% of the PCE index, but more than 30% of the CPI. With shelter costs rising 3.2% from a year ago in January, that difference goes a long way to explaining why core CPI inflation typically exceeds core PCE inflation.As labor markets tighten and workers have more opportunity to quit and find greener pastures, companies pressured to raise wages have three possibilities for dealing with their higher compensation costs: increase prices, accept lower profits or offset the higher wage bill by increasing worker output or finding other efficiencies.To some extent, the earnings boost from the Trump tax cuts, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21%, could make companies more willing to swallow higher wages without passing those costs on to customers. Incentives in the tax bill allowing for immediate expensing of equipment purchases could increase investment to make workers more productive.A key question will be whether heightened wage pressures and bigger investment incentives can combine to get the U.S. out of the productivity rut it's been in for much of the past decade. If so, that could raise the growth ceiling on the economy without stoking inflation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWhy A Bull Market Rally Is The Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

149,MAR,"President Donald Trump lashed out at Amazon.com (AMZN) and the U.S. Postal Service in a tweet Friday, saying the e-commerce leader should pay higher fees for package deliveries.X Amazon has previously been accused of underpaying the Postal Service for deliveries, a charge leveled in July by Josh Sandbulte of Greenhaven Associates in a Wall Street Journal article.Amazon at the time denied the claim, saying its partnership with USPS is reviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission, which ""has consistently found that Amazon's contracts with the USPS are profitable.""Trump's tweet sent Amazon shares down, while FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) rose.""Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!"" Trump tweeted Friday morning.Amazon uses the U.S. Postal Service for completing last-mile deliveries, with postal carriers dropping off packages at about 150 million residences and businesses daily.Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, have been frequent targets of Trump over taxes and jobs. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which has written many stories critical of the Trump administration.In August, Trump attacked Amazon over taxes and accused it of causing job losses during a time when Amazon was aggressively hiring, as were businesses across the nation.""Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!,"" Trump said in his Twitter postIn June, Trump attacked Amazon in a tweet, accusing it of ""not paying internet taxes.""

Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!"" said the Trump tweet.Amazon shares fell 1.4% to 1,169.47 on the stock market today. FedEx was up 0.5% to 249.54.

162,MAR,"The U.S. economy is about to get an injection of rocket fuel.Many economists have argued that ""this is as good as it gets"" for U.S. economic growth. But President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear and give a further boost to the long, strong stock market rally.X Now in the ninth year of an underwhelming recovery, the economy was long held back by an overhang of debt and speed bumps from China to the oil patch. It's finally hit its stride and seems set to step up its pace in 2018.""We've got a global synchronized boom with low inflation,"" said strategist Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He called it an ideal ""Goldilocks scenario"" for investors, with the economy neither too hot or too cold.If it continues until June 2019, the U.S. economic expansion will break the record 120-month run of the 1991-2001 expansion.With the jobless rate at a 17-year-low 4.1%, seemingly the only worry on the horizon is that a Trump tax fiscal boost now may be too much of a good thing, leading the economy to overheat and the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes.But inflation remains in hiding. Part of the credit goes to Amazon.com (AMZN) for injecting intense price competition into one industry after another. Evermore powerful tech titans like Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google don't need massive investment, or payrolls, to generate enormous profits. Aging demographics, meantime, acts as a restraint on excessive growth.There's even reason to think that the extra firepower from the Trump tax cuts, will reinforce the U.S. economy's strength, rather than jeopardize its growth streak.Global central banks are pulling back on massive monetary stimulus while China aims to wean itself off another burst of debt-induced growth. U.S. business investment and productivity growth have been lackluster. Tax reforms like lower corporate levies would help counter these economic headwinds.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should pay attention to big economic and news events, but don't let them distract you from how markets are behaving. Read The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the major market averages and leading stocks, letting you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Republican tax plans being merged by the House and Senate would, in addition to cutting the corporate tax rate to 20%, let businesses immediately deduct the cost of new investments. The bills would set rules aiming to create a more level playing field for U.S. multinationals. For individuals, tax reform would lower rates, nearly doubling the standard deduction and hiking the child tax credit. That would be offset, especially for high-tax blue states, by fewer deductions.A year ago, Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen seemed to throw cold water on the tax reform plans being hatched by President-elect Trump and the Republican Congress. ""Fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment,"" she said.Now, with the unemployment rate a half-point lower thanks to 2 million new jobs, the Fed will likely weigh in on Wednesday (Dec. 13) to determine what the tax cuts will mean for monetary policy. Policymakers telegraphed three 2018 increases in its key overnight lending rate in their September projections, and it's possible that they will update their projections to hint at four hikes next year.New York Fed President William Dudley, who is stepping down soon, said Dec. 1 that it's ""probably not the best time"" for more fiscal stimulus.Yet Wall Street doesn't seem concerned. Markets still are pricing in just two quarter-point rate increases in 2018, following a near-certain hike on Wednesday.The risk of an overaggressive Fed — the usual suspect in curtailing an economic expansion — can't be dismissed. But policymakers have traveled a fair distance this year in accepting that the Phillips curve — the link between lower unemployment and higher inflation — may no longer be as predictive as they once thought.Policymakers have long argued that inflation would rise as unemployment fell below 4.5%, but the opposite happened this year, even as growth picked up. The core personal consumption expenditures deflator, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, registered just 1.4% in October, down from 1.8% in February. It hasn't hit the central bank's 2% target in five years.Minutes of the Fed's November meeting revealed that most members of the Fed's policymaking committee saw a meaningful chance that low inflation will have staying power: ""Many participants observed, however, that continued low readings on inflation, which had occurred even as the labor market tightened, might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.""In a way, the Trump tax cuts are a bet that low inflation will endure. While no sure thing, Republicans are putting their chips on some powerful trends.This month's megamerger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) is a case in point. Spurred by the threat of Amazon joining the prescription drug business, CVS plans to remake drugstores into low-cost medical-service shops.CVS's plan is in line with the push to move health care to the most cost-efficient setting. Health care inflation, which historically outpaced overall inflation, has become a moderating force. Growing government budget pressures suggest that will persist.Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained in August why the hotel group has more trouble raising prices than it did in past cycles. While home-sharing via disrupters such as Airbnb has some impact, the bigger issue is ""radical transparency in pricing"" thanks to the internet.""With each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel,"" he said.Joachim Fels, managing director of Pimco, cites the rise of superstar tech firms as a key reason why ""super-low natural interest rates are likely here to stay.""Titans led by Facebook, Apple and Google ""make higher profits, save more than they invest and pay out a smaller share of their value-added to labor,"" he wrote in August. Their growing dominance helps explain the seemingly broken link between unemployment and wages.The retirement of baby boomers also is curbing wage growth. Higher-paid workers are exiting in large numbers, replaced by lower-paid, younger hires. Aging demographics go a long way toward explaining the persistence of low interest rates, Fed researchers contend.If Goldilocks sticks around, even as tax cuts juice the economy and corporate profits, the current bull market in stocks may continue to surprise to the upside.Solid earnings gains, fueled by the best global economic growth since 2010, could be supersized by a 20% corporate tax rate. The combination of earnings with ""the perception that this expansion has a lot longer to go"" could lift the S&P 500 to 3150 by the end of 2018, a 20% rise, Yardeni says. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at about 2637  now.His outlook envisions investors bidding stocks to a ""meltup multiple"" of 20 times earnings. S&P 500 earnings should grow 7.2% to $141 a share, from $131.50, he says. That includes $6 per share via the tax cut (assuming the 20% corporate rate kicks in immediately, as in the House bill, instead of delayed to 2019 in the Senate version).Economists at Goldman Sachs and UBS are among those who expect the Fed to signal four rate hikes in 2018, but even that is unlikely to derail their bull market thesis.UBS thinks tax cuts could push the S&P 500 as high as 3300 next year. Its analysts assume the Fed will be done raising rates for this cycle after four hikes in 2018. UBS sees the PCE deflator's annual gain of just 1.75% by the end of next year. That's comfortably below the Fed's 2% target.Goldman equity strategist David Kostin's ""rational exuberance"" outlook comes with a 2018 S&P 500 target of 2850, assuming the 10-year Treasury yield rises to 3%. Stocks could rise further if yields and inflation undershoot, and Kostin doesn't rule out a touch of 1990s-style ""irrational exuberance.""Goldman's alternative scenario has the S&P falling to 2450 in 2018, about 7% below current levels, if expectations for corporate tax cuts came to naught.An economy with a head of steam can surely withstand a moderate stock market downturn. But this long-in-the-tooth economic expansion might look more fragile if Republicans weren't on the verge of a major legislative victory.However, that's not the consensus view. Many, if not most economists, have concerns about the Trump tax cuts. Moody's Analytics calls the GOP tax bill a ""fiscal mistake"" that will likely push the economy into a ""boom-bust cycle"" and cut short the late-stage expansion.Yet Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, told IBD that this is a good time for fiscal stimulus. ECRI's forward-looking indicators point to ""a slowdown that most don't see coming."" Those include rising junk bond yields and softer industrial commodity prices, he says.Already the U.S. has been through three decelerations and reaccelerations during this expansion, Achuthan says. He thinks it's on the cusp of a fourth one, possibly mild.Yet a timely fiscal boost from tax cuts, which could begin to show up in individual paychecks via lower withholding starting in January, ""can bolster confidence, if it's viewed positively,"" Achuthan said.The roots of the most recent global reacceleration started in China in early 2016 when Beijing unleashed $1 trillion in credit, helping to restore calm to world financial markets, alongside the actions of various central banks.Now China's growth is gradually cooling as the government seeks to curb unsustainable credit growth. Meanwhile, the Fed has begun slowly reversing its financial-crisis-driven asset purchases. The eurozone economy has finally gained a little momentum, but the European Central Bank will soon start scaling back its bond buying.These clouds in the economic outlook look a lot less worrisome with an injection of tax stimulus set to hit the world's largest economy.Just how much of a boost the GOP tax cuts will deliver is unclear. Wall Street firms generally have modest expectations. Goldman Sachs predicts 2.6% GDP growth in the U.S. and 4% growth worldwide.Goldman economists expect a 0.3-percentage-point boost to U.S. growth in 2018 and again in 2019 on the assumption that the bulk of the tax cut tilted to corporations and higher earners will be saved, not spent. Even a modest Trump tax-cut boost could have a significant impact on labor markets, boosting wage gains and drawing more people into the workforce.Doubts about the tax reform impact reflect the plan's government debt increase, which could push up bond yields. Economists also are unsure how businesses will respond to lower tax rates.At least until recently, business investment has been among the weaker aspects of the expansion despite healthy corporate profits.Herein lies the real test for the Trump economic revolution's investment focus, says George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen.The ""near-obsessive drive"" to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% ""will very likely attract a significant amount of foreign investment,"" he wrote.After a long investment drought, he thinks that ""supercharging investment might help build clusters of excellence, boosting innovation, wages and eventually tax revenue.""RELATED:Why Innovation Isn't Fueling Growth In Economy, WagesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

163,MAR,"Federal Reserve policymakers convinced that low unemployment will feed through to higher wage gains will take comfort from Monday's big announcement that Target (TGT) will hike its minimum wage from $10 an hour to $11 next month, reaching $15 by 2020.Target seems to be proving the Fed hawks right: The retailer's move is, first and foremost, a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market. It follows last month's Amazon.com (AMZN) jobs day, recruiting 50,000 people to work for $12 an hour or more, which attracted huge crowds of people.By telegraphing wage hikes for the next few years, Target is making a long-term bet that by becoming an employer of choice, it will make both employees and customers happy and allow it to thrive — not just survive — amid a battle for domination between Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon.Target's impact on the labor market is significant, with its 330,000 employees, though it doesn't approach that of Wal-Mart, whose base wage hike to $10 an hour last spring led Target, Costco (COST) and a host of other retailers to respond with wage hikes. ""I think it will be a game where other retailers are going to have to match,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Minnesota Public Radio.

The answer: Probably not any time soon. Just ask Target, which announced three weeks ago that it was cutting prices on thousands of items. That came shortly after Amazon celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on items like avocados and kale.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near-term especially when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even as profits have disappointed.Internet-enabled price transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained last month that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers and business travel is pretty good, not great, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""""It's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disrupters in the space,"" Sorenson said on an earnings call. ""It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel.""Yarbrough notes that Wal-Mart saw better employee retention and higher sales after its wage hikes, but the higher sales weren't enough to offset the extra costs. While Wal-Mart obviously has the financial strength to hike wages, the question is whether retail-sector laggards will be able to follow suit. If not, will the inability to hang onto quality workers hasten their demise?At some point, the strong retailers that emerge from this hypercompetitive period may be able to raise prices, but who knows when?Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, in a Tuesday afternoon speech, conceded that structural shifts may be affecting price rises, but still says that recent low inflation is ""probably temporary."" But she stressed that it would be imprudent to wait until inflation hits 2% before tightening.RELATED:Target Lifts Minimum Wage To $11 Per Hour, Aims For $15 By 2020The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltHere's What Is Eating At Inflation — And The Fed's ConsensusStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

164,MAR,"Your stocks to watch this week are five hotels and casinos that are trading in buy range: Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), Hyatt Hotels (H), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Resorts (MLCO). But just because they are in buy zones, doesn't mean you shouldn't keep an eye on other key factors, like volume, as well as the major averages and leading stocks.Hilton Worldwide on Friday cleared a 67.89 buy point from a three-month long cup base. Though Hilton gained 1.3% to 68.19, volume on the breakout was below average.Marriott International is flirting with a 107.73 buy point from a double-bottom base. Heavy volume on Wednesday, when Marriott first cleared the entry, has been followed by light turnover. Marriott rose 0.3% to 107.88 on Friday, back above the entry, but in light trade.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for more actionable stocks? Make sure to check out MarketSmith's screener tools. You can filter recent breakouts, stocks hitting new highs, tight trading action and more. Take a risk-free trial of MarketSmith.Hyatt Hotels has been on a steady climb since coming off the Aug. 18 bottom of its cup base, and shares are now trading within the buy zone from a 61.17 entry, closing the week at 61.29. Ready to yawn? Volume has been well below average for Hyatt, too.Among casinos, Wynn Resorts remains in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 139.77 buy point on Sept. 1. Wynn has been trading more or less sideways at the top of the buy zone since, and volume has dried up. Wynn fell 0.3% to 144.91 on Friday.Melco Resorts broke out of a base last Tuesday, edged above the 5% buy zone intraday Wednesday and is now trading just above the 23.35 buy point, finishing the week at 23.53. Melco's volume was above average for the initial breakout, but the action has cooled.We've been seeing stalling action for many breakouts as of late, with the Nasdaq moving more or less sideways for the month of September. Ideally, you want to see strong volume on a breakout with the stock extending its gains, rather than sluggish, low-volume action within the buy zone.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksS&P 500, Nasdaq Are Trading At Highs, But Big Winners LackingLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

167,MAR,"The recent share price action is nothing to write home about, but the fundamentals are striking for real estate investment trust Hersha Hospitality (HT) .The Philadelphia-based REIT owns 53 upscale and mid-scale hotels with 8,508 rooms in big cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Miami, Los Angeles and others. Its hotel brands include Hilton (HLT), Marriott (MAR), Hyatt (H), and Starwood's (HOT) Sheraton, and they are geared toward corporate and leisure travelers.The stock attempted to carve out a saucer base, but failed during the summer and remains in a downtrend. The Relative Strength rating is in the low 30s, and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a worst possible E, showing that the big investors are sellers.But funds from operation, the REIT equivalent of earnings, along with revenue, have been growing. In the most recent quarter, FFO rose 24% from a year earlier, and revenue rose 10%, with analysts forecasting 15% growth in 2016.Dividend growth has also impressed. After several years of quarterly dividends of 6 cents a share, Hersha raised the payout to 7 cents in 2014, then to 28 cents earlier this year, equal to a 5% annualized dividend yield.Wells Fargo analysts said in November the company is in talks to sell some of its New York and suburban properties. Any proceeds would be used to buy back shares or purchase more hotels.On Dec. 1, Janney Montgomery Scott analysts started coverage at neutral. They said the company is well-run, but they worry about industry factors and the fact the company is highly focused with 71% of earnings coming from New York, Miami and California. There's a danger, they said, of rising supply, poor performance, lagging international travel, loss of pricing power and the proliferation of Airbnb.

236,MAR,"The consumer price index rose 0.5% in September and 2.2% vs. a year earlier, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.1% on the month and 1.7% from a year ago.Wall Street expected the headline CPI to rise 0.6% on the month and 2.3% from a year ago, thanks to a hurricane-inflicted boost in energy prices. The core CPI was expected to rise 0.2% and 1.8% from a year ago. Hurricane effects also raised the risk of an uptick in core inflation, as the owners of damaged homes and destroyed vehicles began repairs and shopped for replacements, but new and used vehicle prices fell.After the report, the 10-year Treasury yield moved lower. The CPI data likely doesn't change the near-term outlook for Federal Reserve policy, with markets expecting a December rate hike, but it could lower the odds that the Fed will stick to its plan of three rate hikes in 2018.Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials held onto gains on the stock market today after the inflation report. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other financials lost ground as the data dampened prospects for wider net interest margins that can come from higher long-term interest rates. BofA reported better-than-expected earnings early Friday, while Wells Fargo missed on revenue.Prices for food consumed at home didn't budge in September after a 0.2% drop in August that may have partly reflected price cuts at Whole Foods after Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its acquisition. Target (TGT) announced price cuts in early September. Prices for food consumed away from home rose 0.4%.Prices for telephone hardware and related consumer information gear fell 1.2%, showing no obvious shift from its steady downward trend after Apple (AAPL) released its pricey iPhone 8.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of major banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America are in buy range, less than 5% above buy points cleared in recent weeks. A buy point is the point when an investor has the best chance of near-term gains. If firmer inflation readings send long-term interest rates higher, the stocks are likely to continue their ascent. To find other stocks poised for gains, start with these IBD lists.The Fed has given mixed signals about the inflation outlook and what it means for policy. Despite members' hawkish rate projections, minutes from the Sept. 19-20 meeting reflected an extensive discussion of factors that will likely keep a lid on inflation going forward, including the impact of technological innovation on business pricing.Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained on an earnings call last month that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers and business travel is pretty good, not great, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""""It's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disrupters in the space,"" Sorenson said. ""It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel.""Fed members also suggested that government health care policies might continue to hold down medical care inflation, which hit a new 50-year low annual rate of 1.6% in September. Prescription drug prices fell 0.6% on the month.CVS Health (CVS) said in August that it saw flat same-store prescription volumes in the second quarter, but pharmacy same-store sales fell 2.8%, dragged down by recent generic introductions. While drug pricing moderation from generic competition often comes in waves, this wave is likely to be more sustained amid the FDA's new plan to expedite review of generic drug applications.""We're already seeing results, as May and June of this year have seen the most generic drug approvals since the FDA began tallying its monthly approvals,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on an August 8 conference call.RELATED:GM, Ford Soar As U.S. Auto Sales Get Post-Hurricane Surge 5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumBank of America Tops Q3 Earnings ViewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The Fed is seen beginning to curb its massive balance sheet at next week's policy meeting.Food at home prices fell 0.2% on the month, which saw Amazon.com (AMZN) complete its Whole Foods Markets acquisition and immediately cut prices on items like kale and avocados by up to 43%.

That's a sharp contrast with Federal Reserve policymakers' expectation of four hikes by the end of 2018.But doubts have crept in among more Fed committee members as the central bank's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index has shown an easing in inflation pressure, with the headline rate sliding from 2.2% in February to 1.4% in June, and core inflation easing to 1.4% from 1.9%.Part of the moderation reflects a leveling off of energy prices after a moderate rebound in 2016.

The pending acquisition of Whole Foods Markets (WFM) by Amazon, which currently holds a tiny sliver of industry sales, means that no let-up on the pricing war is in sight.Used-car prices could fall 6% this year and another 3% to 5% in 2018, LMC Automotive forecasts, as a wave of vehicles come off lease, saturating the market. The longer-term outlook also points to lower prices. Morgan Stanley says prices could fall by 20% to 50% over the next four years as a technology shift to electric and self-driving cars from Tesla (TSLA) and others sinks the trade-in value for today's models.RELATED:Amazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsTeva Pharma Crashes To 13-Year Low On 'Very Tough Quarter'

243,MAR,"Bill Marriott is still very active at 85, as the executive chairman and chairman of the board of Marriott International (MAR), the world's largest hotel company. He stepped down as CEO in 2012, after four decades in that position.""I've visited 70 hotels so far in 2017 and I'll get to more than 100 by the end of the year,"" Marriott told IBD from his vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee, N.H., near those of his children and their kids. That's his relaxed schedule: As CEO, twice that would receive his perfectionist inspections. He's been all over the world, yet he says, ""I love every minute of it right here on the lake.""Travel is important because it ""provides an understanding of how other people live,"" he added. ""My wife and I went with my parents to China in 1979 and there were Mao suits and bicycles everywhere, with everything under tight control. We've watched China emerge to become the second largest economy in the world and it's now a major focus of our expansion and marketing.""People come to America from all over the world with questions and they almost always go away with a better feeling about our country and the great opportunities it provides.""He was born John Willard Marriott Jr. in 1932 in Washington, D.C., where his father and mother, Alice, had opened an A&W Root Beer franchise five years before. They soon added food service and renamed it The Hot Shoppe, where Bill did every kind of job during high school.Marriott graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in finance in 1954. The next year, he married Donna Garff and served as a supply officer on an aircraft carrier to fulfill his ROTC commitment.When he returned in 1956, The Hot Shoppes were expanding and the family was about to open its first hotel in Arlington, Va. It had an ideal location near the airport, but no one understood how to run it, so Bill volunteered. They opened another nearby in 1959, when company sales reached $46 million, and Bill kept pushing to add hotels, while his father resisted taking on more debt.""We were just smart enough to know we had something fresh to offer and just naive enough to go at it with the wide-eyed enthusiasm and energy of a bunch of kids who knew nothing about the business,"" he wrote in his memoir, ""Without Reservations: How a Family Root Beer Stand Grew Into a Global Hotel Company.""Bill was named president in 1964, when sales hit $84 million and they had 9,600 employees and four hotels. Five years later, the publicly held and renamed Marriott Corp. had 11 hotels — including the first foreign one in Acapulco, Mexico — with sales totaling $257 million. It began franchising in 1970 and Bill was made CEO two years later.Over the next decade, the company diversified into cruise ships, theme parks and travel agencies, with $1.5 billion in sales in 1979. Given the size and scope the company had reached, he then put in place a strategic planning unit that helped them focus on hotels and improved the management of change.In 1983, the company had grown to include 131 hotels in 79 cities, before opening the first two Courtyard by Marriott hotels, which Marriott says he considers one of the most important innovations he's overseen. (Forbes magazine ranks the company No. 1 for innovation in the industry.)""We were the first big chain to go down-market, with a moderate-priced offering with nice rooms — with no frills and fewer staff. And everybody told us we were crazy,"" he said. ""Today, we have over 1,000 Courtyard hotels.""Two years later, his father died and Bill was elected chairman of the board.""He took his father's legacy and led it into a modern era by focusing on innovations that the industry has tried to copy, defining the direction of the business and the guest experience of hospitality,"" said Arne Sorenson, president and CEO at the Bethesda, Md., headquarters, where two of Marriott's children are executives (another left to invest in startups).In 1987, the company acquired the Residence Inn chain and opened its first Fairfield Inn, an economy-priced, limited-service line. Two years later, the company went through major restructuring, as debt reached $3.3 billion, selling off its airline-catering and restaurant divisions.In 1993, he implemented the most important innovation of his career, splitting the company into Marriott International, which he would run as an asset-light management firm, and Host Marriott, run by his brother, Richard, which would own real estate and operate concessions. (The concessions business was acquired by Italy-based Autogrill in 1999.)""We didn't invent the management contract, but we created the company that was able to exit from real estate ownership, while our competitors stayed in it,"" he said. ""We expect to use the cash from selling the final couple of dozen properties obtained from the Starwood acquisition over the next few years, to grow the business and enhance shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases.""Marriott's operating margins are around an enviable 50%. For managed hotels, the company is reimbursed for all staffing costs and provides marketing, reservations, and the loyalty platform (Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest) at cost, in return for management fees on total revenues. Franchisees generally pay a royalty on room revenue only, a marketing fee, and the cost for reservations and the loyalty program. (They either operate the hotels themselves or contract that to others).""We were the first hotel to develop a frequent-guest stay program in 1984, and everyone said we were crazy — again,"" said Marriott. ""The president of Hyatt said, 'I'll bury you in advertising.' Today, our loyalty programs have 100 million members and we are adding 1 million a month.""One of the keys to Bill Marriott's success has been to follow his father's advice: ""Take care of the associate and the associate will take care of the guest, so the guest will return again and again."" There is a generous benefit program and no limit to advancement, so high retention results in more highly skilled personnel who provide better service (with 675,000 currently wearing the Marriott name tag). Half the general managers came from the hourly ranks, says Marriott, and on average they've been  managers for 25 years. (According to Hilton Hotels (HLT), its managers average 15 years in that role). Part of the company's hiring philosophy has been to screen for those with a friendly personality and dependability, since technical skills can be trained. (Marriott International regularly makes Fortune's list of ""100 Best Companies to Work For."")""Mr. Marriott is more than my boss,"" said Sorenson. ""He's a mentor and a friend.""Last year, the company acquired Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide for $13.6 billion, bringing total properties today to over 6,100 in 124 countries and territories. To Marriott's other top brands, including Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance, Starwood added such high-end names as W Hotels, Westin, Sheraton, Le Meridien, and St. Regis. Marriott International now has 1.2 million rooms, with 430,000 in the development pipeline, and last year reported revenues of $17.1 billion and net income of $780 million (including Starwood numbers from Sept. 23, 2016).Since the 1993 split that created Marriott International, the adjusted stock price has risen from $5 to a recent $100, a 1,900% increase, and it regularly makes Fortune's Most Admired Companies list.Making sure that there are opportunities for workers at the bottom to rise to the top.Overcame: Disasters that challenged the company's ability to retain customers and employees, including 9/11 and the Great Recession.Lesson: Anticipate your customers' needs.""The four most important words in the English language are: 'What do you think?'

244,MAR,"Alibaba (BABA) users can now use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book hotel rooms at Marriott International (MAR), thanks to a joint venture that aims to draw in more of China's middle class.Marriott, which reported better-than-expected earnings but weak guidance after the market close, moved closer to a buy point on Monday, while Alibaba continued to soar.XChinese travelers are projected to take about 700 million trips over the next five years, according to a joint statement from Alibaba and Marriott, the latter of which sees itself benefiting from greater Chinese travel market share and lower distribution costs.""By forming this partnership, we are pairing our hospitality expertise with Alibaba's digital travel platform, retail expertise and digital payment platform, Alipay, and driving membership to our loyalty programs. With the growing number of Chinese consumers exploring new destinations, this venture will introduce our hotels worldwide to this new and growing traveling class,"" said Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson in the release.Travelers can participate in ""customized experiences"" through both Alibaba and Marriott's loyalty programs, and can use Alipay to pay for their Marriott stay in certain global markets.Marriott isn't the only American brand looking to grow its appeal in China through Alibaba. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) late last month launched its flagship and kids brands on Alibaba's T-mall platform.Marriott shares rose as high as 107.63 soon after the open, cooling for a 1.1% gain at 106.17 in the stock market today. The stock is building a flat base with 110.61 buy point. Alibaba shares climbed 3.6% to 158.84.IBD'S TAKE: Should you pick up shares of Marriott or Alibaba ahead of their earnings reports? Here are key tips on when to buy stocks. Meanwhile, Marriott reported better-than-expected results for the June quarter. EPS climbed to $1.13 a share while revenue swelled to $5.80 billion. Analysts had expected EPS to dip 1% to $1.02, while revenue grew 31% to $5.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue per available room (RevPAR) grew 2.2% worldwide and 0.9% in North America.But Marriott sees current-quarter EPS of 96-99 cents vs. analyst views for $1.02. Marriott shares fell more than 2% in late trading.Marriott has a 97 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 97% of all other stocks based on a variety of key IBD ratings.

247,MAR,"The future of U.S. homebuilding depends on more people like Cyndicy Yarborough, a 26-year-old former Wal-Mart (WMT) clerk with no background in construction.At Blueprint Robotics in Baltimore, she works in a factory that builds houses like cars, on an assembly line, using robots that fire thousands of nails into studs each day and never miss. Yarborough operates a machine that lifts floors and walls and packs them onto a flatbed truck, the final step before delivery to a development site where they'll be pieced together.""I like being a part of something new, on the cutting edge,"" said Yarborough, a single mother who took the job at Blueprint last May.For all the concern over automation removing jobs from the workforce, companies like Blueprint are actually helping to ease a labor shortage that has crimped construction of residences and commercial properties across the country. The plants enable developers to fill the gap by having houses and apartment buildings manufactured off-site, for less money and in a fraction of the time. Even Marriott International (MAR), the world's biggest hotel operator, is increasingly turning to modular construction for some of its properties.To meet growing demand, high-tech plants are opening, and older factories that were shuttered after the last decade's real estate crash — many in areas such as rural Pennsylvania, where labor costs are cheap — are being revived. Builders hire the factories to manufacture homes in sections, which are transported on trucks, then laid down on foundations by cranes, like giant Legos. Sometimes the modules are fully framed rooms, complete with tile showers and gourmet kitchens.""This has to be the wave of the future — I don't know how we solve the labor shortage otherwise,"" said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif.-based homebuilding consultant. ""What drives modular construction is the ability to build the house more cost-effectively.""U.S. homebuilders say the labor crunch is their biggest challenge, and that it's pushing costs up as much as 5.2% on average over 12 months, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo surveys last year. President Trump's proposals to crack down on undocumented workers may further squeeze the industry, which is heavily dependent on immigrant labor.Confidence among U.S. homebuilders cooled in April after jumping a month earlier to the highest level since mid-2005, according to data released April 17 by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo.The idea of transporting homes in prefabricated sections has roots in the early 1900s, when homesteaders could buy kits from a Sears Roebuck catalog for assembly on their newly acquired plots of land. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly popular to build lower-cost homes in factories, according to Gary Fleisher, who runs a blog for the industry called Modularhomecoach.com.Today's plants are capable of producing bigger buildings with more elaborate designs. The Blueprint factory in Baltimore is one of the first in the U.S. to use robots, Fleisher said. Taller multifamily buildings, dorms and hotels are increasingly being manufactured indoors. And so are mansions that sell for millions.""Some builders won't even advertise they work with modular companies like us,"" said Myles Biggs, general manager of Ritz-Craft's Pennsylvania construction facility. ""You could be driving past a modular home and not even know it, because it looks just like one next door.""Ritz-Craft can deliver a single-family house in six to eight weeks, on average. Having an indoor facility means weather delays are rarely a factor. Each worker is given a narrow concentration, like tiling floors or sanding drywall, which increases production speed. People without any background in construction can become skilled laborers in two weeks, according to Biggs.The idea is catching on with Marriott, which aims to have agreements with North American developers this year to produce about 50 of its Select branded hotels in factories, said Karim Khalifa, senior vice president of global design strategies. In December, Marriott opened a Fairfield Inn in Folsom, Calif., with 97 rooms — all built at a Guerdon Enterprises plant in Boise, Idaho.Last month, a collection of Marriott hotel rooms was getting wood-framed walls and ceilings at a Champion Homes factory in Liverpool, Pa. Even the beds and televisions will be in place before the boxes are shipped through stretches of highway and stacked in Chapel Hill, N.C., next month.""What we like is how well modular is built,"" Khalifa said. ""These things have all been designed to be transported. They have the integrity of a shipping container.""Apartment developers, too, are increasingly going with modular construction, especially in fast-growing cities such as Denver and Nashville, Tenn., said Rich Rozycki, head of Champion Homes' commercial division, which has seen its pipeline grow 50% since 2014. The company also has had discussions with national homebuilders looking for a solution to their labor problems, he said.Labor costs are more favorable for factory construction, according to David Reed, vice president of Champion's modular division. Workers make about $15 to $20 an hour in rural Pennsylvania. That compares with $50 to $100 an hour in the markets the manufacturers serve, like New York's Hudson Valley and the Washington, D.C., area, Reed said.Builder Kris Megna works with Champion to create houses as large as 10,000 square feet in the pricey suburbs of Boston. Megna, 31, who founded Dreamline Modular Homes in 2010, said almost any custom design is possible, even though the modules can't be much bigger than 60 feet by 16 feet. Walls between sections can be knocked down for open-concept kitchens, and cutouts can create vaulted ceilings, he said.""The house is 60% complete when it arrives, and that means 60% of the headaches of building are gone,"" Megna said.For less-expensive homes with smaller margins for developers, transportation costs can eat up the savings of going modular. Federal restrictions also limit the size of each box, or section of home being moved, which can mean more on-site construction. There's also the stigma, modular manufacturers say, that connects them to the industry's oldest relative.""Often when we exhibit a model home at trade shows, I will hear comments like 'This is nice for a trailer,'"" said Biggs of Ritz-Craft. ""Our homes are far from it, and in many ways higher-quality than those built on site.""There doesn't seem to be any stigma for customers of Connecticut Valley Homes, a builder that assembles factory-made components on lots in New England, including near the stately mansions of Greenwich. The East Lyme-based firm is ""booming at moment,"" with deposits for 42 houses, up about 50% from the same time last year, said Dave Cooper, senior building consultant. The company built only eight homes in 2011, when the housing market was hitting bottom.""Coming out of the recession, the labor pool is just lacking,"" Cooper said. ""Kids are not going to construction trade school any more — they're all playing on their computers.""That isn't necessarily a problem for Jerry Smalley, CEO of Blueprint, the Baltimore factory. He's even taking well-trained electricians and plumbers with decades of experience and putting them in front of computer screens. The company's German-made robots are more precise than humans could ever be, using techniques that Western Europeans have employed for years, according to Smalley.""Robots cut the hole,"" he said. ""But somebody still has to put the electrical box and pipes in the right places.""Instead of displacing workers — a usual side effect of automation — Blueprint's machines are creating opportunities for people like Yarborough, who wouldn't otherwise be a part of the homebuilding industry. On the factory floors, 29 production workers are operating machines that cut, sand, drill and insulate. A milling center with several different options for blades, caged in safety glass, gets to work after an employee — no hard hat needed — uploads a file that tells it exactly what to do.Yarborough said she's not interested in learning more about traditional construction. Before joining Blueprint, she took a free six-month course on computer numerical control machines, available only to unemployed or low-income adults.""I'm more interested in the engineering side,"" she said, adding that she'd like to be a part of the team that generates the design maps used by robots on the factory floor. ""I want to end up upstairs.""MORE ABOUT CONSTRUCTION:Shipping Containers Seen As Holding A Solution To HomelessnessPlay Areas, Coffee Bars: Is There A Market For 'Modular' Jets?Entrepreneurs Fit A Tiny House Into An Anti-Vacation PackageDevelopers Rehab Rust Belt Relics Into Luxury Hotels

249,MAR,"Airbnb is a fast-emerging travel accommodations disrupter valued at $25 billion — but it had a humble beginning. When co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia couldn't pay their San Francisco rent, they bought three air mattresses and launched a website to rent each mattress for $80 a night. When they found takers, the proverbial light bulb went off.The company runs a website where traveler ""hosts"" rent their homes and apartments — or rooms in their homes and apartments — to travelers for short stays of usually a month or less. Airbnb generated Q3 revenue of $340 million on bookings of $2.2 billion, according to a presentation to investors leaked to the Wall Street Journal.The company is losing some $150 million a year, reported the WSJ, but it's also nipping at the heals of online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), upending hotel chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR) and helping establish a regulatory beachhead in the 34,000 cities where it boasts listings, which could also help rivals such as HomeAway (AWAY).""The online travel agencies and (Priceline's) Bookings.com in particular have said they are happy to let Airbnb blaze the (regulatory) trail and bear a lot of those costs,"" Douglas Quinby, an analyst with online travel research firm Phocuswright, told IBD. ""The big OTAs see opportunities, but they would prefer to let Airbnb drive the regulations.""Airbnb's staunchly Democratic home city of San Francisco has been a battlefield for crafting regulations for Airbnb and similar businesses. Those regulations include requiring such firms to pay hotel taxes and limiting how long hosts can rent out their homes or apartments.Critics have hammered on the company's strategy of begging for forgivingness vs. asking for permission, meaning they start up operations in a city and only respond to concerns as they surface.But the company notched a big win in a November election, when San Francisco voters resoundingly rejected Proposition F, a restrictive measure that, among other provisions, would force Airbnb to provide a quarterly report saying how many days hosts had listed their properties for rent. Prop F would have limited that 75 days a year, and make violations a misdemeanor.After the dust settled, with Airbnb spending $8 million to defeat the item, the question remains: What does the vote mean for Airbnb and the travel industry?""On the one hand, it's an important win in a key market — the birthplace of Airbnb,"" Quinby said. ""On the other hand, it's kind of meaningless because regulations are all being decided on a local level. And there's no reason to think that because San Francisco does one thing, someone else wouldn't do another.""OTAs Say Impact 'Immaterial'On Oct. 29, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshaki brushed off Airbnb's impact on his company, speaking on Expedia's earnings conference call. Less than a week later, Expedia announced an agreement to acquire the closest thing Airbnb has to a competitor in public markets: HomeAway. Unlike Airbnb, HomeAway's focus is more tightly centered around renting out entire homes for long vacations. HomeAway, founded in 2005, is valued near $3.48 billion and is expected to end the year with revenue of $500 million. But unlike Airbnb, HomeAway makes money. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate it will end 2015 with an operating profit of $102.5 million.Expedia decline to comment for this story.""It's disingenuous to say that (Airbnb is) not having an impact,"" T. Rowe Price (TROW) portfolio manager Joe Fath told IBD. ""I tend to pay attention to what companies do, instead of what they say.""Fath manages T. Rowe Price's Growth Stock Fund .The fund bought private stock in Airbnb more than two years ago and has hiked its stake's value some 150% since then. Fath is looking for a ""home run"" from Airbnb. ""Supply is Airbnb's biggest constraint,"" he said.Analyst Quinby agrees.""Without question Airbnb has been a phenomenon in the travel industry over the last several years,"" he said. ""They've created an entirely new category in the travel industry. In 2011, 10% of U.S. travelers stayed in private accommodations. In 2014, that number was up to 25%.""For a second straight year, an RBC Capital Markets survey found that one-third of respondents said they have used some form of alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb or HomeAway subsidiary VRBO.One of Fath's largest holdings is Priceline, which he acknowledged hasn't been performing that well in the last 12 months. But he expects the stock will perform better.Also, Priceline is ""well hedged"" against Airbnb and similar firms because of its growing inventory of alternative lodgings, says RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. In a recent research note, he said Priceline's inventory of 361,000 properties is up 80% over the past year.Hyper-Local Regulations BattleThe regulations fight for short-term rentals is hyper local. The hotels and short-term rentals field isn't regulated federally and there are few state laws, so companies must work with each municipality. But while the impact of the San Francisco vote was geographically limited, it was closely watched because of the precedent it would set.Airbnb ""needed to fight this because ... if Proposition F passed, it would have stymied their ability to do business,"" Ed Zitron, an SF-based tech public relations executive uninvolved in the Prop F election, told IBD. ""A defeat would have ... scared investors.""The Airbnb win was a loss for the hotel industry, which led the fight to pass the measure. Still, the benefit of Prop F is that a lot of issues got aired ""in a public forum,"" Troy Flanagan, vice president of state and local affairs for the American Hotel and Lodging Association, told IBD. ""This is one of the first times, if not the first time, such a comprehensive proposal for online, modern short-term rentals was floated. It was a public, open debate in the hometown of Airbnb.""People renting out multiple units are hoteliers, but they aren't being held to the same standards (as hoteliers).""Airbnb, in fact, says it currently collects taxes only in 24 cities in two states, according to a spokesman.When IBD asked Airbnb what the stakes were in the Prop F vote, company spokesman Christopher Nulty wrote in an email that ""Proposition F was a hotel-funded campaign attempting to scare San Franciscans into believing this measure would do a single thing to address affordability in San Francisco. We remain committed to working with policymakers across the country and around the globe to develop smart, common sense regulations that allow regular people to share their homes while contributing to their communities.""Airbnb declined to make any executive available for this story. But CEO Chesky told Re/Code that losing the S.F. vote would have hurt. ""... You can win 10 cities in Europe but you lose your home city and it basically just seems like you're losing ground completely,"" Re/Code quoted Chesky saying. ""We have 130,000 members (hosts and guests) in San Francisco. They ended up winning the ballot, not us. I used to say they're on the ballot, not us. Because we're going to be in 33,999 cities and they're the ones really at stake here, for us it's more of a brand issue.""Affordable housing is a huge issue in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area amid skyrocketing rents and home prices, so renting out a room can help a homeowner.HomeAway says its preferred tactic is to train property owners and managers to lobby their city governments, rather than get embroiled in a Prop F-type election.""That's our traditional path,"" Matt Curtis, HomeAway's director of government relations, told IBD. ""We don't do campaign donations.""Curtis agrees with Airbnb that Prop F was too restrictive, and he says HomeAway wants to ensure ""fair and effective"" regulations in cities where the company operates.""Communities that have chosen to make burdensome restrictions have driven short-term rental activity underground,"" Curtis said. So, those businesses are ""not paying taxes, operating outside the existing framework.""

266,MAR,"Productivity and focus go hand in hand. It's easier to boost your output and retain information if you're operating in a distraction-free environment.Distractions take many forms. Some are self-imposed; with one click, your computer or mobile device can whisk you away to an online universe of endless diversion.But other irritants are beyond your control — from noisy neighbors to visual stimuli swirling around you. Shut down such intrusions through a mix of careful planning and sheer will — and you're more apt to stay the course.To minimize work-sapping distractions:Create a new baseline. When it comes to noise, it's the sudden onslaught of shrill sounds that mar our ability to concentrate. Blocking such unwelcome bursts of sound can work wonders.""Some people wear headphones with nondistracting music,"" said Anne Perschel, an executive coach in Worcester, Mass. ""Constant low-level background noise is not a distraction"" compared with a co-worker who occasionally erupts in raucous laughter or a contractor who periodically drills holes or hammers nails.Dissuade drop-by visitors. Before you plunge into a project that demands peace and quiet, signal to others that you're off-limits. Better yet, let them know when you'll be available.An organizational psychologist, Perschel recalls working among cubicle mates who would sling plastic cords across their doors to signify ""do not disturb."" Affixing a whiteboard to your door to let drop-by visitors jot a note can also help.Face a wall. Position your chair so that you're looking toward a wall, not the doorway. If you see passersby from the corner of your eye, you may struggle to stay focused.""Walls can eliminate visual distractions,"" Perschel said. ""If you set up your desk so that you see an open door, you're setting yourself up to be distracted. As soon as somebody walks by, that's a different stimulus, like lightning in the sky"" that you cannot help but notice.Assess the lighting. A strong fluorescent light — or other harsh illumination that envelops your workspace — can prove overpowering. That's especially true if you are surrounded by glass or another type of high-gloss or reflective wall surface that makes you wince from the glaring light.""Flickering lights can change the stimulation as well,"" Perschel said. Ideally, you want to let in natural light or at least use bulbs that reduce oppressive glare.Simplify your screen. You're more likely to shove aside distractions if you prevent clutter from overtaking your workstation. But maintaining a tidy desk is only part of the challenge.""If you're using a screen to do one thing, shut down other screens that are not relevant to your goal,"" said Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""And shut down your email program and tabs.""When Gazzaley reserves an hour for his writing, he will prepare by quitting his email program. Otherwise, he's tempted to check his incoming messages.Build in breaks. Taking periodic breaks can boost your concentration when it counts. Mentally disengaging from the task at hand — at least for a few minutes — provides a refreshing splash of rejuvenation.Co-author of ""The Distracted Mind,"" Gazzaley likes to take a short walk or do light exercise or meditation when he cannot summon what he calls ""sustained attention"" for a full hour of demanding work.""Just make sure you take a real break,"" he said. ""Lock down your tech exposure. Take a break from social media as well.""MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:9 Ways To Stay On Track And Reach Your Goals7 Ways To Vanquish Self-Defeating Habits6 Moves Toward Becoming More Inspired8 Ideas For Refreshing Your Message To Customers

Hilton (HLT) was in buy range from a 60.59 buy point.Besides travel, Chinese and homebuilding stocks were making group advances.Baozun (BZUN) broke out of a seven-month pattern, clearing the 18.71 buy point in heavy volume. Shares, however, are already past the 5% buy zone from that entry. The company provides e-commerce services for brand partners, and its strength may be related to strong stock performance from partner JD.com (JD).

269,MAR,"Hotel giant Marriott International (MAR) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings late Monday. Hotel and travel stocks have been big winners in recent months.Estimates: Earnings per share of 91 cents, up 5%. Revenue should surge 40% to $5.286 billion, fueled by Marriott's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts last year.Results: EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $5.561 billion. Revenue per available room rose 3.1% in North America and worldwide in constant currency.Outlook: Marriott sees revPAR up 1%-3% worldwide in Q2 in constant currency, including a 0-2% gain in North America and 3%-5% in the rest of the world. For the full year, the hotel giant sees full-year revPAR 1%-3% growth worldwide excluding currency swings, up from prior guidance for 0.5%-2.5%.Stock: Marriott shares rose 4% to 100.22 in early after-hours action. Shares closed down 0.7% to 96.37 in the stock market today after hitting a record 97.55 intraday.Rival Hilton (HLT) fell 0.6% to 60.68 in Monday's session, holding just above a 60.59 buy zone of a flat base. Hyatt (H), which was near a 58.15 buy point of a flat base, off 1.3% to 57.30. Wyndham (WYN) edged down 0.1%, consolidating near record highs.Hotel and other travel stocks have taken off since the U.S. election, which refreshed hopes that a pro-business approach to the economy would put more money in people's wallets and get them more comfortable with traveling more frequently.Hilton and Hyatt reported strong earnings last week, while Wyndam reported blowout earnings in late April. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) shot up to a record high following its late April earnings.Meanwhile, online travel giant Priceline (PCLN) reports earnings late Tuesday. Priceline rose 26 cents to 1903.91, hitting a record intraday high. Both Marriott and Priceline headed into earnings with best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, which means they are outperforming 99% of all other stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. While you should never buy a stock on ratings alone winning stocks in history often have a 95+ CR near the start of their runs.More hotel-friendly policies and a more optimistic consumer could extend the cycle for the hotel industry, currently in its eighth year. Cycles tend to last seven to nine years, Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek said.Revenue per available room, an important industry metric, had likely peaked in 2015 but could stay positive this year and next. Still, the growth of hotels' supply of rooms has been limited in recent years. Many hotels have been reluctant to expand lodging since the recession, and creditors have been hesitant to extend credit.IBD'S TAKE: As President Trump's administration considers tougher vetting measures to people traveling to the U.S. and slaps electronics restrictions on some U.S.-bound flights, Gulf carriers have pulled back on flying to the U.S.As the current cycle enters its later stages, Wasiolek said he would be on the lookout for any Q1 commentary from Marriott around the strength of leisure travel, which tends to pick up first when sentiment turns around, followed by corporate demand and conventions.But Marriott has been doing many other things right as well, Wasiolek said, things that were perhaps punctuated by its Starwood acquisition.The company has done a nice job offering ""select-service"" lodging, he said. That is, hotels that offer a room, and maybe a bar, that appeal to millennials who would rather spend more time exploring the surrounding territory than being pampered in a full-service resort.Marriott also has hefty exposure to the U.S. and among the biggest loyalty programs in the business, Wasiolek added. That program has the potential attract not just travelers but smaller, third-party hotel operators looking to enter the Marriott fold through licensing or other agreements to expand their reach.""It's probably just the fact that maybe people are coming to realize that Marriott, with the acquisition of Starwood, was already a well-positioned company. Now it's even more so,"" Wasiolek said.Marriott management has said the Trump administration's attempted travel restrictions, which have targeted a handful of largely Muslim nations, have hurt demand. But the financial impact, at least, could be minimal, or offset by in the U.S. tax cuts and better consumer confidence, Wasiolek said.And if nothing else, the political rallies that have taken place since President Trump's election could also be good for the hotel business.In a research note last week, Instinet analyst Harry Curtis said business had picked up in the first quarter in part due to ""better-than-anticipated demand level surrounding the inauguration of President Trump, political rallies in D.C., and the Easter holiday shift.""The American Hotel & Lodging Association, whose members include Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt, reportedly plans a public relations and lobbying push criticizing Priceline and Expedia (EXPE), accusing them of monopolistic behavior.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

The guide is supposedly useful for sorting out ""the most common myths"" and has ""the perfect response for each of them.""Thanks, guys, for spreading misery all across the country. Our Thanksgiving holiday should be a time for joy and reflection, but the Democrats want to turn it into a war zone, where family members are pitted against each otherThis is, naturally, a theme for the party. Two years ago it tried to mar Christmas with Pajama Boy, that effete and effeminate fellow who wanted us all to spend Christmas talking about ObamaCare. Simply put, Democrats don't have any use for a civil society, where individuals make their own choices and voluntarily work together. They want us to live in a political society, in which decisions are made by a political process and coercion is the tool of organization.This does nothing but divide the American people and set us on the path to mob rule, where the strongest gang brings down the law and forces everyone else to live by it, the U.S. Constitution and timeless, universal principles be damned.It's discouraging, but the truth is that we have strayed far from the road we were on when George Washington proclaimed that Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, would be a day of ""public thanksgiving and prayer"" devoted to ""the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.""Maybe what we should be most grateful for this year is the fact that things aren't actually worse than they are, and hope that next year our gratitude is a joyful response to the fact that the candidate from the party of political society wasn't elected president earlier in the month.

313,MAR,"Leftist protesters around the country used the tax deadline on April 18 as an occasion to hold rallies demanding the release of President Trump's tax returns. They could use large inflatable chickens and signs with hammers and sickles saying ""Show us your rubles"" and no journalist would be offended.Knowing the president, this will have all the effectiveness of national rallies that demand we get transcripts of Hillary Clinton's six-figure speeches. It's unlikely.But the Saturday network newscasts promoted the anti-Trump ""resistance"" without really noting that it's a bit strange for left-wingers to be protesting on taxes, unless they think rates are dangerously low. CBS correspondent Errol Barnett announced, ""As nationwide Tax Day protests reached the sunny streets of West Palm Beach, Florida, today, President Trump spent time at his International Golf Club and Mar-a-Lago resort nearby.""On ABC, they acknowledged ""violent clashes"" among protesters in California, and anchor Tom Llamas promoted the wave, saying, ""There were about 150 Tax Day protests demanding to see the president's tax returns, even at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort."" NBC led the whole newscast on the protests, including the violence that erupted in Berkeley.Something was missing in all of this protest publicity: the notion that the protesters weren't a real grass-roots movement. Liberal journalists are always happy to see liberal protesters boosting any mob that matches their ideals. Because they are liberal, they are always presented as authentic, diverse and representative of the public, regardless of the last election's results. It can be rigidly organized by MoveOn and other leftist groups, but it will be painted as spontaneous.But rewind to eight years ago: While the networks covered conservative Tax Day protests against then-President Obama, the emphasis was on how phony they were.ABC reporter Dan Harris suggested the protesters were AstroTurf ""cheered on by Fox News and talk radio."" As opposed to ""authentic"" organizers cheered by ABC, CBS and NBC? Harris added: ""Critics on the left say this is not a real grassroots phenomenon at all, that it's actually largely orchestrated by people fronting for corporate interests. ... While the Boston Tea Party in 1773 was about taxation without representation, critics point out that today's protesters did get to vote — they just lost.""CBS reporter Dean Reynolds announced that while ""a fistful of rightward-leaning websites and commentators embraced the cause. ... fresh polling indicates there is not all that much passion about high taxes in the country at large right now. Gallup this week found 61% of Americans see their federal income taxes as fair.""On NBC, Lee Cowan reported that ""organizers insist today's tea parties were organic uprisings of like-minded taxpayers from both parties,"" but ""some observers suggest not all of it was as homegrown as it may seem."" His ""observer"" was colleague Chuck Todd, who didn't exactly have his finger on the 2010 pulse. Earlier that day, Todd insisted that the idea of these ""so-called tea parties ... hasn't really caught on.""Oops. Wishful thinking trumped reporting.The networks also spent the Obama years ignoring how the tea party was motivated by historically enormous trillion-dollar deficits. Facts like those were stubborn things. Journalists felt it was best to navigate around them as the ""news"" consisted of congratulating Obama for his ability to sing Al Green songs and his rib-tickling ObamaCare-promoting interviews with supportive comedians.It's ironic that the liberal media now accuse President Trump of lacking any principles and being indifferent to public policy matters. Perhaps after their performance in the last eight years, the anchormen should be looking in the mirror.RELATED:Now We Know, Trump Paid More Than His Fair Share Of Taxes In 2005Why Does It Cost $409 Billion To Figure Out What We Owe In Taxes?Trump Needs A Big Win On The Board, Here's How To Get One

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.1%, stung by Nike's (NIKE) 7% plunge. The small-cap Russell 2000 bowed 0.2% lower. Volume in the stock market today fell on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly up in the Dow Jones industrial average. Advancers led declining issues by a 4-3 ratio.Microsoft (MSFT) led the Dow stocks with a 1.3% gain as it bounced off its 50-day line in soft volume. The stock is working on a flat pattern. The potential buy point is the left-side high plus 10 cents, or 66.01.Apple (AAPL) wasn't far behind. The stock popped 1% higher in below-average volume. Apple is just above a 141.12 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern. The three-weeks-tight is a bullish pattern that can provide a secondary buy area.Nike's loss came after the company reported a beat on quarterly earnings but a miss on revenue.In the S&P 500, lodging chain Marriott International (MAR) scored the biggest percentage gain, up almost 3% in strong volume. The stock cleared a consolidation that was too short to be a legitimate base. Aggressive investors could've bought the stock as it cleared 91.17, the high plus 10 cents.

316,MAR,"XU.S. equity indexes staged a mild rebound in afternoon trading Thursday, chipping away a little more of Tuesday's sudden sell-off. But volume is running lower as Wall Street awaits a key first step in the possible overhaul of the ObamaCare legislation that extended health insurance to millions of Americans.Meanwhile, a pair of names from IBD's leisure gaming industry group — Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) — as well as one hotelier and two specialty retailers are showing uncommon strength among their peers and quite possibly deserve a spot in investors' watch lists.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were both up more than 0.1%, a step ahead of the Nasdaq composite. On Tuesday, the 30-stock Dow industrials slid 1.1%, then edged fractionally lower on Wednesday following a negative reaction to Nike's (NKE) weaker-than-anticipated report on future apparel unit orders.Other important indexes fared better. The NYSE composite, boosted by gains in diversified operations firms, banks and select retailers, rose 0.5%. The Russell 2000 gained nearly 1%.Five Below (FIVE) is one of the five consumer plays that are doing well in recent weeks. On Thursday, the stock jumped more than 11% to 42.58, piercing back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages, in volume that is already more than five times its 50-day average of 1.1 million shares.After the close on Wednesday, the Philadelphia-based chain selling popular items at $5 or less reported a 17% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter profit to 90 cents a share. That merely equaled Wall Street's consensus view, but it also stretched Five Below's run of double-digit EPS growth to six quarters. Sales gained 19% to $388.1 million, a quarterly record. Five Below debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2012 at 17 a share. The stock has been working on a new base since topping at 52.70 in late July last year. Watch to see if its RS Rating and Accumulation/Distribution, both horrible right now, improve sharply in the coming days and weeks.On the positive side, Five Below gets a positive up/down volume ratio of 1.1, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Prefer those stocks that have a ratio of 1.0 or better before a potential breakout.IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment group has jumped to No. 71 from No. 126 among 197 industry groups over the past two weeks. Helping lead the charge is Wynn Resorts, which fell about 1% to 112.25 but is still up big for the week. Shares are also up more than 7% past a 104.49 buy point within a shallow saucer base.Profits and sales have been hurt by a clampdown in gambling and lavish spending by Chinese government officials in Macau in recent years, but Wynn's top line has returned to growth mode. Revenue fell 9% in the first quarter of 2016, but then rebounded to gains of 2%, 11% and 37% in the past three quarters.Las Vegas Sands, which competes head on with Wynn both in Vegas and in the former Portuguese colony island of Macau, edged 0.2% lower to 55.73 in light trade. But the large-cap name is possibly building the right side of a new cup pattern. Also in the lodging space, Marriott International (MAR) continues to soar, even after marking a new high on Wednesday. The hotel giant rallied more than 1% to 93.48 in fast turnover and has kept above its 50-day moving average since breaking out in mid-November past a 74.09 cup buy point.Kate Spade (KATE), reported to be mulling a sale of itself to a fellow fashion apparel rival, is virtually flat at 22.94 but has also been building the right side of a long, deep cup-style base. A handle has formed with a 24.34 entry.

319,MAR,"When Donald Trump interviewed Jay Clayton to be his chief securities regulator in December, the then-president elect was fixated on the steep decline in U.S. initial public offerings.During the meeting at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump even cited statistics on the drop, which started two decades ago, said people familiar with their discussion. He was particularly concerned that more companies were choosing to sell their shares overseas, rather than on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.The conversation showed Trump's eagerness for the Securities and Exchange Commission to focus on promoting growth, after it has spent years layering tough rules on Wall Street and other industries. In Clayton, a corporate lawyer, the president has nominated an SEC chairman who should know which regulations may need loosening.""Public markets need to be more attractive,"" said David Hirschmann, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. ""We need a modern, effective regulatory system that enables growth.""While there is disagreement about how much rules are stifling markets, and even why companies are choosing to stay private, regulation has long served as a boogeyman for the chamber and other corporate lobbyists. Much of their attention has focused on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which set new restrictions for Wall Street after the financial crisis.But with Trump in the White House, Republicans controlling Congress and an SEC pick who has worked on some of the biggest IPOs, business groups see a chance to go further. They want to revisit long-standing SEC policies on what corporations must disclose to investors and chip away at onerous accounting requirements imposed more than a decade ago in response to frauds at Enron and WorldCom.A new, deregulated slant would mark a major shift in the SEC's priorities. It also would rekindle a debate that went mostly quiet in the years after the 2008 financial meltdown: Is the agency's main job to police markets and protect shareholders, or should it give more consideration to helping businesses raise capital?Clayton may have his Senate confirmation hearing next month, and Democrats are expected to press him on how to strike the right balance.Trump has made clear he sympathizes with corporate complaints. As he noted last month after picking Clayton, the SEC chief will ""play an important role in unleashing the job-creating power of our economy by encouraging investment in American companies.""The tone is troubling to investor advocates who credit an aggressive SEC for stemming a long tide of corporate wrongdoing.Over the past 15 years, the agency has imposed numerous regulations required by two major laws, Dodd-Frank and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which Congress passed in 2002 after investors lost trillions of dollars in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom failures.Mark Flannery, who stepped down as the SEC's chief economist in December, said there is always an inherent tension between adding rules to protect shareholders or easing them to goose markets.""It's a tradeoff,"" said Flannery, who is now a business professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ""The question is, what's the right balance?""Trump signed a directive in early February ordering the Treasury secretary to review financial regulations, with an eye toward identifying policies that hurt U.S. competitiveness. While his administration framed the order as an attack on Dodd-Frank, the look back is likely to go deeper and touch on Sarbanes-Oxley as well.The law has been on Trump's radar for years. It required chief executives to swear to the accuracy of their books and set new, expensive rules for auditing the internal controls companies use to catch wrongdoing. In a 2008 CNN interview, the then-real estate mogul and reality TV star, said Sarbanes-Oxley was a classic case of government overreach, noting ""it really puts this country at a competitive disadvantage.""Statistics do show a dramatic drop in IPOs. The best year for U.S. listings was 1996 when 863 companies sold shares amid the tech bubble, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This decade, the high-water mark was 2014, when 362 companies went public. Last year, there were just 130 U.S. IPOs, compared with 1,367 on foreign markets.Even though the decline started before Sarbanes-Oxley, the law's critics say it has played a leading role in stifling IPOs.""Those of us who opposed Sarbanes-Oxley at the time it passed, said it was going to be a disaster. And it has turned out to be,"" said Peter Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ""It is a terrible problem for our economy when we are not having companies go public.""Clayton, a partner at the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm in New York, is among those who have said regulatory burdens have put pressure on startups, though he also has cited other factors for why companies remain private. He got on Trump's radar by writing a policy paper for the transition that argued smaller companies should be exempted from some rules when they go public.Clayton declined to comment through a spokesman.In recent meetings with lawmakers and others in Washington, Clayton has shared an anecdote that he says shows the need to cut some of the SEC's regulations. Twenty years ago, when midsize companies sought his opinion on whether to go public, he advised 80% of them to go for it. Now he recommends that just 20% of the time.In 2012, Congress eased some burdens when it passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The law, which as its name suggests was designed to spur jobs, allows smaller companies relief from SEC disclosure requirements when they go public. Still, it hasn't spurred a flood of new IPOs as some lawmakers expected.Clayton, in his Washington meetings, has spoken approvingly of the Jobs Act and has said it should be expanded, the people familiar with the matter said.Some securities lawyers argue that blaming regulation oversimplifies the situation. Firms have an ever-expanding menu of ways to raise money outside the stock market. And capital is easier to keep around when companies are private and investors aren't poised to flee every time quarterly earnings miss expectations.""There's just such a deep private capital market,"" said David Lynn, a former SEC attorney who is now a partner at Morrison & Foerster.If Trump and Clayton want to make big changes to Sarbanes-Oxley, they will need Congress' help.In the House, a wide-ranging financial regulation bill could be introduced as soon as this month that would exempt more companies from Sarbanes-Oxley's internal control requirements. These audits, which are meant to ensure public companies have adequate safeguards to prevent fraud, collectively cost corporations billions of dollars annually.Once the legislative wrangling begins, business lobbyists said they will try to get lawmakers to strike down even more of Sarbanes-Oxley. Chief on their list is a mandate that CEOs certify, under the risk of criminal penalties, that their companies' financial results are accurate. Accounting firms, too, may make a push to overturn the law's so-called independence restrictions, which bar them from doing many kinds of consulting work for audit clients.Should that happen, ""it would take less than five years to get back to Enron,"" said Lynn Turner, a former SEC chief accountant who helped write Sarbanes-Oxley.""This is not how you create jobs,"" Turner said. ""That is a figment of someone's imagination.""

323,MAR,"A bout of recent investor jitters took a bite out of its shares this week, but Epam Systems continues to rank as a strong performer that shows potential.Epam (EPAM) competes with the likes of huge names in computer tech services such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN), Infosys (INFY) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH). Yet the provider of outsourced software engineering and other IT services holds its own — and often bests the other players — with a stock price that's up 50% for the year.And the company says that it's not slowing down.""We are hiring people across all locations,"" Chief Executive Arkadiy Dobkin said Thursday on an earnings call with analysts. ""Over the last 18 months, we have expanded in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. We look at this from a global perspective of how to grow clients.""Although he has an overweight rating on the stock, JPMorgan analyst Alexei Gogolev is nevertheless bullish on Epam's growth prospects. He cites its ""unique delivery capabilities and rising demand for offshoring as an underpenetrated form of IT delivery.""RoadblocksBut there are roadblocks standing in Epam's way. For one, the company's earnings report this week left a number of questions unanswered as Epam suffered a rare hiccup in an otherwise stellar run of late.Reporting after the close on Wednesday, Epam logged third-quarter adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share. That was up 17% from the prior year and 2 cents above consensus analyst views. However, revenue fell short of estimates, growing 22% to $236 million vs. estimates for $239 million.Part of the problem was currency-exchange headwinds. More than half of Epam's business comes from outside the U.S., which means the strong U.S. dollar can drag on results.The company also does a lot of business in Ukraine, where tensions with Russia have been a challenge. Meanwhile, Epam must deal with rising inflation in the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).On the analyst call, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Conte said that currency ""remains a big piece of our story, suppressing our Q3 revenue by about 8%."" He also said that a ""significant slowdown"" in the Russian banking industry, coupled with the weak ruble, hurt business in Epam's important banking/financial segment.Weakness In RussiaJPMorgan's Gogolev reiterated that point in a Thursday morning note, saying, ""Low-teens growth of the financial services vertical comes on the back of continued weakness of the Russian banking industry.""Wall Street's reaction was negative. Leading up to the Wednesday report, Epam shares fell 4% for the day. On Thursday, investors initially panicked, sending down shares more than 11% in early trades. But the market thought better of it, and Epam pared its losses to 5% by the close, ending the day at 71.69.Those investors may be noting that even with the revenue miss, Epam's results continued a streak of 12 straight quarters of double-digit per-share earnings and revenue growth. Epam shares touched a record high of 81.95 on Oct. 7.That kind of strong, consistent growth has made Epam one of the top stocks in IBD's Computer-Technology Services group, which ranks No. 3 out of 197 industries tracked. Epam can't match IBM, Accenture, Infosys and Cognizant for billions of dollars in annual revenue. But it's the leader of the pack in the Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating, with a best-possible score of 99.Epam provides outsourced software engineering and other IT services to clients worldwide, though most of its business is in North America and Europe. Its portfolio of services includes product and application development, technology consulting, infrastructure and hosting, application testing, and maintenance and support. End markets include banking and finance — its biggest — as well as retail, travel, media and entertainment, software, technology, health care and life sciences.Buying And GrowingEpam has used a combination of organic growth and acquisitions to more than double its revenue over the past three years and gain more market share.Its latest buyout came in July, when it acquired NavigationArts, a digital consulting and content management firm with clients including Marriott International (MAR), privately held Ernst & Young and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Epam's biggest client is Swiss financial giant UBS (UBS), which accounts for more than $100 million in annual revenue. That's a pretty big chunk, considering that analysts expect Epam's 2015 revenue to be about $910 million.Its revenue from UBS rose more than 20% during the third quarter, Conte said on the conference call.""The growth there remains solid and strong. It was pretty much in line with what we expected it to be,"" he said. Conte noted that growth wasn't limited to just UBS, adding, ""We continue to gain traction and grow our business with the top clients.""The company says that revenue from Epam's top five customers grew about 20% from a year earlier, while revenue from the top 10 grew about 25%.In terms of geographic markets, Conte said, North America ""continues to be our strongest sector,"" helped by the strong U.S. dollar. ""We are seeing growth across all verticals in North America.""On the downside, Epam has now reported two straight quarters of decelerating revenue growth, which analyst Gogolev said ""may be partially explained by tougher (year-over-year) comps.""Still, the company continues to expand its operation and payroll. It ended the quarter with around 14,000 information technology professionals.Such expansion should help Epam continue its strong financial gains. It expects year-over-year revenue growth to be ""at least"" 30% this year. The company also said that its full-year EPS should be ""at least"" $2.65. That's below the $2.69 expected from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters but would still represent a 19% gain.

325,MAR,"Thomas Francis Meagher fought many battles to help his fellow Irish.Though born to a wealthy merchant family, Meagher (pronounced ""mar"") helped lead a failed rebellion against British rule in 1848. Convicted of treason, he was sent to a penal colony in Tasmania, Australia, for life, but escaped to New York City four years later.He spoke out against anti-Irish discrimination, then rallied his community to back the Union during the Civil War. Brig. Gen. Meaher led the Irish Brigade that distinguished itself in many of the bloodiest battles.""In (Meagher) we see the entire arc of so much crucial Irish-American history in one man's life — persecution, famine, banishment, exile, revival, and finding your place in a strange land,"" Timothy Egan, author of ""The Immortal Irishman,"" told IBD. ""During Irish-American Heritage Month, we should remember that these poor immigrants were once considered scum and filled our jails. They were told they were too clannish, too contentious, too Catholic, and didn't belong. The triumph of the Irish is finding joy, of persevering in the face of centuries of misery, a universal story born in a great struggle.""Meagher (1823-67) was born into a Catholic family in Waterford, Ireland, where his father had a thriving trading business with North America. At 17, he was sent to a Jesuit college in Lancashire, England.""Unlike most Irish Catholics of his generation, he was afforded an excellent education and read voraciously,"" said Roger McGrath, author of ""Gunfighters, Highwaymen and Vigilantes."" ""This and an extraordinarily quick mind enabled him to perform brilliantly in debating societies, and his oratorical eloquence carried him to a leadership role in the Young Irelander movement.""In 1843, Meagher went to Dublin to study the law and became involved in the movement to repeal the Act of Union of 1800, which united Britain and Ireland. He became radicalized when Ireland's main source of food, the potato, was wiped out by a blight in 1847, followed by a weak harvest the following year, causing the deaths of 1 million and driving another million into exile.Meagher and his comrades were outraged because there was plenty of other food on the island and the British government refused to keep it from being exported. Despite the fact that Ireland had a British garrison larger than colonial India, the Young Irelanders tried to foment a revolt among the starving peasants.When Meagher, 25, and three others were tried, he spoke to the jury: ""You may deem this language unbecoming in me, and perhaps it may seal my fate, but I am here to crave with no lying lip the life I consecrate to the liberty of my country. … Judged by the law of England, I know this crime entails upon me the penalty of death; but the history of Ireland explains that crime and justifies it.""They were sentenced to be hanged, but worldwide protests resulted in life sentences to that island at the end of the British Empire, where half the 65,000 residents were convicts.When Meagher arrived in New York City in 1852, after his escape, 20% of its population was Irish and most lived in slums. He was in demand as a speaker for Ireland's independence and published the weekly Irish News. He became a lawyer and helped provide a successful defense in a high-profile murder trial.As the debate over slavery heated up, Meagher was initially sympathetic to the South, influenced by friends whom he had visited there. He was, however, a staunch Unionist, as was the Catholic Church, and when South Carolina seceded in April 1861, he saw an opportunity for Irish Americans to get military training that could be valuable later in liberating Ireland.His offer to recruit a company of Irish was accepted, but his 1,000 men had only minimal training when they were sent to the First Battle of Bull Run in July. They arrived in Virginia without much sleep, food or medical supplies and soon joined the retreat by the Union Army. Meagher was knocked out when his horse fell and he was carried from the field, but was praised for his valor in leading from the front.He returned to New York to recruit what became known as the Fighting Irish Brigade and was made a brigadier general in February 1862, one of only 700 generals commanding 2.5 million Northern soldiers during the war. He developed a close relationship with President Abraham Lincoln, who saw him as the key to Irish support for the war, but Meagher had an increasingly difficult relationship with his Army superior, Gen. William Sherman, whom he accused of being anti-Irish and using his men as cannon fodder.The Irish Brigade was severely tested during the Seven Days Battles in June 1862, as the Army tried to take Richmond, Va., the capital of the Confederate States of America. The terrain was swampy and Southern troops were well-entrenched. In ""The Irish General,"" Paul Wylie wrote that one reporter described Meagher as ""indefatigable … all the time under fire,"" and he returned a hero.The Northern public had been led to believe the rebels would be quickly beaten, and early Union defeats made Meagher's recruitment efforts for his decimated brigade much harder. But like Lincoln, he came to believe that the war was not simply about the cause of reunification, but about ending slavery and giving African Americans the vote.At Antietam, Md., in September, during Gen. Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North, the Union troops achieved a costly victory, with 3,000 from both sides killed, wounded, captured, or missing on the bloodiest day in U.S. military history. Meagher had his horse shot from under him and was carried from the field. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Va., in December, Meagher directed repeated assaults, earning Lee's admiration. Meagher had entered the battle with 1,200 men and only 280 survived, while he spent the next four months recovering from a cannonball wound to the leg.Meagher's protests about the way Irish-American soldiers were being treated prompted Sherman and his allies to claim that he had been drunk on the battlefield. His officers signed letters strongly supporting him as their commander. Furious, Meagher tendered his resignation in May 1863, but it was rejected in December and he returned to command at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Va., in April 1864, where his men were tasked with keeping Union soldiers from fleeing the fighting.Meagher's final assignment in September was to protect railroads in Tennessee with 10,000 convalescing soldiers. When he was ordered to move 6,500 south and the operation was botched due to poor communications, Sherman pushed for his dismissal. Having lost his protector when Lincoln was assassinated in April, Meagher resigned the next month.President Andrew Johnson appointed Meagher to be acting governor of the Montana Territory, where he arrived in September 1865. He did his best to try to get things done, despite infighting by bitter political factions, vigilantes, Indian attacks, settler reprisals, inability to conclude viable new treaties, miners who disregarded existing treaties, budget shortfalls, and hostility toward Irish Americans.In July 1867, Meagher took a Missouri River steamboat to retrieve a shipment of guns at Fort Benton. He either fell overboard or was pushed by some of his many enemies and his body was never recovered.But he was not forgotten: The founders of the Irish Republic often quoted his eloquent calls for the island's independence. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy addressed its parliament and told the story of Meagher's Irish Brigade, then presented the flag that they had always carried into battle.Led the Union Army's Irish Brigade during the American Civil War.Overcame: Banishment to Australia; bigotry; resistance among America's Irish community to backing the Union cause.Lesson: Read widely and prepare extensively to communicate effectively and persuasively; support your words with actions.""A good government may, indeed, redress the grievances of an injured people, but a strong people can alone build up a great nation.""MORE ABOUT LEADERSHIP:Dangerous Sam Adams Put A Revolutionary Vision Into ActionJoseph Warren Died A Hero At The Battle of Bunker HillGen.

327,MAR,"The fight over the border tax has been focused entirely on the impact a 20% tax would have on big importers. Supporters insist that retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) wouldn't really be hurt, because currencies would adjust to neutralize the tax.Yet, while the predicted 25% rise in the dollar isn't certain — it could rise by somewhat less or even more — it's curious that there's been almost no attention paid to the potential impact on the one industry that's likely to bear the brunt of a currency adjustment: U.S. tourism.Tourism Economics estimates that each 10% rise in the dollar causes a 2% decrease in international visitors. On top of that, visitors may shorten their average stay and otherwise limit their spending.International travelers could find that visiting a Disney (DIS) theme park, gambling at an MGM Resorts (MGM) casino, staying at a Marriott (MAR) hotel or shopping at Tiffany (TIF) would be much more expensive.Staying at a Trump International Hotel would be more expensive too, which might influence President Trump's view that the dollar is already ""too strong"" and is ""killing us."" Just how much more expensive would depend on the extent to which reduced travel leads tourism-related industries to lower prices.Another hit would come from increased overseas travel by Americans, who would find that their dollars go much further in London, Paris, Rome and other destination spots around the world and opt against a U.S. vacation.International carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) may not suffer as much, since more outbound American travelers could ease the pain of fewer U.S.-bound tourists. Similarly, global hotel chains like Marriott may also see additional bookings by Americans abroad. But more domestic-focused businesses won't have such offsets.A major, unilateral increase in the U.S. currency could come at a pretty significant price. International travel added $247 billion to the U.S. economy last year and generated an $88 billion surplus, relative to what Americans spent abroad, according to the U.S. Travel Association's analysis of Commerce Department data. That's down from a $98 billion travel surplus in 2015. It's not clear how much of the narrower surplus was related to a stronger dollar, but there is generally a lag before shifts in currencies affect travel, given advance bookings.The figures include educational tourism — foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities and generally paying much more than local residents to do so. With a 25% rise in the dollar, the U.S. might not look like quite as an attractive place to study. In 2015, education-related tourism totaled $35.8 billion.""Regular exporters would, under border adjustment, receive a subsidy that would offset the exchange rate impact; but hotel owners presumably wouldn't,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Stan Veuger. ""Or would U.S. taxpayers start subsidizing the vacations of Chinese tourists?""That seems as unlikely as federal government subsidies to let foreign students attend the University of California at Berkeley, he adds.While the impact on tourism has been almost entirely absent from the debate, it could play a bigger role as GOP senators decide whether they can back the House plan. Georgia Sen. David Perdue, former CEO of Dollar General (DG), has already signaled his fierce opposition, meaning just two more GOP defections could kill it.Expect Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who both represent top-five states for foreign travel, to come under heavy lobbying pressure from the tourism industry. Border states Texas and Arizona also are big tourism destinations, with Mexican travelers spending $19.7 billion in the U.S. in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: If the dollar appreciates 20% to 25% against foreign currencies, U.S. investors holding ADRs of foreign equities like Alibaba or international ETFs would take a hit.The projected rise in the dollar would come from already lofty levels. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced-economy currencies, surged 26% from July 2014 to March 2015, hitting the highest level since 2003.On earnings calls in the fall of 2015, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide noted ""lower volumes of inbound international travelers due to the strong dollar,"" while Tiffany said it ""continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S.""While the dollar eased off of those levels for most of 2016, it has strengthened again on expectations for a stronger U.S. economy under Trump.AEI's Veuger also points out that real estate is another ""quasi-exporting"" industry that might feel an impact from the border tax, since foreigners purchase some $100 billion worth of residential properties in a year, about half paid for in cash.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

328,MAR,"Donald Trump didn't look very far when searching for infrastructure advisors. He turned to two Manhattan real estate developers he has known for decades, Richard LeFrak and Steven Roth.LeFrak, a billionaire whose New York roots mirror Trump's own, and Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), one of the city's largest landlords, will spearhead a committee dedicated to one of the new administration's signature campaign pledges. Trump's relationships with the two men, who will lead a council of builders and engineers to monitor spending, crisscross New York in a web of personal and professional ties.The extent of their power and the risk of conflict aren't clear. Vornado is the biggest property owner in the area surrounding Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station and could benefit from increased infrastructure spending.While Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the council would reject some projects and expand others, that's usually the province of local officials. He hasn't articulated a plan beyond broad statements promising as much as $1 trillion in spending, including private investment, to improve roads, bridges and other public works. In an interview last month with CNBC, LeFrak said he anticipated a tug of war with Republicans in Congress concerned about deficits and that $550 billion was a more reasonable estimate.""Part of our assignment is to advise him as best we can on the merits of these different things,"" LeFrak said. ""There's no simple answer.""LeFrak isn't discussing the council further because it hasn't been formed yet, according to his spokesman, Steve Solomon. A spokeswoman for Roth declined to comment. A White House spokesman said he couldn't provide any details about the council or its role.Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said on Feb. 14 that an infrastructure package won't be released until after the House wraps up its proposals on taxes and to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.""I am honored that he has asked me,"" Roth said of Trump on a Feb. 14 conference call with analysts. ""Infrastructure matters are not political. Every citizen of America wants our infrastructure to be robust, to be in a good state of repair, so that we can be competitive and we can have the right quality of life.""LeFrak, 71, and Trump, 70, are both scions of families that made fortunes owning apartment buildings on the outskirts of Manhattan. The LeFrak real estate dynasty traces its origins to 1905, when Richard LeFrak's grandfather Harry emigrated to the U.S. from Palestine. The family business grew to become one of the largest residential landlords in New York and New Jersey, best known for building an eponymous apartment complex in Queens.Through the years, LeFrak has had cameos in Trump's life, serving as a Miss Universe judge in 2009 and appearing in a 2010 episode of ""The Apprentice."" In Trump's 1997 book ""The Art of the Comeback,"" he praises Richard LeFrak while disparaging his father, Sam LeFrak, who had tussled with Trump. The younger LeFrak has been a frequent guest at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Fla., according to a 2007 profile in the New York Times.Roth's relationship with Trump goes back at least to the early 1980s, when the two men acquired stakes in Alexander's (ALX) during a takeover battle for the department-store chain. Roth prevailed, seizing on the value of the company's real estate — including what is now the Manhattan headquarters of Bloomberg — and turning it into a $35 billion real estate empire. Trump lost his stake to Citibank (C) in bankruptcy court in the 1990s.In 2007, Roth was Trump's partner in a deal that tied up the loose ends of the future president's failed attempt to turn a 77-acre tract of land on the West Side of Manhattan into what would have been New York's biggest development since Rockefeller Center. After publicly feuding with Mayor Ed Koch and spurning an offer from developer William Zeckendorf Jr. to buy the undeveloped plot, Trump was forced by bankers to cede control of the site to a group of Hong Kong investors. Proceeds from the sale were eventually used to acquire 1290 Avenue of the Americas in New York and 555 California St. in San Francisco, leaving Trump with minority stakes in the two office buildings.Vornado bought out the controlling partners after Trump sued them, and it assumed potential liabilities from the lawsuit. Roth, 75, referenced his long-standing friendship with Trump when explaining the deal in an annual letter to shareholders. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed. Trump's stake in the two towers is now worth about $640 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making it his most valuable asset.More recently, Vornado swooped in when Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior White House advisor, was fighting to hold on to 666 Fifth Ave., a Manhattan tower he acquired at the height of the property bubble in 2007. Kushner was on the verge of defaulting on $1.1 billion of loans in 2011 when Vornado injected $80 million into the 39-story building as part of a deal to stave off Kushner's creditors. Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009, recently sold his stake in 666 Fifth Ave. to a family trust of which he isn't a beneficiary to comply with conflict-of-interest rules.Roth and LeFrak have their own history together. The developers jointly own a parcel of land on West 57th Street, near Central Park, where they leveled three prewar buildings in the past two years and plan to build what they describe as a seven-star hotel.The relationship between Roth and LeFrak will help smooth decision-making when it comes to infrastructure spending, according to Steven Witkoff, a Manhattan developer who has known Trump, Roth and LeFrak for 30 years. They know how to speak to one another, and they're both regarded as savvy stewards of their real estate empires, he said.""Risk management is going to be the order of the day,"" Witkoff said. ""Trump is not just appointing this slot to two billionaires. They have shown a unique ability to manage risk.""With exceptions such as projects on federal land, state and local entities typically control infrastructure and decide what work proceeds, said Jim Tymon, chief operating officer of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Trump's council could help review high-profile projects and possibly decide which get additional funding or financing, he said.It's not unheard of for developers to have a seat at the table for infrastructure planning. Many of the skills required to put together large real estate projects are transferable, such as navigating the regulatory process, gaining public support and arranging financing, according to Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR Realty, whose company owns $15 billion of real estate throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.""Real estate are seeds that are planted around infrastructure,"" Rechler, who spent five years on the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said in an interview.Vornado has been involved in attempts to redevelop Penn Station and nearby structures for more than a decade. A parallel project called the Gateway Program, which would expand the railroad network under the Hudson River, is high on a list of proposals that local officials say need additional funding.Roth's holdings around Penn Station, one of the busiest transportation hubs in North America, are more of an asset than a liability, according to Alexander Goldfarb, a real estate analyst at Sandler O'Neil & Partners. Roth's familiarity with the area, in addition to his experience working alongside government entities, gives him insight into logistical issues such as the best way to alleviate traffic jams, Goldfarb said.LeFrak is partnering with Florida developer Turnberry Associates on SoLe Mia, a $4 billion project to transform a former Miami superfund site into a community with residential, office and retail properties.Roth and LeFrak are skilled at raising capital from diverse sources, which will be crucial for getting the program off the ground, according to Witkoff. Being able to show private investors predictable returns can be a challenge for infrastructure projects.""These guys are experts at financial structuring,"" Witkoff said. ""They understand incentives and how debt and equity come together and what it's going to take to get people interested in infrastructure.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In AmericaTrending Home Improvement Projects For 2017's Housing MarketHomebuying Cheaper Than Renting In Most Of U.S., But For How Long?

334,MAR,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning vs. fair value ahead of notable economic data and comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.XThe Nasdaq composite led Monday's selling, testing its 50-day moving average as Facebook (FB) plunged through that key support, Tesla (TSLA) triggered multiple sell signals and Apple (AAPL) kept falling.Meanwhile, a large number of mostly tech breakouts joined Apple and Tesla underwater, including Alibaba (BABA), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). The Nasdaq composite slid 0.9%, while the big-cap Nasdaq skidded 1.1%, below its 50-day. But the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials lost just 0.2%.S&P 500 index futures rose a fraction Tuesday morning above fair value, Dow futures were up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%.August new-home sales data and the Consumer Confidence Index for September will released at 10 a.m. ET. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will give the keynote speech at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics in Cleveland at 12:45 p.m. ET, with several other Fed officials set to speak today.Tech stocks, especially longtime big-cap leaders like Facebook, are having a rough go right now. But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well. Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are among those in buy zones. General Dynamics (GD) is close.Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), and Hyatt Hotels (H) are among several hotel operators that have broken out. But they've generally broken out on light-to-lackluster volume. Casino stocks have been doing well, though Melco Resorts (MLCO) fell below a buy point and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nearly did so.D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) are all near buy points.On a related note, Home Depot crept out to a buy point on Monday, but in below-average volume.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Stocks Crushed As Nasdaq Reaches A Key TestWhy Tesla May Not Be Leading This Part Of The Self-Driving Race75 Recent Breakouts, And This Stock Is The Biggest Winner So Far?New High Analysis: Nasdaq Sell-Off Spares These 7 StocksFacebook Down As Zuckerberg Scraps Stock Plan, Will Sell Shares

335,MAR,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting. Fidelity added exposure to big banks Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) by boosting share counts 4.4% and 3.8% respectively.But Fidelity cut share counts in Goldman Sachs (GS) by 9.8%, in Morgan Stanley (MS) by 8.1%, in Wells Fargo (WFC) by 7.9%, and in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 7.5%.It also trimmed share count in credit card network Mastercard (MA) by 2.2%.The $39.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) and $22.7 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) both held top-10 positions in Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) as of June 30, Rosenbluth reported.TIPS & TOOLS:Is this a good time to buy Fidelity's top holdings?

346,MAR,"Boeing (BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said Tuesday he ""made some great progress"" in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect's demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One.In addition to Boeing's contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet.""We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,"" Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. ""We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.""Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of ""the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,"" although no specific reductions have yet been announced.""I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business,"" Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. ""We're on the same page here.""Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, Muilenburg touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports.""You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest,"" Muilenburg said. ""We're proud to take on that mission.""Trump's public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that ""Boeing is building a brand-new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!""In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion.""We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens,"" Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his ""personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.""More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft.Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for ""out of control costs"" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for more than 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11.Trump also called on Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,"" referring to the company's F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters.After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs ""significantly'' on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s.The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems Plc, a key subcontractor on the program.""Over a period there's no question we've been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,"" Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. ""We respect that and we'll work towards a contribution towards that.""At the time of Trump's tweet about Air Force One, it wasn't immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon's top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract.On Air Force One and the F-35, ""he's heard these big numbers,"" Frank Kendall said in an interview. ""Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They're not contract values, necessarily.""""The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we're buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means,"" Kendall said. ""We're still negotiating with Boeing on that.""Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts.""His general interest in reducing costs is terrific — his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics,"" Kendall said.

347,MAR,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Carnival (CCL), Expedia (EXPE) and other travel-related stocks plunged early Friday after a suspected terror attack left more than 80 people dead in southern France, but many pared losses.Delta shares fell 2.4% to 39.98 in the stock market today. The airline has the most exposure to France of any U.S. airline. American Airlines (AAL) stock erased losses and turned up 1 cent. United Continental (UAL) was off just 0.9%. All three carriers are up sharply for the week.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) shares rose 0.3%. Marriott (MAR) dipped 0.35% and Hyatt Hotels (H) turned up 0.3%.Travel booking site Expedia shares edged down 0.4%. Priceline (PCLN) shares fell 1.2%.Among cruise lines, Carnival fell 2.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) 3.7% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Most industry groups in the travel and leisure sector are well off highs, but have mounted a rebound of late. Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.

348,MAR,"Qunar's (QUNR) ongoing dispute with China's airlines won't hurt China's No. 1 online travel agent Ctrip.com (CTRP), which is expected to report March-quarter travel sales that doubled vs. last year, ITG analyst Henry Guo said.Ctrip and Qunar stocks split on the stock market today, with shares of Ctrip 1.7%, as Qunar fell 1.5%. IBD's 11-company Leisure-Travel Booking industry group was up a fraction.For Q1, Guo expects Ctrip to report 4.19 billion to 4.29 billion yuan ($640 million to $650 million), topping the consensus view for 4.16 billion yuan. Ctrip hasn't yet set a date for its Q1 earnings release.That outperformance would follow a months-long battle with flagship carrier Air China -- along with some other local airlines including Hainan Airlines and its Hong Kong Airlines unit, as well as China Eastern's Shanghai Airlines -- over fees charged by booking agents such as Qunar.Ctrip acquired a stake in Qunar after the two formed a partnership last year. In the wake of airlines' refusal to list on Qunar.com, the site now directs users to Ctrip.com or to airlines' official websites, Guo wrote in a research note.""We believe this should help drive Ctrip's organic transportation revenue growth and partially offset Qunar's air-ticketing weakness,"" he wrote.Hotel occupancy in China fell to 53.1% in Q1 from 53.6% in the prior quarter, Guo said, but revenue per available room surged 2.2% year over year, ""suggesting improved monetization for the whole hotel industry.""At the same time, he says InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) and Hilton Worldwide (HLT) reported 8.3% and 8% year-over-year growth for their Chinese operations, respectively, and Marriott International (MAR) saw revenue per available room in Asia rise 6.8% vs. last year.Guo expects Ctrip to report a 76% to 86% jump in accommodations sales vs. the year-earlier quarter, topping the company's guidance for 70%-80% growth. He sees Ctrip's travel segment more than doubling revenue.Packaged tours -- one of Ctrip's growth engines -- has benefited from outbound travel to high-demand destinations like Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, Guo wrote. Relaxed visa requirements have helped fuel outbound travel. He expects 52% year-over-year growth in this segment.

James Mattis, Trump's defense secretary nominee, backed the F-35 program, saying the fighter ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane.""Mattis also empathized that Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Other defense CEOs could be making a trip to see Trump as Huntington Ingalls Industries' (HII) aircraft carriers, General Dynamics' (GD) and Lockheed's littoral combat ships, and Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 could be the next big defense programs under fire from the president-elect.Trump ""is clearly not shy about expressing his opinions, and it's having a major effect on the defense industry,"" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told IBD Wednesday.Huntington Ingalls rose 0.3%. Northrop edged up 0.45%. General Dynamics climbed 0.8%.Trump has also blasted drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) for ""getting away with murder.""He also took aim at General Motors (GM) last week for ""sending Mexican made models of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border.""GM fought back, saying that all Cruze sedans were built in the U.S. and only a ""small number"" of Cruze hatchbacks built in Mexico are sold in the U.S.RELATED: On Pentagon Spending, Will Trump Put Your Money Where His Mouth Is?Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

351,MAR,"The 10-year Treasury yield has shed close to 30 basis points over the past month to around 2.35%, so it's not surprising to see some utilities holding their own.

352,MAR,"Sprint (S) will return 5,000 jobs to the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump said, crediting the wireless company's owner Masayoshi Son for the move.""Because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday outside his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. ""Masa and some other people were very much involved with that.""Son, the Japanese billionaire, met with Trump earlier this month and promised to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create jobs. That helped provide Trump with evidence he's producing more work for Americans while also scoring points for Sprint with the new administration.Sprint had no immediate comment. Trump also repeated an announcement earlier this month that OneWeb, a satellite startup backed by Son's SoftBank (SFTBY), will create almost 3,000 jobs in Florida over the next four years.RELATED:Battle Stations!

353,MAR,"The chief executives from Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) sought to improve ties with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday after he criticized contracts that they have with the Pentagon.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg, after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said his company could get the Air Force One planes completed for less than $4 billion.""We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens,"" Muilenberg told reporters.Trump later spoke, saying he plans to cut a ""tremendous amount"" off the contract. ""It's a dance, it's a little bit of a dance,"" he said.Trump previously took aim at Boeing on Twitter (TWTR) for the cost of its Air Force One replacement and threatened to cancel the contract. He later told reporters, ""the plane is totally out of control. ... We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.""Boeing had previous signaled it could cut the price of the presidential jets, if the government curbs its extensive security and communications requirements.Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson also met with Trump on Wednesday.Trump recently tweeted that Lockheed's F-35 ""program and cost is out of control"" and promised to save money on other contracts after he is sworn in.On Monday Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, defended the program by saying that out-of-control cost overruns were ""in the past"" and said the Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the next lots of F-35s with Lockheed and expects the cost for each of the three variants to fall 6%-7%.Trump also met with various generals and admirals Wednesday.On Monday, Boeing announced that it would cut 8% of its commercial plane division by year-end, up from prior forecasts, with more cuts on the way. That came a week after hiking its dividend by 30% and setting a $14 billion buyback.Boeing shares closed up 0.7% to 157.48 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares dipped 0.5% to 252.52.Trump's meeting with the major aerospace and defense contractors comes a week after Trump's tech summit with the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA) and many others.Meanwhile, Peter Navarro, an economist and China critic, will lead the National Trade Council, a new White House trade initiative under the upcoming Trump administration.RELATED:Boeing Expands Job Cuts After Big Dividend Hike, $14 Billion Buyback

354,MAR,"Since Nike last reported quarterly earnings, a few things have changed.America elected a new president, Adidas is back at the No. 2 spot in the U.S. athletic market and Nike's upcoming second-quarter earnings release will no longer prominently feature its highly watched ""futures"" orders, a metric that has been known to move share prices.Of those factors, the contentious election might be the least impactful on Nike so far. Shares have only slipped 0.6% since Nov. 8, though the stock has tumbled 19% this calendar year. Nike dipped 0.1% to close at 50.85 on the stock market today, dropping further below its 50-day line.""I don't think the election has impacted consumer demand, but many apparel retail stocks have traded down on concerns over possible changes to trade regulations,"" said Morningstar apparel retail analyst Bridget Weishaar (who does not cover Nike), when asked about the impact of the election on the broader retail environment.When Nike reports after the close Tuesday, per-share profit is expected to decline 4% to 43 cents on 5% revenue growth to $8.09 billion.Significantly, this will mark the first earnings release that does not share the company's futures orders, a Nike-made term that reflects products scheduled for delivery to retailers.As the company points shoppers to its app, website and stand-alone Nike stores, the metric is losing some relevance — at least, to Nike, which said in its last earnings call that its ""evolving business mix"" means that futures and revenue are less correlated now.Shifting the disclosure to the earnings call with management may alleviate some of the pressure around the quarterly figure, particularly following the last three quarters of missed forecasts.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering what happened last quarter? Nike beat on both the top and bottom lines but its stock took a hit when futures growth fell short of expectations. You can stop looking at that metric now, said Nike.Meanwhile, Adidas and Under Armour (UAA) remain pressing challengers.Nike ""faces potentially peak market share and operating margin in N. America as Adidas remains in a robust product cycle while Under Armour expands distribution and categories,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan in a Dec. 6 report, downgrading Nike to market perform from underperform.Its three-striped rival, Adidas, is back in the spotlight following a sluggish period in the U.S. that saw the athletic apparel maker ceding its second-place spot to Under Armour in 2014. The Germany-based maker of Superstar and Stan Smith shoes has since clawed its way back up, however.From NPD Retail Tracking service, Adidas has once again attained #2 spot in US sport footwear & apparel, passing UA. and behind Nike/Jordan— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) October 25, 2016Investors and analysts will also be looking for further signs of slowing in Nike's basketball business.But such concerns are ""overdone"" and ""shortsighted,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser on Monday, highlighting the company's brand and innovation pipeline. He has a positive rating on the stock.""The point is, NKE doesn't remain complacent for very long and the stock chart reflects this,"" said Poser. ""Historically, shares rallied 20%+ following other periods of investor angst (Mar-Sep 2002, Jan-Aug 2006, May-July 2012). We believe the recent pullback is a buying opportunity.""Also next week, mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect a loss of 18 cents a share, narrowing from a 49-cent loss a year earlier. Finish Line sells shoes from Nike, Under Armour and Adidas.After breaking out past a buy point on Dec. 8, Finish Line stock has fallen for six straight sessions.RELATED:Skechers Comeback Seen; Nike Loss To Under Armour, Adidas Could RampNike Seeks 'Energy Harvesting,' Augmented-Reality PatentsUnder Armour Clinches First Pro-Sports Deal; Nike Gets Nod From HSBC

Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!""What did the morning show do to incur the President's wrath?During recent shows, host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican member of Congress, called Trump ""the greatest liar that's ever sat in the White House."" He said: ""I mean, to compare (former President Richard) Nixon to this guy is absolutely ridiculous. He lies every day. A lot of times he lies every minute. He forgets the lie that he told five minutes ago."" He also said: ""Nobody's saying what Donald Trump's doing now is right. In fact we think it's extraordinarily dangerous. Called the media enemy of the people. It's Stalinist.""Trump, not amused, sent out the ""sexist"" tweet.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., among other Democratic leaders, denounced Trump's tweet as sexist, demeaning and divisive. Pelosi, in 2014, actually said, ""We never treated President Bush the way they treat President Obama."" Maligning Republicans as stupid, racist fascists is so common that Democrats have probably numbed themselves to it.About Ronald Reagan, Coretta Scott King said, ""I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party.""Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said Reagan was ""trying to replace the Bill of Rights with fascist precepts lifted verbatim from Mein Kampf.""Esquire magazine writer Harry Stein compared Reagan voters to the ""good Germans"" in ""Hitler's Germany.""Justin Kaplan, the editor of ""Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,"" said about Reagan (who was re-elected, 49 states to one), ""I'm not going to disguise the fact that I despise Ronald Reagan.""About President George Herbert Walker Bush, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said, ""I would like to ... say ... very clearly that I believe George (H.W.) Bush is a racist.""And, in 1994, when Republicans took control of the House, Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., said, ""It's not 'spic' or 'n-----' any more. (Instead Republicans) say 'let's cut taxes.'""About President George W. Bush, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, in July 2005, said, ""I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington,"" comparing President George W. Bush to Mad magazine's goofball icon.2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, on election night, said, ""I can't believe I'm losing to this idiot."" Earlier that year, when informed that Bush just had an accident on his bicycle, Kerry said, ""Did the training wheels come off?""Feminist attorney Gloria Allred, in 2001, referred to President-elect George W. Bush's possible appointments to his new administration, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, as ""Uncle Tom-types.""Unimpressed with the blacks Bush had in his Cabinet, entertainer/activist Harry Belafonte, in August 2005, said, ""Hitler had a lot of Jews high up in the hierarchy of the Third Reich.""Billionaire Democratic contributor George Soros, in November 2003, said: ""When I hear Bush say, 'You're either with us or against us,' it reminds me of the Germans. My experiences under Nazi and Soviet rule have sensitized me.""Al Gore, in October of 2005, said, to ""control and intimidate"" the news media, ""every day (President George W. Bush's executive branch) unleash squadrons of digital brownshirts to harass and hector any journalist who is critical of the President.""Democratic then-Senate candidate Claire McCaskill, in September 2006, said, ""George (W.) Bush let people die on rooftops in New Orleans because they were poor and because they were black.""Rep Barney Frank, D-Mass., in February 2006, accused George W. Bush of ""ethnic cleansing by inaction"" through his allegedly slow response to hurricane Katrina and its aftermath.Sen. Hillary Clinton, in January 2006, said before an audience of blacks, ""The House of Representatives has been run ... like a plantation — and you know what I'm talking about.""As for President Trump and the presidential race, time and space do not permit even an abbreviated list of the near-pathological attacks. Here are just two. A 2015 column in GQ magazine on Ben Carson, now a member of Trump's Cabinet, was literally entitled, ""F--- Ben Carson,"" using the actual four-letter expletive in the title. Howard Dean, former chair of the DNC, flat-out said, ""(Steve Bannon's) a Nazi,"" referring to the top Trump advisor.Let's remember that Bill Clinton, not Trump, tried to get Ted Kennedy to support Hillary in 2008 by saying, ""A few years ago, this guy (Obama) would have been getting us coffee."" Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., not Trump, said then-presidential candidate Obama could succeed because he was a ""light-skinned"" black ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.""Tell us again, who are the ""racists""?

Meanwhile, justices said the ban wouldn't affect citizens from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ""who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" such as family members or students enrolled in American schools.The last time the ban was enforced, it made significant impacts on international air bookings, even though it was in effect for only a few days.Between Jan. 28, when Trump signed the ban, and Feb. 4, when Homeland Security suspended the ban, international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5%, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys. Bookings rose in the middle of February, but the effect of the ban still lingered as overall February forward bookings for international arrivals were 0.4% slower vs. a year ago.Also during that period, some employees of tech firms were temporarily prevented from entering the U.S. and others were left wondering about their status, prompting companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft to denounce the order or express concern and support for their employees.Delta shares were down 0.1% in the stock market today.

A little more than 180 miles off Florida's coast, in the Bahamas, Chinese investors are involved in the four-hotel, $3.5 billion Baha Mar casino resort project, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June.Talks are underway this week to move the project forward after construction and money disputes. The general contractor is the China State Construction and Engineering Corporation, billed as the largest construction company in China, with some financing by the Export-Import Bank of China.Chang said she didn't know of any Chinese developers planning work in Cuba, but she linked the issue of future Cuba development to Miami's own development.""If Miami can continue its own investment to really build this great city to be a gateway city, not just the South Wall Street, I believe we have the opportunity to bring in more investors from Asia because then we'll have more direct flights from China, because more business will want to be here and more tourists too.""Chang, a Yale graduate, was in Miami to take an initial look at South Florida as her company surveys which American property developments to consider next. She addressed the National Association of Real Estate Editors' conference on June 26, five days before the U.S. announced the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba and its plans to reopen an embassy.Greenland's U.S. unit is a joint-venture partner with Forest City Enterprises (FCEA) in the big Pacific Park (formerly Atlantic Yards) mixed-use project in Brooklyn, N.Y. It has put nearly $5 billion into the project, which entails 16 residential towers plus commercial and retail space. Greenland USA is also working on the Metropolis in downtown Los Angeles — three residential towers, a hotel and retail — in which it has invested $1.4 billion.China's state-owned Greenland Group has more than $57 billion in assets worldwide, according to a Knight Frank report. In China, it is involved in building the world's third, fourth and seventh tallest buildings, among other projects.

416,MAR,"Covington, Ky., a city of 40,000 across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, seems like an odd place for a high-end hotel. For Mario Tricoci, that's a selling point.Last year, the Chicago developer hooked up with a local real estate investor on a $22 million retrofit of a century-old, seven-story, defunct Covington department store that locals say was the first skyscraper in Kentucky made of reinforced concrete.Tricoci, chief executive officer of Aparium Hotel Group, is in the middle of a small-market spree that started with the conversions of a Milwaukee warehouse in 2013 and a La Crosse, Wisc., chocolate factory in 2015. Aparium has hotels taking shape in a former warehouse for tractors and other farm equipment in Minneapolis, an old fire department headquarters in Detroit, and an obsolete bottling plant for Pabst Brewing in Kansas City, Mo. By the time he's done, Tricoci said, the company could be operating 20 hotels or more, with a focus on small cities that are nonetheless big enough to have a pro sports team.The idea is to grab hold of two dovetailing trends: consumers shying away from branded offerings and investors putting money into smaller U.S. cities, encouraged by local economic development types and a diverse set of national cheerleaders. They include AOL co-founder Steve Case, who has been banging the drum for technology startups in minor markets, and commercial real estate firms touting ""18-hour cities,"" on the theory that traditional markets such as New York and San Francisco have become too expensive.“Coming out of the recession, it felt like a safer environment to play in,” said Tricoci, 44, whose previous company built the Elysian Hotel in Chicago, a five-star offering that opened in 2009 and was later rebranded as a Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT)-owned Waldorf Astoria.While the room rates are cheaper -- Tricoci estimates that a $200 suite at his Charmant Hotel in La Crosse would go for $700 a night in New York -- the dearth of competition has helped keep Aparium's early properties busy.“Every one of these markets has wealthy people who eat and drink and spend money,” he said. “They have major businesses with spending accounts and stipends.”Aparium isn't the first hotel operator lured to the rehab business by the prospect of cheap buildings with good bones. The Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia sits in a domed Beaux Arts building that was put up as a bank headquarters. The Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel, a Marriott International (MAR) property, occupies a 1906 building commissioned by Henry Phipps, a partner in Carnegie Steel. Kimpton Hotels has a line, called Hotel Monaco, dedicated to the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. Drury Hotels has put beds in an old fur-trading building in St. Louis and a former education department building in Cleveland.The list goes on. Over the last decade, the boutique chain 21c Museum Hotels has refurbished historic buildings in Louisville, Ky.; Lexington, Ky.; Cincinnati and Durham, N.C., and is currently converting an Oklahoma City building whose original purpose was as an assembly plant for the Ford Model T. The company is working on historic projects in Nashville, Tenn.; Indianapolis, and Kansas City, where it will soon be competing with adaptive reuse projects flying the flags of Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.""More developers have started to leverage adaptive reuse over the past three years, and we've seen some really creative conversions across the U.S., often from vacant or underutilized office buildings to full-service, lifestyle and select-service hotels,"" said Lauro Ferroni, senior vice president at JLL’s[JLL] Hotels & Hospitality Group in the U.S. ""We expect this trend to continue, across both primary and secondary markets, as these are often the types of deals where developers make the best returns.""The trend toward adaptive reuse started in earnest when consumers began to tire of the cookie-cutter hotels popular in the 1980s and 1990s, said Jan Freitag, a senior vice president at the hotel data firm STR Global. There are more than 150,000 hotel rooms currently under construction in the U.S., up from a low of about 80,000 in 2009, just after the financial crisis. Using old buildings helps developers differentiate their products in a bustling market, and it may help hotels entice travelers increasingly lured to the more idiosyncratic experience of booking a room on Airbnb.Developers willing to meet the building standards of the National Park Service can qualify for Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which cover 20% of the rehab costs. Builders won preliminary approval for $6.6 billion of those tax credits in 2015, a total that covers residential and commercial projects. States commonly offer additional tax credits for historic rehabilitation.“These days there’s a demand for differentiation, where hotels want to be unique and have personalities,” said David Schon, a Washington-based partner at the law firm Nixon Peabody who advises clients seeking tax credits for fixing up old buildings. “When hotels want to locate downtown in centers of cities, they tend to be old buildings with interesting architecture.""For the Embassy Suites project in Kansas City, another Hilton property, a developer is planning to spend $149 million spiffing up a former Federal Reserve Bank building. There, you'll be able to relax in ornate splendor amid the ghosts of central bankers. Surely that has its charms, if not an infinity pool.Related:Affordable-Housing Crunch Moves Inland To Modest-Sized U.S. CitiesHot Housing Market Spreading To America’s HeartlandWhy Some Top U.S. Airports Are Getting Luxury Hotels

422,MAR,"One analyst poured cold water on expectations of a big premium for Twitter (TWTR) in a potential takeover. Disney (DIS) shares were downgraded, while a host of analysts updated their views of Marriott International (MAR) after its recent merger. Analysts supported Oshkosh (OSK) after the heavy truck manufacturer sold off on its earnings guidance.Oppenheimer downgraded the social media shares to underperform with a 17 target, after shares spiked on reports that Alphabet (GOOGL) property Google and Salesforce (CRM) were both in talks to buy the company.Analyst Jason Helfstein sees the likely buyer as a media company and doesn't expect an elevated valuation given slowing user growth and decreasing user engagement. He said he doesn't expect an Twitter buyer to pay ""meaningfully more"" than the 17 price target.Twitter shares reversed higher to close up 3.3% at 23.37 on the stock market today, on reports that Disney is weighing a possible bid for Twitter.Drexel Hamilton downgraded the media and entertainment conglomerate to hold from buy, cutting its price target to 102 from 112.

423,MAR,"No. 3 online travel agency Expedia (EXPE) is partnering with Washington-based Red Lion Hotels (RLH), but larger chains like Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) are still guarding their discounted rates.Expedia stock rose 0.3% to close at 112.25 on the stock market today, a day after it announced Red Lion would extend its discounted rates to Expedia customers. Red Lion stock fell 0.45% to6.83.The deal requires Expedia customers to sign up for Red Lion's rewards program and agree to receive Red Lion marketing emails. Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman calls the move a departure from Expedia's typical practice of withholding customer emails.The arrangement ""may be considered a major benefit by other hotels looking to boost loyalty program enrollment and direct email marketing lists,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report. ""Expedia noted it is in 'deep discussions' with 'a lot of other chains' about member rates.""But the Red Lion deal is technically a test and Expedia could decide to shutter the program. Red Lion is also a smaller chain and has typically supported online travel agencies (OTAs) as marketing partners.IBD'S TAKE: Expedia subsidiaries HomeAway and Trivago are each expected to reach $1 billion in sales next year. Meanwhile, Expedia says it's considering filing an initial public offering for Trivago.Larger chains like Hilton and Marriott have been steadily chipping away at discounts offered by Expedia, Priceline (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) by offering steeper discounts to customers who book directly with the hotel. This allows the hotel to avoid paying OTA fees.Kopelman estimates about half of Expedia's business stems from the hotel chains, while TripAdvisor and Priceline are 40% and 15% exposed, respectively. He reiterated his outperform rating and 135 price target on Expedia stock, which is down 10% in 2016.In related news, TripAdvisor announced Thursday it had acquired New York-based Citymaps, a social mapping platform that helps tourists ""uncover hidden gems and hot spots.""

424,MAR,"Hotel chains like Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) likely hurt No. 3 online travel agency Expedia (EXPE) during Q2, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman said Tuesday. But Wall Street consensus expectations are for double-digit sales growth.At the close on the stock market today, Expedia shares shaved off 3 cents to 117.64. The shares are down 5% this year, while IBD's 10-company Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is up 2%. The group ranks a low No. 117 out of 197 groups tracked.IBD'S TAKE: None of the 10 companies in the Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is rated very highly. No. 1 online travel agency Priceline leads the group with an IBD Composite Rating of 87, meaning it performs in the top 15% of all stocks in key metrics. Get Priceline's Stock Checkup.In June, hotel chains upped their assault on Priceline (PCLN), Expedia and TripAdvisor (TRIP), offering ""member rates"" that undercut online travel agencies by 2%-20% in an effort to avoid 10%-15% online travel agency (OTA) fees, Kopelman said in a research report. He models 18% organic room-night growth vs. last year.That would decelerate from 24% growth in Q1, which enjoyed Easter Weekend and Leap Day tailwinds, Kopelman wrote.Priceline is the No. 1 OTA by market valuation, with China's Ctrip (CTRP) No. 2.For Q2, the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models Expedia to post $2.25 billion in sales, up 35% year over year, and 78 cents earnings per share ex items, down 12%. But analysts project a return to EPS growth in Q3.That's vastly too high, according to marketing analysis firm Jumpshot. Based on historical bookings trends and Jumpshot's tracking of 160 billion user clicks monthly, the firm predicts Expedia's Q2 sales coming in at $1.9 billion, up 26%.
"
425,MAR,"Expedia (EXPE) subsidiaries HomeAway and Trivago will each reach $1 billion in sales next year, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman predicted Friday after the online travel agency's mixed Q2 earnings report late Thursday.But that will follow share loss to No. 1 rival Priceline (PCLN) and hotel chains like Marriott International (MAR) and Hilton Worldwide (HLT), he said. Euromonitor analysts said this week that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and TripAdvisor (TRIP) are pressuring online travel agencies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Expedia stock fell 2.2% to 116.65. Shares are down 6% for the year, as IBD's 10-company Leisure Booking-Travel has risen 3%. On Friday, the travel stocks were up, with Priceline climbing nearly 2% to 1350.81. TripAdvisor lost 1.8% to 69.97.IBD'S TAKE: Priceline tops IBD's 10-company Leisure Booking-Travel industry group, but the group itself is only ranked No. 106 out of 197 groups tracked. Priceline stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it performs in the top 10% of stocks in terms of key metrics.For Q2, Expedia reported $2.1 billion in sales and 83 cents earnings per share ex items, up 32% and 7%, respectively, vs. last year. Sales missed analysts' view for $2.25 billion, but EPS beat the 78 cent expectation.Adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $330.9 million, topping the consensus for $294.5 million, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a research report.HomeAway contributed $35 million to EBITDA, topping models by Kopelman and the consensus for $3 million and $17 million, respectively. HomeAway revenue accelerated 36% to $172 million on its new online booking commission fee model.But overall organic room night growth slowed to 12% year over year, from 24% in Q1. Kopelman noted headwinds including Orbitz's integration following its $1.3 billion acquisition last September, as well as share losses to Priceline and traditional hotels, and a weaker macroeconomy.Online travel has steadily improved since bottoming in 2009, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote in a report, but he says an uptick in terror attacks is likely to weight in the near term. Still, Expedia's international and domestic gross bookings increased a respective 16% and 31% in Q2.Expedia reiterated its full-year EBITDA model for 35%-45% growth. The company said the year will include greater contributions from HomeAway and Orbitz, which are already ahead of earlier guidance for $275 million to $325 million, Cowen's Kopelman said.That effectively lowered Expedia's core EBITDA expectations from 8%-13% growth, he wrote. And if room nights don't modestly accelerate in the second half of 2016, EBITDA will wrap the year close to the lower end of guidance.Kopelman lowered his 2016 EBITDA expectation to $1.635 billion, but he boosted his price target on Expedia stock to 135 from 130. He has an outperform rating on shares and in a research report highlighted bright spots like HomeAway's ""blowout quarter"" and a potential Trivago initial public offering.

426,MAR,"The pleasant surprise of the First 100 Days is over. The action was hectic, heated, often confused, but well within the bounds of normalcy. Policy (e.g., health care) was being hashed out, a Supreme Court nominee confirmed, foreign policy challenges (e.g., North Korea) addressed.Donald Trump's character — volatile, impulsive, often self-destructive — had not changed since the campaign. But it seemed as if the guardrails of our democracy — Congress, the courts, the states, the media, the Cabinet — were keeping things within bounds.Then came the last 10 days. The country is now caught in the internal maelstrom that is the mind of Donald Trump. We are in the realm of the id. Chaos reigns. No guardrails can hold.Normal activity disappears. North Korea's launch of an alarming new missile and a problematic visit from the president of Turkey (locus of our most complicated and tortured allied relationship) barely evoke notice. Nothing can escape the black hole of a three-part presidential meltdown.Result? Layers of falsehoods giving the impression of an elaborate cover-up — in the absence of a crime. At least Nixon was trying to quash a third-rate burglary and associated felonies. Here we don't even have a body, let alone a smoking gun. Trump insists there's no there there, but acts as if the there is everywhere.The Israelis, whose asset might have been jeopardized, are no doubt upset, but the notion that this will cause a great rupture to their (and others') intelligence relationship with the U.S. is nonsense. These kinds of things happen all the time. When the Obama administration spilled secrets of the anti-Iranian Stuxnet virus or blew the cover of a double agent in Yemen, there was none of the garment-rending that followed Trump's disclosure.Once again, however, the cover-up far exceeded the crime. Trump had three top officials come out and declare the disclosure story false. The next morning, Trump tweeted he was entirely within his rights to reveal what he revealed, thereby verifying the truth of the story. His national security adviser H.R. McMaster floundered his way through a news conference, trying to reconcile his initial denial with Trump's subsequent contradiction. It was a sorry sight.Republicans are beginning to panic. One sign is the notion now circulating that, perhaps to fend off ultimate impeachment, Trump be dumped by way of 25th Amendment.That's the post-Kennedy assassination measure that provides for removing an incapacitated president on the decision of the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet.This is the worst idea since Leno at 10 p.m. It perverts the very intent of the amendment. It was meant for a stroke, not stupidity; for Alzheimer's, not narcissism. Otherwise, what it authorizes is a coup — willful overthrow by the leader's own closest associates.I thought we had progressed beyond the Tudors and the Stuarts. Moreover, this would be seen by millions as an establishment usurpation to get rid of a disruptive outsider. It would be the most destabilizing event in American political history — the gratuitous overthrow of an essential constant in American politics, namely the fixedness of the presidential term (save for high crimes and misdemeanors).Trump's behavior is deeply disturbing but hardly surprising. His mercurial nature is not the product of a post-inaugural adder sting at Mar-a-Lago. It's been there all along. And the American electorate chose him nonetheless.What to do? Strengthen the guardrails. Redouble oversight of this errant president. Follow the facts, especially the Comey memos. And let the chips fall where they may.But no tricks, constitutional or otherwise.RELATED:Democrats Want To Impeach A Republican President?

431,MAR,"Forecasts for an improving economy and low gas prices should result in a busy summer for the U.S. tourism industry and a bullish outlook for companies that make money on free-spending vacationers.One of the likely beneficiaries is Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC). It develops, markets, sells and manages vacation ownership and related products — aka timeshares — under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands.Although Marriott Vacations Worldwide isn't as tied to macro factors as other travel-related stocks such as airlines, hotel operators and cruise lines, it still gets a lift when times are good.""The numbers in terms of people driving, as well as the forecasts for air travel, are back to pre-2008-09 levels. That bodes well for us,"" Chief Financial Officer John Geller told IBD. ""Going into the summer, we are optimistic and the trends are good.""Reflecting that optimism, Marriott Vacations Worldwide stock hit a record high of 89.85 on May 28 and is up about 18% this year.It is one of a number of stocks in IBD's Leisure-Services group to hit new highs in recent weeks. The group ranks No. 35 of 197 industries tracked and has moved steadily higher over the past six months.Other leaders in the group are a diverse mix that includes cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), sports and entertainment company Madison Square Garden (MSG) and fellow timeshare company Interval Leisure Group (IILG).The Price Of ParadiseMarriott Vacations, which was spun off from Marriott International (MAR) in November 2011, has 59 resorts worldwide. In coming quarters, it will open new resorts in San Diego, Miami Beach and Hawaii.The company competes with the vacation ownership divisions of hotel rivals such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) and Hyatt Hotels (H).Marriott Vacations Worldwide plays in the high end of the market. The company's average first-time buyer spends $30,000 to $35,000 for the ability to stay a week each year — perpetually — at a two-bedroom, two-bath vacation home in locations such as Orlando, Fla., and Hilton Head, S.C.That compares with an average sales price of about $20,000 industrywide, according to data from the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), a timeshare trade association.It sounds like a lot of money until you start doing the math, says ARDA CEO Howard Nusbaum.""It's not like real estate in the sense that you don't make money flipping it,"" he told IBD. ""Your value comes from your use of the property. If you spend $3,000 a year for vacations, in 10 years you spent $30,000.""With a timeshare, you might spend that much and get a lifetime's worth of vacations, Nusbaum says.About half of Marriott Vacation Worldwide's revenue comes from contract sales to customers. It gets about 20% from resort management and other income, including what comes from some ancillary businesses like food and beverage, spas and golf courses, in addition to management fees.Another 20% comes from renting out unsold units. The remaining 10% comes from providing financing to customers, most of whom can't get timeshare loans from traditional lenders.For most of its three-plus years as a standalone company, Marriott Vacation Worldwide's revenue growth has hovered in the single digits. That's primarily because it spent its early years focusing on operating efficiently rather than growing rapidly.""Coming out of the spin-off, our focus was really about improving margins and looking at how to operate as a standalone company,"" CFO Geller said. ""We were less concerned about driving top-line growth.""From Crisis To CruisingMeanwhile, the timeshare industry itself was still emerging from the beating that it took in 2008-09, when the recession and financial crisis made it all but impossible for many Americans to get timeshare loans.Normally, the industry isn't that vulnerable to economic swings. That's because travelers who own timeshares don't have to worry about coming up with money for a place to stay. But the downturn of 2008-09 was different because ""the financing dried up overnight,"" Nusbaum said. Industry revenue fell by nearly half.""Timeshare companies couldn't get loans, so they couldn't offer loans to customers,"" he said. ""We had 20 years of double-digit growth, but the 2008-09 downturn was very humbling.""With those problems behind the industry, it is now back to double-digit growth, he says.As for Marriott Vacations Worldwide, it has moved into a new phase where it can put more focus on top-line growth. During the first quarter, it posted a 13% year-over-year revenue increase — its biggest gain since going public.""In the first quarter, we started to ramp up our marketing efforts,"" Geller said. ""We shifted our focus more to first-time buyers.""First-time buyers account for only about 40% of the company's contract sales, he says. The rest comes from sales to existing owners looking to upgrade or add to their portfolios.""We want to get that to more of a 50/50 ratio,"" Geller said.In the first quarter, Marriott Vacations Worldwide posted total revenue of $454.9 million, up from $401.9 million a year earlier. Total company contract sales climbed 23% to $198.4 million, while earnings rose 52% to 85 cents a share, as calculated on a diluted basis, topping the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Renting 'Experiences' Pays OffMarriott Vacations Worldwide describes its points system, which members use to choose resorts and ""pay"" for stays, as a ""flexible 'vacation currency.'""And the company has added not only resorts but also things like cruises, guided tours and ""experiences"" that range from ski trips to golf excursions.""As we have been able to put our Destination Club in place — and it's really gotten a lot of traction — keep in mind that when our owners decide that they want to use their Vacation Club points for something other than staying in one of our resorts, whether they want to take a cruise or they want to take a tour or go to the Masters or whatever, they give us back those points for the year,"" CEO Steve Weisz said on the company's Q1 conference call in May. ""We turn around and take them into the open market, and we rent them. So that drives the revenue side of things.""If it all works right,"" Weisz said, ""we actually make a little bit in the arbitrage between what we rent it for and what we have to pay for the cost to fulfill the particular thing that they asked for, whether it be the cruise or the trip.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company's full-year EPS to rise 19% in 2015 and another 16% in 2016.""As the economy improves and wealth improves, demand for people going on vacation increases both in terms of the duration of their breaks, the number of breaks, and how much they're spending on different amenities like timeshares,"" MKM Partners analyst Christopher Agnew told IBD. ""That should be good for the industry.""

436,MAR,"If there's one thing Rick Simonson wants to make clear, it's that Sabre (SABR) is not a travel company.""Our customers are travel companies,"" Sabre's chief financial officer said in an interview with IBD. ""We're the technology provider to the travel industry.""Even so, Texas-based Sabre has been doing a lot of traveling lately -- to the cloud. Sabre's business in software-as-a-service (SaaS) and its work with airlines, hotels and other travel-oriented businesses is growing faster than the firm's mainstay travel network segment, which consists largely of its global distribution system.That system provides reams of information, such as prices and inventory -- most notably on airlines -- to travel agents, online agencies like Expedia (EXPE) and other travel buyers. Hotels are a smaller but growing portion of that, thanks in part to a deal struck last year with Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), its first large-scale hotel partner.""The (global distribution system) is a more mature market,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek told IBD, adding that it accounts for about 70% of Sabre's revenue.The other 30% of Sabre's revenue comes from its software platform, which it calls Airline and Hospitality Solutions. It provides reservation, inventory management and other software services to airlines and hotels. It's in its early stages but serves as a key growth engine, Wasiolek says.Whether old or new, however, Sabre's back-end technology essentially touches almost every step of a traveler's journey, from looking into and booking travel to boarding and checking in, whether with an airline or hotel. And on the operations side, its software helps airlines manage crews and tasks such as monitoring fuel levels, cargo weight and routing. For hotels, its software can manage bookings and come up with optimal room prices based on demand and other factors.Sabre expects its tech solutions business to top $1 billion in revenue this year, up more than 17% over last year. That compares with 5% to 6% growth expected in its core so-called travel network business, excluding revenue from last year's acquisition of Singapore-based Abacus International, a business-to-business e-commerce travel company focused on the Asia-Pacific market.Sabre bought the remaining 65% interest in Abacus it didn't already own. With Abacus included, management thinks travel-network revenue will grow 13.5% to 14.5% this year.""We will approach $3.5 billion in (total) revenue, which makes us one of the bigger software companies in the world,"" Simonson said, adding that margins and cash flow also are increasing. Revenue in 2015 rose 12.5% to $2.96 billion.After growing 17% in 2015, per-share earnings are seen increasing by 32% this year to $1.45 a share, according to a poll of analysts by Thomson Reuters.  Earnings are expected to grow 18% next year.""Sabre continues to evolve from a slower-growing travel distribution business to a technology-driven SaaS company, providing cloud-based solutions to travel suppliers,"" wrote analyst Mark Moerdler of Bernstein in a client note. He sees Sabre's SaaS business growing in the mid teens vs. single-digit growth for its global distribution system.Sabre is best known for its global distribution system, one of the two largest in the world along with chief rival Amadeus, based in Spain and big in Europe. A third, smaller player is U.K.-based Travelport Worldwide (TVPT). Many airlines use more than one global distribution system, and it's usually Amadeus and Sabre, and to a lesser extent Travelport.Airlines pay Sabre a modest flat fee for every air ticket booked, so traffic counts more than price. A portion of the fee is paid to a travel agency as an incentive for using its global distribution system.""The net fee we keep is our gross profit,"" Simonson said.Sabre is riding a growing air passenger market. Global air traffic grew 7.8% in the first two months of 2016 from a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association, or IATA. It was the strongest start to a year since 2008, IATA said.Simonson says that Sabre has more than 400 airline clients, covering most of the globe. Some of its newest airline customers include Italy's Alitalia, Air Berlin, Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) and Brazil's TAM Airlines (owned by LATAM Airlines (LFL)).Last year, Sabre completed what it says was the largest airline reservations system integration and upgrade in the airline industry, for client American Airlines (AAL), following its merger with U.S. Airways. The chief executive of American said the work was ""flawless,"" Simonson said.On the software solutions side of the business, Sabre gets a set fee for providing software and data for handling functions involved in getting passengers on board a plane. It also gets a fee for every person ""boarded"" in a hotel room, plus additional fees for providing other operational hotel services, such as digital marketing and property management.In Wyndham, Sabre landed what Simonson described as the ""largest hotelier in the world"" as a partner. The win last year was ""huge,"" he said. Sabre is currently rolling out a central reservation system across 7,600 Wyndham properties worldwide.Earlier, Sabre announced it would handle central reservations for the privately held Four Seasons Hotels.Most hotels, including big chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR), still handle such work in-house. Sabre's hotel business had previously focused on smaller, independent hotels around the world.The company's hospitality solutions business serves around 32,000 hotel properties, including hotels gained from its acquisition in January of Trust Group, a central reservation, revenue management and hotel marketing firm with a presence in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific.But it's the Wyndham win that's especially key to landing other large-scale hotels that may be inclined to follow suit and also outsource work to third-party experts such as Sabre, Simonson says.Analysts agree.""The (hospitality solutions) business has significant runway, and we expect the accelerated pace to sustain with Wyndham as an anchor client,"" wrote Ashish Sabadra in a recent report for Deutsche Bank Securities.

437,MAR,"Stocks scratched out thin gains early Monday, with some help from a passel of decent economic news and a bump up in oil prices.Dow stocks pulled up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq made a fractional gain.Volume swept lower, down more than 20% on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, compared with levels Thursday morning, when stocks last traded.The stock market today opened to generally healthy economic news, with Q4 GDP data reported when markets were closed Friday coming in better than expected, at a growth rate of 1.4%.The Labor Department reported early Monday that personal income rose 0.2% in February, down sharply from January's 0.5% gain but better than the 0.1% increase expected by economists' consensus. Spending inched up 0.1%, equal to January's downwardly revised number and in line with expectations. Price growth was steady, up 0.1%, although core prices -- minus energy and food -- slowed to a 0.1% increase, vs. 0.3% in January. Consensus projected a steeper 0.2% rise.Real estate sales were a positive, with pending home sales jumping 3.5% in February, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Economists had expected a 1.5% gain in February.Dow stocks were evenly divided and holding to gains and losses of less than 1% each.Marriott International (MAR) skipped up 4% to the head of the S&P 500. The bidding war between Marriott and China's Angbang Insurance to acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) amped up Monday. The consortium led by Angbang raised its latest bid to what Starwood estimated Saturday would total a combined current value of $88.66 per share. Starwood shares rose nearly 3% in early trade.Finish Line (FINL) broadjumped 9% after Jefferies raised the stock's price target to 24 from 22, while also maintaining the stock's buy rating.Noble Energy (NBL) dropped 7% in opening trade. Israel's supreme court ruled Sunday against allowing an offshore gas development deal by a joint venture between Noble and Israel-based Delek Group.

438,MAR,"Hotel chains such as Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) are chipping away at discounts offered by online travel agencies (OTAs) Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and TripAdvisor (TRIP), Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman said Tuesday.No. 1 OTA Priceline is least exposed, with only 10%-15% of its business stemming from the U.S., where the online donnybrook is mushrooming. Half of TripAdvisor's and 52% of Expedia's sales are tied to the U.S., he said.""These (hotel chain direct) discounts are in addition to loyalty program points and other offers/benefits being provided to customers only when they book direct with the hotel,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report.Direct discounts range between 2% and 20% cheaper than booking with OTAs, Kopelman wrote. He estimates 50% and 40% of Expedia and TripAdviser's sales are exposed to hotel chains. Only about 15% of Priceline is exposed.Importantly, he said, the direct-booking trend threatens to undo the reputations of OTAs like Priceline and Expedia which offer ""Best Price Guarantees"" that don't appear to cover the new ""member rates"" by hotel chains.""If the chains are successful in getting the message out that their own sites carry cheaper rates, they may be able to train customers to check the hotel website first before booking, decreasing OTA conversion rates,"" he wrote.But consumers largely aren't loyal to specific hotel chains, and most hotel chains have yet to buy in on the direct-booking game, Kopelman wrote. Plus, Expedia has a series of popular loyalty programs.On the stock market today, Priceline erased small losses to close up 0.6% at 1275.03. Expedia stock closed down 1.65% to 105.93. TripAdvisor stock dipped 0.5% to 64.30.Hilton shares lost 2.2% while Marriott fell 1%.

439,MAR,"China's Anbang Insurance Group late Thursday ended its bid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT), leaving Marriott International (MAR) as the likely winner of the long-running bidding war for Starwood.""We were attracted to the opportunity presented by Starwood because of its high-quality, leading global hotel brands, which met many of our acquisition criteria, including the ability to generate consistent, long-term returns over time, Anbang-led consortium said in a statement. ""However, due to various market considerations, the Consortium has determined not to proceed further. We thank the Starwood Board, management team and its advisors for their efforts and support throughout this process.""The Wall Street Journal initially reported Anbang's exit, quickly followed by other publications before the Chinese firm's confirmation.Starwood, which owns Sheraton, Westin and St. Regis hotel chains fell sharply in extended trading. So did Marriott.Starwood originally agreed to a $12.2 billion offer from Marriott in November. Anbang countered with an offer. On March 21, Marriott made a revised offer of $13.6 billion, consisting of $10 billion of Marriott stock and $3.6 billion cash.On Monday, Starwood's board issued a statement saying a revised proposal from a consortium consisting of Anbang, J.C. Flowers and Primavera Capital was reasonably likely to lead to a ""superior proposal,"" but noted that it had not officially dropped its support for the Marriott offer.Marriott on Monday reaffirmed its desire to acquire Starwood, saying in a statement that it was ""confident that the previously announced amended merger agreement is the best course for both companies.""Starwood stock has been consolidating for nearly eight months amid uneven earnings growth and nine straight quarters of shrinking revenue on a year-over-year basis. Its shares fell 4% in extended hours trading after closing down 0.3% in the stock market today.Marriott has been forming a cup-with-handle base with a 73.99 buy point. However, its stock fell 5% in late trading after closing down 0.5% at 71.18.

446,MAR,"Syria: President Trump sent a loud message to Syria's Bashar al-Assad for his use of deadly Sarin gas against his own people: Your days of terrorizing your own people with chemical weapons are about to end. But many others are getting Trump's message, too.""Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,"" Trump said, speaking from Mar-a-Lago in Florida. ""It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.""Two U.S. ships in the Mediterranean launched 59 Tomahawk missiles, striking Shayrat Airfield in western Syria, which U.S. intelligence believes has been used as a base for deadly chemical attacks against Assad's own people — including the 100 murdered this week in a Sarin gas attack.""Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked off the lives of men, women and children,"" Trump said Thursday, visibly moved, adding: ""No child of God should ever suffer such a horror.""So it's official: ""Leading from behind,"" as official U.S. foreign policy, is dead. ""Leading"" is back.Trump has clearly signaled that, after 8 years, the U.S. is ready to re-engage in the Mideast and elsewhere. This has been clear in recent weeks, as he's pointedly met with a handful of moderate and U.S.-friendly leaders in the Mideast to build a new coalition of sorts and to reassert U.S. leadership in the region.Just this week, he met with Egypt's Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and with Jordan's King Abdullah II, and he's recently talked with the Saudis and with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. He engaged Germany's Angela Merkel, Britain's Theresa May and Japan's Shinzo Abe. It's clear Trump's intent on re-establishing the damaged ties from President Obama's tenure.But equally clear, the strike by 59 Tomahawk missiles against the Syrian military base from which chemical weapon attacks were likely launched, was a broader message from Trump to other recipients:It's not our job to wargame what comes next, or play armchair general. We're not beating a drum for war, or for U.S. troops to be sent back to the Mideast.But Assad crossed a red line, one that poses a danger to all of civilization. The last time he did that, we did nothing. Now, a new president is showing Assad — and the rest of the world — that such murderous acts will have very serious consequences.And that's a very good thing for America and the world.RELATED: Can Trump Clean Up Obama's Mess In Syria?Cold War 2.0: Obama Doctrine Of Weakness Has Reawakened The Russian Bear Kerry's Syrian 'Cease-Fire' Is Really Just Capitulation

449,MAR,"J. Willard Marriott knew he didn't want to stake his future on the unpredictable livestock market. He saw enough of that from his father, who struggled financially in Marriott-Slaterville, Utah.So after graduating from the University of Utah, Willard struck out for Washington, D.C., in 1927 to set up an A&W; Root Beer franchise.He was ready for the business world. At age 13, he had farmed his own plot of land, earning $2,000 (worth $49,000 now) that season by planting produce that he determined the food markets needed.Two years later, in 1915, he rode a trainload of lambs to San Francisco to supply restaurants stocking up for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.Likewise, he knew the Washington area from his travels doing Mormon missionary work. So Willard and his new bride, Alice, drove in their Model T Ford confidently.With them was $1,500 that he'd earned from selling woolen goods to lumber camps on commission.A Start With Root BeerAfter landing in the nation's capital, Willard borrowed another $1,500 to open a root beer outlet on 14th Street. His new partner, Hugh Colton, also invested $3,000.The return was impressive. The first year, from 1927 to 1928, sales totaled $16,000 — worth $220,000 today — and Marriott soon bought out his partner.Marriott's A&W; root beer franchise was finding sweet profit in charging 5 cents for a frosty mug filled with root beer.From this humble beginning, Marriott built a global food service and hospitality enterprise by paying attention to details and providing quality at a reasonable price.The firm lives on as Marriott International (MAR), which had 2014 sales of $14 billion and has enjoyed a 550% stock ride since 2009.Marriott (1900-85) steadily expanded his operation. He shifted his A&W; stand into selling hot food and opened other D.C.-area outlets.Next came a name change. Alice came up with Hot Shoppe, devised menu items, decorated the restaurants and kept the company books.Marriott understood the risky nature of starting a new business, with 50% failing during the first five years of operation. He felt that pain with a Washington bank that closed paying only 20 cents on the dollar to its account holders.To avert such failure on the food front, he paid attention to every detail. He hired youngsters as traffic counters at key intersections around town in order to situate new restaurants properly.Marriott's big innovation was opening the first drive-in in Washington in the summer of 1928. To advertise the new restaurant, employees passed out tickets around town for free root beer. Customers came nonstop all day long.By the 1930s, the Marriott enterprise of eight restaurants stretched all the way to Baltimore.He was on a roll, even preparing meals for Eastern Air Transport. From this venture, his firm launched its in-flight catering service for all airlines serving the D.C. area in 1937.All the while, Marriott visited every operation of Hot Shoppes and made it a point to shake hands with employees while giving the kitchen and serving areas a white-glove inspection.He insisted on cleanliness, tasty food, reasonable prices and the complete standardization of the menu for each facility.He lived by the mantra ""if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers.""He instituted bonuses for managers and gifts for longevity of service. When employees had personal tragedies, he comforted them and aided them financially.""J.W. Marriott was a pioneer in employee advocacy,"" George Haley, director of the Center for International Industry Competitiveness and a University of New Haven marketing professor, told IBD. ""Only 41% percent of companies engage in it today.""With the birth of their two sons, J. Willard Jr. in 1932 and Richard in 1939, Alice stepped away from day-to-day operations but remained a force behind major corporate decisions.Meanwhile, the '30s were traumatic, as her husband was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes and was expected to live only a year or less. But Marriott lived 50 more years, worked to the hilt and saw his elder son take over the reins of the business he had founded.Hard Work""J. Willard built a solid and extremely profitable business by taking to heart that no person can get very far in this world on a 40-hour week, "" said executive coach Karissa Thacker in Wilmington, Del. ""He kept seizing new opportunities to expand and continually experimented with his operations to perfect them. His life is a testament to learning agility.""During World War II, Marriott contracted to provide meals to the Naval Communications Annex and industrial war facilities surrounding Washington. All of this activity fed company coffers that continued to grow well after the war ended in 1945. By 1952, revenue approached $20 million (worth $178 million now), generated from 58 outlets.The next year, Hot Shoppes went public at $10.25 per share. According to Lawrence Friedman's 2012 book, ""Go to Market Strategy,"" $1,000 invested in 1953 in the firm that would turn into Marriott International would be worth well over $1 million today.Then came 1957, a watershed year for Marriott. He opened his first hotel, the 365-room Twin Bridges in Arlington, Va.By then, his company had doubled its revenue over five years to $38 million (the equivalent of $320 million now). Ten years later came a name change to Marriott Inc.The company's leadership transition from Willard to Jr. — who went by Bill — started with the launching of that first hotel.In 1972, Bill rose to chief executive and helped transform the family business into a global empire.""Bill was one of the first to introduce revenue management to the hotel industry, employing analytical tools to predict consumer behavior,"" said Haley. ""He also recognized the segmented hotel market and developed brands for each price point.""Death And BeyondMarriott died age 84 at his summer home in New Hampshire. He is buried in Rockville, Md.Eight years after his death, the company split into two, Marriott International and Host Marriott, the second of which would change its name to Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) and become the nation's largest lodging real estate investment trust, with 2014 revenue of $5.4 billion.Bill relinquished the role of CEO of Marriott International to Arne Sorenson in 2011 and took on the title of executive chairman, helping oversee one of the world's largest lodging companies, with over 3,900 facilities consisting of almost 715,000 rooms in 79 countries.""I'm sure it was daunting to step into the shoes of J.W., a larger-than-life business figure, but Bill kept his father's corporate culture in place and chose his own areas to expand, being one of the first hotel executives to recognize the potential overseas,"" said Thacker.James Berkeley of London-based Ellice Consulting lauds the company that John Willard Marriott left behind for applying ""common sense more consistently and constantly than anyone else in the global lodging business. After first owning their hotels, they switched to franchising to minimize the competitive threat and improve the return on their capital. Their managers and employees are among the best in the industry and stem from their core values of taking care of its people, employing sound business practices, embracing change and pursuing excellence.""

"
471,MAR,"For all the outsized lore about its wealth, privacy, and byzantine social mores, Palm Beach, Fla., is an almost ridiculously thin strip of land, at times measuring barely 400 feet across.Mansions, most surrounded by hedges just high enough to indicate their colossal size, line up one next to another on the edge of the beach. Parts of the island are so narrow that it's only one-lot deep, which affords double-sided views of Lake Worth Lagoon and the Atlantic.Drive north along the barrier island's single road, though, and the land widens. And on this broader swath is Mar-a-Lago, the onetime residence of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and now a private club owned by President Donald Trump.In many ways Mar-a-Lago is the antithesis of the area's traditional WASP-y clubs — the Beach Club, the Bath and Tennis Club, the Sailfish Club. The Everglades Club — Palm Beach's oldest, founded in 1919 — is what Nicholas Golubov, research director for the Historical Society of Palm Beach, called a bastion of ""the old, Palm Beach elite.""Trump's business model in Palm Beach, by comparison, has been a beacon of inclusion. As long as potential members had the $100,000 entry fee (bumped up to $200,000 in January), there was a good chance that they'd be accepted. In a further departure from Palm Beach taste, Trump allowed nonmembers, as well as members, to rent spaces for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings and charity galas. Anyone can party at the new Winter White House, as long as they can afford it.""I think it's the best thing Trump did in his whole life,"" said Laurence Leamer, the author of the book ""Madness Under the Royal Palms: Love and Death Behind the Gates of Palm Beach."" ""He opened up this island. He also had Jews and gays and African-Americans — he even had the first gay wedding.""Mar-a-Lago has been a flash point between Trump and Palm Beach locals since he bought the estate in 1985, after the property had sat unoccupied for more than a decade. When Post died in 1973, she willed the estate to the U.S. government as a ""winter White House,"" but successive presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter never took her up on it. ""The Palm Beach beau monde is both baffling and uninteresting,"" wrote Martin Amis in a 1979 essay for Tatler, adding that the town is ""an enigma that you don't particularly want to solve.""Four years after the property was returned to the Post foundation in 1981, Trump negotiated a cut-rate price reported to be $8 million and moved in with his then-wife Ivana, an outsider amid an impenetrable wall of old-money elitism. ""(The community) didn't like brash Donald Trump at all,"" Leamer said.There were a series of lawsuits, threatened and real, in the 1990s between Trump and the town of Palm Beach. Claiming that he was being unfairly targeted because he represented an open-door policy in a closed-door town, Trump reportedly sent the Palm Beach town council copies of the movies ""A Gentleman's Agreement"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""In 2006, the town fined Trump $1,250 per day for an oversize flag on the club grounds; after a countersuit and a settlement, Trump agreed to donate $100,000 to charity, according to the Sun Sentinel. Even as he was running for president, Trump filed a lawsuit claiming that the Palm Beach airport's flight path over his estate was a form of harassment. (He later dropped the claim.)Most Palm Beach clubs have unapologetically restrictive membership policies, but resist any notion that those policies have anything to do with race, creed or color. ""That's an old-fashioned view, certainly of our club,"" said John Newman, general manager of the Sailfish Club. ""We have no discrimination in our club; members have to be sponsored by a current member, but we have all faiths in our club."" (The Bath and Tennis, Beach, and Everglades clubs declined to comment for this article; Mar-a-Lago did not respond to requests for comment.)Even beyond its semi-open-door policy, Trump went further in an effort to make Mar-a-Lago the most attractive club on the island. The Everglades might have a retractable roof and its signature coconut cake, and the Bath and Tennis might have spirited bridge games and an in-house hair salon. But Mar-a-Lago has buffets that are almost baroque in the number of options. Dinners are served on Post's original china, all presided over by a painting of Trump dressed in an approximation of tennis whites.Most of Mar-a-Lago is shielded behind a hedge, but as you drive around a bend on the two-lane South Ocean Boulevard (speed limit: 30 miles per hour), the property opens up, its rolling lawn sweeping from the massive, turreted Mediterranean mansion to its beach-side pool, which is ringed by yellow-and-white-striped umbrellas.Turn through the club's (relatively) unobtrusive white gate, flanked by decorative tiles, and visitors proceed up the palm-lined drive to the 110,000-square-foot home's ornate, quasi-Moorish, quasi-gothic stone entrance, which is adorned with an elaborate wrought-iron railing. Inside, the entryway has a series of stone crowns mounted on the walls, as well as a rather baronial, hand-painted, beamed ceiling.Dozens of similarly decorative rooms from the original home are available to members, including the ""Spanish room,"" with its gold-leaf ceiling, and the ""Dutch Room,"" which was made from the wood of a schooner and tiled in — you guessed it — blue and white Dutch tiles. A more recent edition is the club's massive ballroom, decorated in a Busby Berkeley version of Versailles, which can seat more than 800 guests.The overall effect isn't subtle, and that seems to sit fine with members, who reportedly include billionaire industrialist William I. Koch, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, and real estate titan Richard LeFrak. Whether or not members are similarly sanguine about the increased security, protesters and scrutiny brought by the president's repeated recent visits is less certain.Trump made his fourth visit to the estate as president this past weekend; Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, was also photographed at the club. Three weeks ago, Trump hosted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan there and created a kerfuffle as the two seemed to react, alongside fellow diners, to a ballistic missile test in North Korea. Trump has kept the club in the spotlight with the news he's building a helipad on its 17-acre property, indicating that he intends to continue to use the retreat frequently while in office.For some of the town's residents, Mar-a-Lago's — and Trump's — reputations are a deterrent. For others, it's the reason to go. ""I know people who refuse to go to Mar-a-Lago; they think it's the worst,"" said Leamer, the author. ""But to me, it's the most exciting club in Palm Beach, by a long shot.""

"
521,MAR,"Talk about star power. Strategic Hotels & Resorts owns some of the top trophy hotels and resorts in America, including the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, Four Seasons in Washington, D.C. and JW Marriott Essex House in Manhattan, to name a few.It's enjoying an upsurge in luxury hotel and resort demand as corporate travel and meetings pick up.That's a big shift: The Chicago-based real estate investment trust, or REIT, was practically on life support after the Great Recession slammed the lodging industry.Luxury resorts and hotels were especially hit hard. And Strategic's (BEE) high levels of debt and preferred equity made the sting even worse.""They were one of the worse-positioned companies of the hotel REITs into the downturn,"" said Wes Golladay, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.As profits plunged, Strategic shares fell in the stock market to 61 cents in March 2009. They had been as high as 24.35 in July 2007.Strategic embarked on a multiyear effort to reduce debt and generally improve its balance sheet through refinancing or restructuring properties' mortgage debt and raising equity. The plan also included select asset sales outside the U.S., most of them in Europe.""The big news is we've been quite busy over the last two years,"" CEO Raymond ""Rip"" Gellein told IBD.Exiting Europe to focus on the U.S. ""made the company more efficient,"" he said.Places Of NoteThe firm now owns 16 well-known properties in the U.S. A leased hotel in Hamburg, Germany, sublet to a third party, generates minimal revenue.In 2014, the company sold two of its hotels — in London and Mexico.Strategic has essentially completed most of its deleveraging process, Golladay says.Its shares rang out 2014 at 13.23, for a 40% gain in the stock market for the year, better than pennies but still far off its all-time high.""Now they can play more (offense), growing the business instead of reducing risk. And their hotel space has a good supply and demand imbalance: Demand is exceeding supply,"" Golladay said.Strategic went on the offensive somewhat last year, most recently in December, when it bought the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North for $140 million.Earlier in the year it bought out partners' interest in the Hotel del Coronado and the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess in Arizona.Gellein says the company intends to acquire more luxury properties, and will likely sell two ""non-core assets,"" the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort outside Chicago and Hyatt Regency La Jolla in San Diego.To diversify from its West Coast-heavy portfolio, Gellein says he's especially eyeing markets in the Eastern U.S., such as Boston, New York, Washington, D.C. and Miami.Not that the West Coast is a bad place for luxury hotels. To the contrary, there's limited new supply of luxury hotels and coastal land for building new hotels is scarce.Four hotels accounted for about 52% of the firm's hotel EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, RBC Capital says, in the 12 months through Q3. Three are on the California coast: Hotel del Coronado, Westin St. Francis and Ritz Carlton Laguna Niguel. The fourth: Fairmont Scottsdale Princess in Arizona.Strategic's hotels mostly are managed by major hotel brands such as Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and Marriott (MAR), among others. But as an asset manager, it works closely with hotel management teams on revenue-enhancing programs, such as retooling restaurants, adding spas and meeting space or renovating.Strategic spent $26 million in 2012-13 to reposition the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, adding a large ballroom and wellness spa.The firm also weighs in on food and labor costs. Labor at Strategic's hotels was cut during the downturn ""and we've been very focused that this (excess) overhead doesn't come back in the hotels themselves,"" Gellein said.Golladay notes that Strategic's hotel operating margins are more volatile than those of its full-service, high-end peers due to its higher fixed costs associated with nonroom revenue, such as in food and beverage, which take higher staffing levels.But food, drinks and spa services add considerably to total revenue generated per room. In the third quarter, Strategic's total revenue per available room, or total RevPAR, rose 7% year over year to $435.30 a day. Room RevPAR alone was $252.30 a day, up 6.4%.Total revenue in the quarter jumped 36.5% to $305.3 million. Funds from operations rose 64.3% to 23 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect FFO for 2014 to rise 58% from a year earlier to 68 cents per share, and go up 19% in 2015.SNL Financial expects the hotel sector to outperform other REIT sectors in 2015 in terms of FFO, with 16.6% median growth vs. 7.4% for all U.S. traded equity REITs.Strategic's closest rivals in the luxury hotel space are Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB), Sunstone Hotel Investors (SHO) and LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO), Gellein says.Unlike most lodging peers, who pay dividends between 2% and 4%, Strategic does not pay dividends to holders of common shares. Management says it intends to reinstate the dividend, but gave no date.For now, Strategic shareholders can take solace in relatively strong share-price gains, such as 2014's 40% jump.Outsized GainsLukas Hartwich, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, an independent real estate research firm, says Strategic's return, even without a dividend, has outpaced the overall lodging and resort industry over the last three years.Hotel REITs' total return in 2014 was 32%, according to SNL Financial. Total return includes share-price appreciation plus dividends. However, some hotel REITs outperformed the overall average — and Strategic's. Pebblebrook's total return, for example, was 51.9% in 2014, according to SNL.Meanwhile, Strategic's margins have been moving up. In the third quarter, the firm's EBITDA margin was 27%, up from 24.1% in the same quarter two years prior.""They've been decreasing their leverage while growing,"" Hartwich said.It hasn't been a smooth ride, however. Founder Laurence Geller resigned as CEO unexpectedly in November 2012. Reports surfaced in June 2013 that the company had put itself up for sale to appease activist shareholder Orange Capital.In a December 2013 letter to Strategic, Orange Capital charged Strategic with ""value-destroying governance practices,"" including ""problematic"" executive compensation, excessive corporate expenses and ""shareholder unfriendly corporate defenses.""Orange Capital was particularly upset over Strategic's ""non-marketed, exclusively negotiated sale process"" for its Four Seasons Punta Mita Resort in Mexico. It noted that Strategic had agreed to sell the hotel and adjacent land parcel to Cascade Investment, owner of 6.4% of Strategic's common stock. Orange saw that as currying favor before a shareholder vote for a new slate of directors.The $200 million Mexican deal closed in February 2014. Strategic maintained that it was a fair one.In March, the two parties reached an agreement. Strategic agreed to appoint an Orange Capital candidate to its board. Orange Capital withdrew three other board nominees. And it pointed out some positive measures taken by Strategic, including an independent review of executive compensation and redemption of the company's Series A Preferred Stock.Orange Capital has since sold its stake in Strategic. It ""moved on,"" as Golladay put it.As to the question of Strategic's potential sale, a company spokeswoman said this in an email: ""Strategic Hotels is focused on all opportunities that would enhance value for our shareholders and support our goal of continuing to deleverage the balance sheet and maximize the operations and value of our portfolio.""

561,MAR,"Shares of medical-device giant Medtronic (MDT) dipped sharply Tuesday after its fiscal Q3 sales missed estimates, though earnings and guidance were in line with expectations.Medtronic's earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 29 totaled $1.06 a share excluding one-time items, down 1% from the year-earlier quarter and matching the consensus number calculated by Thomson Reuters' survey of analysts. Sales jumped 61% to $6.93 billion, though adjusted for last year's buyout of Covidien, as well as foreign-exchange rates, sales increased just 6%. This was about $55 million below consensus.Medtronic affirmed its full-year guidance of $4.36 to $4.40 in EPS, which includes 45 to 50 cents of foreign-currency impact. It did not guide Q4 earnings but said sales should grow 5% to 5.5% excluding the foreign-currency impact, which it sees amounting to $180 million to $220 million.Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote that the sales miss was largely due to higher-than-expected foreign-exchange headwinds, but there were a few signs of trouble.""U.S. sales growth did slow a bit, coming in at 4% growth vs. our 6% projection and representing a deceleration from the 6% growth seen in (fiscal) Q2 2016 and the 14% growth seen in (fiscal) Q1 2016,"" Antalffy wrote. ""This slowing growth is likely in large part attributable to increasingly difficult comparables and, to us, doesn't yet suggest an alarming signal of a broad-based slowdown.""Medtronic did deliver positive operating leverage quarter-over-quarter, with EBIT margins of 27.8% vs. 27.4% last quarter, but this improvement fell below guidance of 28.0%-28.5% and our 28.5% estimate. This now leaves the increasingly positive operating leverage story very much back-end-loaded, with Medtronic having to deliver Q4 operating margins of at least 33.5% to hit its prior guidance for 29%-31% as reported for full-year 2016.""Antalffy also noted that Medtronic's competitors similarly missed sales estimates in the most recent quarter -- among them St. Jude Medical (STJ), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) -- making Medtronic's quarter look good in comparison.Medtronic stock was down almost 5% in late-morning trading on the stock market today, near 74. The stock had been relatively buoyant during the market sell-off, closing Monday just a few percentage points below the 52-week high hit last March.

564,MAR,"U.S. companies are still desirable, but less popular targets for those in an acquisitive mood as the first quarter comes to a close.Mergers in the U.S. are down 40% year-over-year, marking the nation's lowest total global share for the January-March time frame since 2012, despite the competing bids to buy Starwood Hotels (HOT), according to Dealogic.U.S. target mergers and acquisitions volume totaled $248.2 billion, a 40% reduction from the $415.4 billion last year. U.S. target M&A comprised 36% of total volume during the quarter.Overall, global M&A volume fell 25% compared with a year ago, slipping to $701.5 billion. The number of deals has fallen 19% to 8,347. It's a year of tough comparisons, as 2015's first quarter at $934.5 billion was the biggest for deal making since 2007's record high of $1.1 trillion.Mergers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell 19% to $217.9 billion, the least of the three major global regions that Dealogic tracks. EMEA-targeted M&A comprises 31% of the global total, its highest quarterly share since the second quarter of 2013. Asia-Pacific targeted mergers comprises 28% with $195.9 billion of the global total, on par with 2015's first quarter.Chinese companies are among those with the biggest appetites for deal making, with ChemChina's $48 billion bid to buy Syngenta (SYT) being the largest on record for the quarter. The Johnson Controls (JCI) bid to buy Tyco International (TYC) for $16.6 billion is the quarter's largest U.S. telecom deal. Overall, telecom deals fell 50% to $39.7 billion via 151 deals, its lowest first-quarter volume since 2012.Starwood Hotels (HOT) finds itself in the middle of a merger love triangle, of sorts, with China's Anbang Insurance's $14.7 billion bid competing with Marriott International's (MAR) $13.6 billion bid for its rival hotel chain. The dining and lodging sector had its biggest first quarter for mergers since 2006, with $25.6 billion via 198 announced deals, much of the total dollar amount boosted by the Starwood bid.Technology was the quarter's top sector with $100.3 billion spent on 2,115 deals, up 10% year over year -- and containing its highest first quarter since 2000's $190.8 billion. Real estate was the second-largest sector, with $69.5 billion on 440 deals, though that was down 22% compared with 2015.Health care mergers plunged 56% to $58.7 billion, its lowest volume in four years, though it's the victim of tough comparisons as the sector had back-to-back record-breaking years in 2014 and 2015.Oil and gas volume was $24.9 billion via 208 deals, down 41% year-over-year and its lowest volume since 2005 and its lowest first-quarter activity since 2003. TransCanada's (TRP) $13.2 billion purchase of Columbia Pipeline (CPGX) is the biggest Canadian outbound deal in the energy sector on record.Finance M&A total $58.4 billion via 470 deals, making up 8% of the global total, its highest Q1 share since 2012. In that sector, Deutsche Boerse's $14.3 billion deal to acquire London Stock Exchange Group is the largest securities and commodity exchange targeted M&A on record.Goldman Sachs (GS) led global M&A among banks who advised on deals with $214.2 billion, followed by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) with $153.1 billion and UBS (UBS) with $98.7 billion.In comparison, some of the megadeals during the first quarter of 2015 were the $46 billion merger of Kraft Heinz (KHC), AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics, and UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) $12.8 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran.
"
565,MAR,"It wasn’t so long ago that everyone knew Donald Trump couldn’t possibly be the Republican party’s nominee for president. Now that he may very well be the nominee, everyone knows he couldn’t possibly win in November.Indeed, everyone knows he’ll lose in a Goldwater-esque landslide, handing the White House and the Congress to the Democrats.But what if that’s wrong, too? What if he wins? Well, in that case, everyone knows he would be a disaster as president.I’m considering this from the standpoint of an investor. At first glance, it would seem that there are only bleak choices here for the U.S. economy.If Trump loses and costs the GOP control of Congress, we face at least two years of Democratic one-party rule like 2009-2010. Get ready for higher taxes, more federal regulations, single-payer national health care, union card-check, a ban on fracking and a Supreme Court stacked left for a generation.If Trump wins, get ready for protectionism and lots of it, and a raft of other loony ad hoc populist assaults on the economy.Sell everything? Maybe. But then again, maybe what everyone knows is wrong. After all, Trump must have something going for him, given his “yuge” success in the primaries so far.So maybe it’s time to have a little sympathy for the devil. You remember the iconic Rolling Stones song by that name. Its opening line is kind of like the Trump campaign -- “Please allow me to introduce myself, I’m a man of wealth and taste.” Okay, on the taste part, not so much.But Trump does introduce himself as a man of wealth, and that simple fact speaks volumes about what it would be like to have him as president.In the last election, Mitt Romney spent his entire campaign apologizing for his wealth, groveling to the Left’s narrative that branded him an avatar of white privilege. Romney lost because, in the end, he offered only the defeatist vision embodied in President Obama’s “you didn’t build that.”Trump couldn’t be more different. As a real estate developer, he did, literally, build that. And he’s proud of it, bragging “I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney.”It is often said that no candidate of either party is substantively engaging with the mission of re-igniting American economic growth. It’s true -- for almost two decades, all candidates of both parties have ritually conceded that America is in permanent economic decline and hid or apologized for whatever success they may have had personally.Trump is the first pro-growth candidate of the new millennium, and his policy platform begins with unapologetically offering himself as an aspirational example.Yes, obviously, in an important sense Trump appeals to the worst in people. But that’s hardly unique among politicians, especially the current crop. What is unique is that Trump is also appealing to the best in people. Trump’s seemingly jingoistic slogan “Make America Great Again” is a political inflection point as significant as Deng Xiaoping’s exhortation “To Get Rich is Glorious” was for China’s capitalist rebirth.The leftist economist John Maynard Keynes wasn’t right about much, but he was right when he laid out this enduring axiom of economics: “Our decisions to do something positive … can only be taken as the result of animal spirits -- a spontaneous urge to action.”For all the bluster and buffoonery, Trump’s campaign -- his very persona -- has the effect of letting it be OK for Americans to embrace their inner animal without fear that economic achievement will brand you as a greedy racist polluting imperialist.The bluster and the buffoonery are an integral part of his pro-growth program. Trump’s relentless -- sometimes tasteless -- assault against political correctness is an antidote against the guilt-trip that the Left uses to terrorize and suppress the animal spirits of capitalism.It’s not just atmospherics. Trump has put forth a tax plan as specific as that of any candidate. No less an authority than Reaganomics guru Arthur Laffer said: “It’s a great plan. And I think it’s better or pretty close to as good as Reagan’s.”Trump’s plan calls for a top personal tax rate of 25%, a capital gains rate of 20% and a top corporate rate of 15%. I don’t know of many pro-growth supply-siders who wouldn’t crawl across broken glass to get that enacted into law.To be sure, Trump’s plan has a protectionist edge to it. It calls for a one-time 10% wealth tax on corporate cash held overseas, whether or not it is repatriated. That’s bad news for American multinationals that keep cash overseas to fund operations there -- but then again, having the top corporate rate drop from 35% to 15% would likely ease their pain.Trump’s protectionist tendencies are the dark side of his economics. Happily, his opponents have been eager to point out his seeming hypocrisy here, noting that he hires foreign workers for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Such hypocrisy is a feature, not a bug. It’s encouraging that he admits shamelessly that employers must do such things, saying that “otherwise, you hurt your business.”Indeed, as the current Beltway joke goes, his two marriages to immigrants show that he understands there are some jobs Americans don’t want to do.If Trump faces Hillary Clinton in the general election, no doubt she’ll haul out the TV commercial that Lyndon Johnson used against Barry Goldwater in 1964, showing a little girl holding a daisy, consumed by a mushroom cloud. Trump is a madman, she will shout, at the same time as she rails against capitalism and Wall Street while denying her family’s own wealth.Meanwhile, Trump will run as a madman for capitalism. He just might win. And by unleashing America’s animal spirits, he just might turn out to be the most effective pro-growth president since Reagan.Luskin is chief investment officer of Trend Macrolytics LLC in Chicago, a strategic consultant to institutional investors.

568,MAR,"Though hotel stocks fell off in the last two weeks as the Ebola outbreak spread fear, hotels did well in the third quarter, outperforming the broader market on strong room revenue.The stocks in IBD's Leisure-Lodging group are collectively down 8% this month after rising 11% through the first three quarters of the year. A concern now is how Ebola might impact the fourth quarter's results.Revenue per available room ""was really strong,"" said Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak in a new industry update previewing hotel results for the third quarter.Citing estimates from Smith Travel, which now goes by STR Global, he said room revenue was up 8.7% to 9.4% in Q3. That's a step up from 8.2% growth in Q2.Top performing stocks in the quarter were Choice Hotels International (CHH), up 10.4%, followed by Marriott International (MAR) at 9.4%. Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) was up 7.8%.But that was the third quarter. One of the key questions for hotels in the fourth quarter is whether or how much the Ebola outbreak has impacted global and even domestic travel.Most major lodging companies have international exposure to varying degrees, ""and the headlines from the Ebola situation haven't helped,"" Yarmak noted.Marriott earlier this year acquired Protea Hospitality Group, the largest hotel company in Africa, with 116 hotels in seven countries in Africa. ""Has Ebola had any impact on the portfolio?"" Yarmak questioned, without providing an answer.Yarmak said U.S.-focused hotel companies such as Extended Stay America (STAY), La Quinta Holdings (LQ), Hyatt Hotels (H)and Choice should report some of the strongest room revenue growth in Q3 because of their ""heavy concentration in the U.S.""The U.S. economy has been performing better than other key global markets.Marriott ""will likely be at the upper end"" of its 5.5% to 7% guidance for Q3 room revenue, the analyst added.""Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) could underperform due to its international exposure and will likely fall in the lower end of its 5%-7% guidance,"" he said.Choice Hotels, he noted, ""had solid"" results in Q2, after it had underperformed in Q1. The company increased its 2014 revenue per room guidance to one of the highest growth rates in the sector.Marriott, said Yarmak, ""continued its outperformance (in Q3) with its consistent capital allocation message, increased growth in its pipeline and held a bullish investor day.""IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group is ranked No. 46 out of 197 industry groups. That's a drop from No. 21 a month ago.

582,MAR,"Rising business and leisure travel is sparking a strong recovery in the hotel industry as room demand outstrips increased supply, and investors are showing interest in hotel stocks.According to commercial real estate firm Marcus & Millichap, the U.S. hotel sector will reach new highs in occupied rooms and room revenue this year, with occupancy rates exceeding pre-recession levels.""The expanding economy and strengthening job market will spark additional spending by businesses and consumers, helping to fill more hotel rooms,"" Marcus & Millichap said in a quarterly research report this week.Hotel stocks have been faring well in this environment. IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, ranked No. 26 of 197 groups, has risen 12% vs. the S&P 500 index's 8% for the year to date. This month Marriott International (MAR) is up 3% and Hyatt Hotels (H) 2%. They and other major hotel operators Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Intercontinental Hotels (IHG) and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) are all up between 10% and 44% year-to-date.Marcus & Millichap's analysis of hotel industry demand predicated that the national occupancy rate would climb to 63.4% from 62.2% last year and that average daily rates would rise 4.5% to $115.31. Higher room rates and increased demand will lead revenue per room to grow 6.5% this year and overall revenue 7.5%, it said. In the first six months of the year, the nationwide average daily room rate rose 4.1%, slightly more than the rise a year ago. Revenue per average room jumped 7.5%, topping last year's 5.6% gain.The report noted that new brands and ""refreshes"" by hotels reflect the industry's ""courting of the millennials,"" those born between the 1980s to early 2000s. The huge new boom generation will likely account for nearly half of business-flight spending by 2020, the report added.Among the new brands and refreshes are Hilton's new Curio concept, consisting of independent hotels under the Hilton banner, and AC Hotels being introduced by Marriott in Miami, Chicago, New Orleans and New York, with more to come.Demand for hotel rooms was strongest in Denver, Nashville, Atlanta, San Diego and Dallas, according to Marcus & Millichap. Room demand in Denver jumped 10.7% in the first six month of 2014. A late recovering economy in Atlanta lifted room demand there.Among IBD's highest-ranked hotel stocks by Composite Rating are Wyndham, with a 97 out of a possible 99, Hyatt at 94, and then Marriott and Hilton at 93 and 92, respectively.

590,MAR,"Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has attacked China and warned about the dangers of deficient immigrant screening.""They’ve taken our jobs, they’ve taken our money, they’ve taken everything,"" he said of China in a speech late last month. He has called for a revamping, even a freezing, of the immigration system, but says he would make an exception for the highly-skilled.Yet no skills are required of the wealthy Chinese being courted by a Chinese-subtitled video to help finance a huge Trump-branded tower in New Jersey. The video leads viewers behind the wheel of a car into Jersey City with scenes of the tower, all to the tune of the theme song from ""The Sopranos,"" ""Woke Up This Morning.""The video was produced to help raise tens of millions of dollars through a controversial government program that offers expedited visas to foreign investors, overwhelmingly from China. While the program has many supporters who argue that it attracts foreign capital and creates jobs at no U.S. taxpayer cost, congressional overseers and Homeland Security have raised sharp concerns. Applicants are sometimes cleared in less than a month, and the critics say the government is essentially selling visas to wealthy foreigners with no proven skills, paving the way for money laundering and compromising national security.Trump Bay Street is a 50-story luxury rental apartment building being built by Kushner Companies, whose chief executive officer, Jared Kushner, is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka. It will have an outdoor pool, indoor golf simulator and sweeping views of Lower Manhattan; it adjoins an existing high-rise condo, Trump Plaza Residence. The firm that was hired to seek investors, US Immigration Fund, is run by Florida developer Nicholas Mastroianni, who announced a partnership last year with a Trump golf course in Jupiter, Florida.The visa program is known as EB-5. In exchange for investing at least $500,000 in a project promising to create jobs, foreigners receive a two-year visa with a good chance of obtaining permanent residency for them and their families. In 2014, the most recent year for which records are available, the U.S. issued 10,692 of these visas -- 85% to people from China.The Jersey City project has raised $50 million, about a quarter of its funding, from loans obtained through EB-5, according to a slide presentation by US Immigration Fund. Mark Giresi, general counsel of US Immigration Fund, said he believed nearly all of the EB-5 investors in the Trump project were from China.Asked for a comment for this article, a Trump spokeswoman said by email, ""This was a highly successful license deal, but he is not a partner in the financing of the development."" She did not respond to questions about EB-5. A Kushner spokeswoman said the project was entirely legal and creating jobs.The Government Accountability Office, the investigative branch of Congress, found last year in a general report about the EB-5 program that many applications contained a high risk of fraud, and discovered cases of counterfeit documentation. State Department officials told the GAO that there is “no reliable method to verify the source of the funds of petitioners.”Giresi of US Immigration Fund says his firm uses “very stringent compliance programs” with a “great amount of due diligence” to look into the background of prospective investors, including hiring private investigators.Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, last month cited a memo from Homeland Security saying that EB-5 visa holders do not clear the same hurdles as other immigrants, like proof of education and work qualifications. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said at the hearing that while he has supported EB-5 over the years, ""If the program is to continue, it must be reformed.""Last spring, a Homeland Security special agent testified that EB-5 applicants from China, Russia, Pakistan and Malaysia ""had been approved in as little as 16 days, with files lacking basic law enforcement queries."" And a report last year by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General found politically connected participants may have received favorable treatment, citing projects involving Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham.A spokesman for Gov. McAuliffe said the report demonstrates that he, “along with many other bipartisan individuals and businesses,"" asked Homeland Security ""to fulfill its obligation to adjudicate the applications that were before them in a timely fashion.”Rodham said in a phone interview that his interaction with Homeland Security was appropriate.The visa program was intended to create jobs in economically distressed areas but has often turned into a source of financing for high-profile developments in prosperous neighborhoods, such as Brooklyn’s Barclays Center and Manhattan’s Hudson Yards. Audrey Singer, a Brookings fellow, says data collected through the program makes it impossible to track how many jobs get created.Visas have become an issue in the Trump campaign although he hasn’t addressed the EB-5 program. He has acknowledged using temporary visas for workers at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. He says he wants to eliminate what he calls ""rampant, widespread"" abuse of temporary visas for skilled workers and is committed to ""institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program.""Trump himself has built few buildings in the past two decades. Instead, developers who want to use the name pay him a licensing fee. A Kushner spokeswoman, Risa Heller, declined to comment on the specific arrangement in Jersey City with Trump’s son-in-law. She said, ""The money was raised lawfully by the US Immigration Fund consistent with all the requirements of EB-5. This program enabled a development that created hundreds of new jobs in an area with employment needs.”Kushner Companies is a New Jersey-based real estate firm built by Kushner’s father Charles, a former rainmaker in New Jersey Democratic politics who pleaded guilty to a federal campaign finance violation, filing false tax returns as well as attempts to silence a witness. Charles was sentenced in 2005 to a prison term of two years. He remains active in the company. Jersey City is the first and, so far, only Trump project for the company.The Trump building, barely a five-minute train ride from Lower Manhattan, is located in Jersey City’s Powerhouse district, the site of numerous new high rises and other new construction and renovation. The pale yellow tower is expected to be completed this summer.Related:Chinese Buyers Home In On More U.S. Real EstateHow China’s `Smurfs’ Send Real Estate Soaring

591,MAR,"Hyatt (H) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT) both reported mixed fourth-quarter results just a day after Marriott International (MAR) missed revenue expectations.Chicago-based Hyatt earned an adjusted 21 cents a share, a 32% tumble and 3 cents below consensus estimates. Revenue grew almost 3% to $1.11 billion, a little above views for $1.1 billion.Comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) in owned and leased hotels rose 2.1%, ex currency. Systemwide RevPAR comps rose 0.9%.CEO Mark Hoplamazian said he expects ""another year of growth in 2016"" on RevPAR growth of about 3%-5%, minus currency impacts.Hyatt's board also OK'd the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million in shares.Separately, Starwood's Q4 earnings fell 8% to 89 cents a share, easily surpassing views for 79 cents. But revenue edged down 4% to $1.43 billion, slightly below estimates for $1.44 billion.RevPAR for same-store hotels rose 2.8% on a constant-currency basis worldwide and 4.7% in North America.Starwood sees full-year earnings of $2.74-$2.84 a share, well below the consensus of $3.27, and Q1 EPS of 56-59 cents vs. expectations of 71 cents.Hyatt shares closed up 2.9%. Starwood, which is being bought by Marriott, slumped 2.3%.The results come a day after Marriott also turned in mixed results, topping earnings estimates by a penny with a 13% rise to 77 cents a share but missing revenue projections for $3.72 billion on 4% growth to $3.7 billion.Shares of Marriott, whose brands include the Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance Hotels and Residence Inn, lost 2.6%.Marriott said in November that it would acquire Starwood for $12 billion, several months after Starwood said it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale.The companies announced Wednesday that they would hold separate stockholder meetings to approve the deal on March 28.Marriott and China's Eastern Crown Hotels announced Wednesday an exclusive development deal to introduce ""Fairfield by Marriott"" to mainland China, with plans for 140 hotels in five years.

593,MAR,"With hotels in 87 countries, Marriott International (MAR) is finding it harder to protect itself from currency swings, as exchange rates in the $5.3-trillion-a-day market defy expectations.The chain locked in its 2016 currency hedges about four months ago, anticipating the dollar would extend a three-year winning streak. Instead, the greenback has had a mixed performance, slumping against the euro and yen this year amid turmoil in global markets. That’s a problem because the cost of the hedges would be wasted if the dollar weakens.“For better or for worse, you are locking in,” said Leeny Oberg, Marriott’s chief financial officer, in a telephone interview from Bethesda, Md. The company set hedges in 2016 with anticipation that the U.S. currency will strengthen, but less than last year.The dollar’s gain in 2015 and surging volatility squeezed revenue for Marriott, McDonald’s (MCD) and other companies that sell goods or services overseas, triggering some headaches for finance executives. It made sense for corporate treasurers to hedge against the dollar’s rally in 2015, which was widely predicted by analysts.This year, the task is becoming trickier as currency forecasts, which corporate treasurers use as a guide of where to hedge, have been upended. Options prices imply that, since the start of December, when some treasurers would have been firming up 2016 hedges, the chances of the greenback strengthening beyond the median year-end forecast of $1.08 per euro have fallen to 37% from 48%. The likelihood of it reaching the median estimate of 121 yen has plunged to 19% from 49%.The dollar’s path hinges on whether the Federal Reserve can keep raising interest rates while its biggest peers expand stimulus and the specter of a global slowdown threatens to derail the tightening cycle.Hundreds of companies in North America and Europe blamed currencies for hurting earnings last year, according to Scottsdale, Ariz.-based FiREapps, which makes software to help businesses reduce the effect of currency swings. Foreign exchange shaved 9% from McDonald’s full-year earnings per share and chopped more than $17 billion from Wal-Mart Stores’ (WMT) sales last year.A surging dollar decreases the value of overseas sales when they’re translated into the U.S. currency for the purpose of reporting earnings. If the revenue is left in the foreign country and not actually exchanged into dollars, the decline is on paper only. The strong dollar also hurts U.S. companies by making imported goods cheaper while U.S. exports are more expensive in foreign markets.""Companies are getting hit big-time by foreign exchange,"" said Niklas Bergentoft, a New York-based director at Deloitte & Touche LLP, who co-authored a report on corporate hedging published this week. ""We see this continuing for 2016."" Deloitte surveyed 133 corporations with revenue ranging from $1 billion to more than $50 billion.For companies in the S&P 500 index, a 1% gain in the trade-weighted dollar lowers collective revenue by about 0.3 percentage point, said Stewart Warther, an equity strategist with BNP Paribas in New York. A Fed gauge of the trade-weighted dollar rallied 11% last year and 8% in 2014. The biggest risk is it keeps going for another year.“All our hedges expired for 2015, and you move into 2016, and there’s a reset for everyone back to the market,” said Tom Szlosek, chief financial officer of Honeywell International (HON).The maker of industrial goods ranging from aircraft engines to gas detectors locked in hedges for the euro at $1.10 this year, said Szlosek, whose treasury team reports to him monthly on currency movements. The euro rose 0.5% for the week to $1.0984 as of 6:41 a.m. New York time Friday.Last year, the company offset about 85% of its euro exposure at $1.24, limiting the hit from foreign exchange to 10 cents of full-year earnings per share, which was $6.04. This year, the lower hedge level means foreign-exchange effects may reduce annual earnings by as much as 15 cents a share, he said.For Marriott, dollar strength will probably reduce the fees it collects for managing hotels by $30 million this year because about a quarter of this year’s estimated $2.02 billion in fee revenue will come from outside the U.S., Oberg said.The company uses forward contracts to manage its exposure to the yen, euro, pound and Canadian dollar, because they’re the most actively traded currencies and cheapest to hedge. These contracts cover about one-third of foreign revenue from hotel management fees.Hedges in 2015 helped keep the decline from foreign exchange at $32 million of fee revenue, said Oberg, who declined to say at what level Marriott has hedged for 2016.“The currencies did move farther than I think people expected,” she said. “So, it was very helpful to have the hedges.”About 90% of companies use derivatives, including forwards and swaps, to offset their currency exposure, the Deloitte study showed. Most surveyed firms hedged an average of 68% of their cash flow for three months -- that hedge ratio dropped down to 59% of transactions for three to six months in the future, then fell to 50% for six months to a year ahead.McDonald’s said it expects the dollar to strengthen this year, but at a slower pace, knocking off about 20 cents from earnings per share in 2016 following a 50-cent hit last year. The company focuses its hedging on the euro, pound, Canadian and Australian dollars and yen, said Becca Hary, a spokeswoman. The hamburger chain only hedges for operations reasons and not for the accounting effect when translating foreign currencies to the dollar for earnings reports, she said.Wal-Mart’s decline in sales because of weaker foreign currencies last year was “by far” the largest ever for the retailer, David Cheesewright, chief of the company’s international operations, said on a Feb. 18 conference call. Wal-Mart expects the strong dollar to drive down sales by $12 billion this year.Companies that have manufacturing plants in foreign countries, such as Honeywell, can mitigate the fallout from currency fluctuations with “natural hedges” by keeping costs in the local money, Szlosek said. Honeywell, which has factories in countries such as Mexico and Hungary, says that including exports it generates about 55% of its $38.6 billion of revenue outside the U.S.“We have a big manufacturing base in those places; we try to source as much as we can locally and pay in local currency,” Szlosek said. “That is a nice offset.”

594,MAR,"Nearly 300 Americans applied for jobs at Donald Trump’s swanky Mar-a-Logo club in Palm Beach, Fla., since 2010. Trump hired 17.The rest of the jobs, and perhaps more, were filled by foreign workers that Trump brought into the country though the H2-B visa program, a temporary work visa program that lets companies bring in low-wage workers for seasonal jobs.According to an in-depth article in the New York Times, the resort applied for a total of 500 H2-B visas over those years. Assuming these immigrant workers filled the rest of the available jobs, that means Trump hired Americans for just 3.4% of the jobs available at Mar-a-Logo since 2010.A Reuters report from last summer found Trump’s various companies had “sought to import at least 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas since 2000.” One of the companies applied for temporary work visas for 250 fashion models.Trump told the Times that the only reason those Americans didn’t get jobs at the Palm Beach resort was because “they weren’t qualified, for some reason. There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area.”He went on to say that “Certain areas, in really successful areas, where we can’t get help, many people do that,"" meaning they import workers. ""That’s a good thing. Otherwise, you hurt your business.”From a free-market perspective, Trump is absolutely right to say this. Businesses should be free to hire whomever they want to get a job done, at prices they can afford, even if those workers have to be importedBut that’s not what Trump has been telling his audiences on the campaign trail over the past eight months.Instead, he routinely blasts businesses that import foreign workers for jobs that Americans can do, saying they are guilty of “job theft,” and he promises to punish companies that engage in such behavior.As Charles Cooke points out in National Review, “When Disney behaved like this, there was a loud and sustained outcry from ... well, no less than Donald Trump himself....Trump argued that Disney should be forced to rehire any Americans it had overlooked or replaced.”Surely, if Trump practiced what he’s now preaching, then he’d have done more to find out-of-work Americans willing to do these job before importing workers from places like Romania. Heck, he might have even offered to pay them more, and financed the higher wages by upping Mar-a-Lago's $100,000 membership initiation fee a little.Plus, it’s not as though the Palm Beach area was, or is, at full employment. In fact, the monthly unemployment rate in the metro area that includes Palm Beach has been above the national average 57% of the time since 2010, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.For a candidate beloved by his supporters for “telling it like it is,” Trump has some explaining to do.

595,MAR,"In what could be the first of many such moves in the hotel industry, Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) on Friday said it will spin off most of its real estate business into a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) and will also split off its timeshare business, Hilton Grand Vacations, into a separate, publicly traded company.The spin-offs are designed to increase shareholder value at Hilton, which owns brands such as Waldorf Astoria and Embassy Suites. The moves not only should increase Hilton’s combined market value, analysts say. They also would reduce the amount of capital Hilton has to pour into its non-hotel businesses.The upshot is that Hilton Worldwide can focus solely on managing its hotels business, hoping it will help it better compete against direct rivals such as Marriott International (MAR), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), as well as online travel sites like Priceline Group (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and Airbnb.“The transactions we announced today will result in three pure-play companies, enabling dedicated management teams to fully activate their respective businesses, taking advantage of both organic and inorganic growth opportunities as well as capital market and tax efficiencies,” Chief Executive Christopher Nassetta said in a prepared statement. “We intend to have the appropriate leadership, strategies and capital structures in place to set up all three companies for further success.”Hilton Worldwide’s newly formed real estate company will include around 70 properties and 35,000 rooms, the company said, while the timeshare business will manage nearly 50 club resorts in the U.S. and Europe. If the spin-offs pay off for Hilton, other hotel companies with a diverse range of assets, including Marriott and Starwood, might feel pressure to follow suit.Meanwhile, Hilton also reported fourth-quarter results on Friday. Adjusted earnings came in at 22 cents a share, up 22% from the prior year and in line with the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 1% to $2.86 billion, below views for $2.96 billion.Shares of Hilton closed up 2.5% on the stock market today. Marriott’s dipped 0.2%, while Starwood added 0.4% and Wyndham increased 1.3%.Shares of Priceline lost 0.7%, while Expedia stock gained 0.3%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

598,MAR,"IBM (IBM), American Express (AXP), Macy's (M) and 17 other companies have reportedly banded together to pool their information about employee health coverage and try to control employer-sponsored health-care costs.The Health Transformation Alliance, as the group is called, is starting with a project to cut prescription costs, said the Wall Street Journal. The alliance is expected to announce a 2017 launch for the project.A number of different areas could be put under the microscope, including health insurance providers, treatment outcomes and pharmacy-benefit managers.Marc Reed, Verizon Communication's (VZ) chief administrative officer, told the Journal that the goal is to make health care ""sustainable"" so that employers can continue providing it to their workers.He said the group could wind up becoming a cooperative that buys health-care services on behalf of their employees.

599,MAR,"For some Midwesterners, the presidential campaign brings the kind of New York values they can appreciate. Later this month, Manhattan hotel prices will arrive in downtown Des Moines, part of the financial windfall Iowa enjoys every four years as host of the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses.During the final week before the Feb. 1 caucuses, when thousands of reporters, campaign staff, volunteers, and others will flood the state's capital city, rooms that would normally rent for $200 or less have, in some cases, fetched $600 or more.""Every four years, this is the Super Bowl for Des Moines,"" said Andrew Hollen, director of operations at the downtown Marriott (MAR), a top hotel for both media and candidates that's sold out the week before the caucuses.The spending influx extends beyond hotel rooms and includes television ads, event production, office space, rental cars, restaurants and more.New Hampshire, which hosts the nation's first primary eight days after Iowa's caucuses, also gets an economic boost from presidential campaigns.That financial windfall is one of the reasons both states fight vigorously every four years to maintain their early slots on the political calendar.Years like this one, when there's no incumbent president running for re-election and both Democratic and Republican parties have competitive contests, are especially good for business. That hasn't happened since 2008.The Greater Des Moines Partnership — essentially the area's chamber of commerce — estimates that year's caucuses brought 2,500 members of the media and $25 million in visitor spending to the state's biggest metropolitan area.In 2012, when the caucuses were only competitive on the Republican side because incumbent President Barack Obama didn't face a serious challenge, the partnership estimates that the final week before the caucuses brought in 1,500 media representatives and $17 million in visitor spending, just to the Des Moines area.Touching Almost Every CornerIn smaller ways, the economic reach of the caucuses touches almost every corner of the state. Many of this year's Republican candidates are making it a point to visit all 99 of the state's counties, meaning their campaigns will spend at least something virtually everywhere.Tina Hoffman, the marketing and communications director for the Iowa Economic Development Authority, said she's never seen a comprehensive statewide study that spells out the caucus campaign's full economic impact.""There is no doubt that it has a huge economic impact for our state, in terms of hotel rooms, restaurants and television advertising,"" she said. ""It puts an international spotlight on our state, and it gives us an opportunity to talk about issues important to Iowa.""Using Federal Election Commission data in 2008 to track expenses directly paid to Iowa recipients, an Iowa State University economist found that the major presidential campaigns had a direct economic impact of $15.5 million in the six months that preceded the January 2008 caucuses.That was about 0.01% of the state's $130 billion gross domestic product in 2007, the report found. Still, for individual businesses the windfall can be significant.At the 801 Chophouse — arguably the top expense-account eatery in Des Moines — presidential election years are almost always tops for sales, said Damon Murphy, the restaurant's general manager. ""It's typically our best,"" he said. ""The last week is always super crazy.""Fewer ReportersWith fewer reporters traveling because media organizations are more closely watching expenses, Murphy says there's been less business than typical in the weeks leading up to the caucuses. ""It's a nice extra bonus,"" he said. ""But it's not as big as it was eight years ago.""Some of the biggest spending in the state lands in the coffers of its television stations, but those are mostly owned by conglomerates based outside Iowa.Federal Election Commission records are filled with spending — both small and large — by the presidential campaigns in Iowa.Hillary Clinton's campaign paid an Iowa-based company, Elite Productions Services, more than $234,000 during the second quarter of 2015 to produce staging, seating and sound for her events.Billionaire Donald Trump, the national Republican front-runner, paid $8,114 in June to rent Hoyt Sherman Place, a theater on the edge of downtown Des Moines, for his first appearance in the state as a declared presidential candidate.The campaign for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spent $200 for food and beverages at Alba, a trendy restaurant west of the state capitol in Des Moines.Supply And Demand At WorkThe final week before the caucuses is when competition for seats in restaurants and space in hotel rooms in downtown Des Moines will be especially intense. And it won't be just political junkies hogging those rooms.The Iowa Pork Congress, an industry convention and trade show, meets Jan. 27-28 at the downtown Iowa Events Center. The gathering typically draws about 5,000 participants from the Midwest and beyond.Supply and demand is hard at work: The Residence Inn in downtown Des Moines, located near occasionally noisy railroad tracks on the southern edge of downtown, is a Marriott-brand property that normally rents for less than $200 a night.The rate there soared earlier this month to as high as $619 for the final week of January, for those who didn't make earlier reservations. Later, prices dropped to $419.Guests do get free breakfast and Internet access.

600,MAR,"ObamaCare's impact on jobs is hotly debated by politicians and economists. Critics say the Affordable Care Act gives businesses an incentive to cut workers' hours below the 30-hour-per-week threshold at which the employer mandate to provide health insurance kicks in. White House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal, but BLS data show that the workweek in low-wage sectors sank to a record low in July — just before the Obama administration delayed enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015.In the interest of an informed debate, we've compiled a list of job actions with strong proof that ObamaCare's employer mandate is behind cuts to work hours or staffing levels. As of September 5th, our ObamaCare scorecard included 450 employers with more than 100 school districts among them. Recently, IBD explained that a big minimum wage hike alongside the employer mandate would add to pressure on employers to cut workers to part-time, complicating the goal of reducing inequality.Click on the employer names in the list below for links to supporting records, mostly news accounts or official documents.We'll continue to update the list, which we encourage you to share and download into a spreadsheet to sort and analyze.

604,MAR,"The record-high stock market and rebounding home values have made consumers feel more confident and comfortable about taking vacations, said Arthur Adler, Americas CEO and managing director of JLL's hospitality group. On the business side, the modest economic recovery coupled with slow job growth has necessitated more travel for workers, he added.
"
605,MAR,"More recently, group travelers have begun to book rooms with increasing frequency, which should give the industry a further boost, say Adler and Scott Smith, senior vice president in the Atlanta office of PKF Consulting USA, an advisory and real estate firm specializing in the hospitality industry.
"
606,MAR,"Fundamental Rebound
"
607,MAR,"The important group-bookings segment, which includes state organizations, business meeting groups and worker incentive travel programs, pulled back not only because of the slow recovery, but also as result of the negative reactions to the American International Group's (AIG) widely publicized retreat at a swanky resort soon after receiving bailout funds, Smith said.

"
620,MAR,"Developers all but shut down new construction as occupancy and daily rates plummeted amid the recession. Historically the supply of new rooms typically grew 2% a year, said Lauro Ferroni, vice president, research and strategic advisory with JLL's hospitality group. But construction has fallen well short of that over the last few years — it was less than 1% in 2013, for example, and this year supply is expected to grow by 1%, he said.
"
621,MAR,"For now, Smith thinks new supply will impact the market around 2018, which should translate into continued investment activity for the foreseeable future.
"
622,MAR,"""Who knows what's going to really happen in 2018 — or tomorrow?"" he asks. A drastic change in gas or airfare prices could affect hotel performance, he acknowledged, but the fact that room demand is outstripping supply has reduced investment risk when compared with previous cycles.

650,MAR,"A scuba diver swims above a reef dotted with colorful fish. An elderly couple ballroom dances on a beach at sunset. A woman sits on the edge of a rock, meditating at twilight.Then ""Diamond Resorts International (DRII): simplicity, choice, comfort,"" a voice says as the six-minute commercial on YouTube ends.Calling itself a provider of ""affordable luxury and priceless memories,"" Diamond offers vacations in 34 countries at 93 managed resorts, 154 affiliated resorts, 52 affiliated hotels and four cruise itineraries.The vacation packages are low-priced — such as five days and four nights in Cabo San Lucas for $292 or four days and three nights in Las Vegas for $92 — and are a marketing tool.The catch is that customers must be creditworthy, age 25 and older, earning at least $50,000 annually and ready to watch a one-and-a-half to two-hour sales pitch for joining Diamond's club. In the club, members buy points to use toward vacation packages.One of the costliest getaways, a nine-day European cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' (NCLH) Norwegian Star, costs 20,000 points at peak season. Among the cheapest, a one-week stay in an Ormond Beach, Fla., studio, runs 1,200 points in low season.Funding The FunDiamond plans to increase its sales force 5%-10% annually over the next few years and boost sales to Asian customers, CEO David Palmer told IBD. About 70% of customers finance their purchase at a 15% average annual interest rate. The rate varies by the down payment, which is typically 10%.Diamond bundles customers' loans into securities and resells them to insurance companies and other institutional investors, eliminating its risk in customer defaults. About 6% of customers default on their loans; about 3.5% default on maintenance fees, said Palmer.As a ""Silver Elite"" member, Lee Huffman of Anaheim Hills, Calif., pays a $2,400 annual maintenance fee and gets 15,000 points every year in perpetuity. The finance manager of a midsize bank in Southern California and his family have used the points to stay at Diamond Resorts in California, Cabo San Lucas, Paris and Sydney.""We prefer the comfort, convenience and cost savings of timeshares over hotels even more now that we have a child,"" said Huffman. He views his timeshare as an asset in his estate that he can pass on to his 3-year-old son.As of Jan. 1, 2014, points start at $7.66 each with a minimum purchase of 2,500 points, for $19,150, according to DiamondResorts.com. Members must also pay annual maintenance fees, which vary based on their membership levels, and incidental assessment fees for renovations or large repairs.Huffman and 524,000 fellow Diamond members can be credited for fueling the company's rapid sales and earnings growth. In its third quarter as a public company, the Las Vegas-based firm exceeded analysts' expectations. It beat earnings and sales forecasts on top of lifting full-year guidance when it reported first-quarter results May 1.Revenue grew 18% year over year to $181 million, eclipsing the $177 million consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) vaulted 37% from a year ago to $67 million, topping JPMorgan's forecasts of $51 million by 31%.Diamond raised its full-year 2014 EBITDA guidance to $265 million to $280 million, from previous guidance of $255 million to $265 million, partly because it managed to refinance a 12% loan at a much lower interest rate. It expects to save it about $22 million a year in interest.Performance Since IPODiamond stock has risen 40% from its $14 IPO price in July 2013.In a conference call with analysts, CEO Palmer said the company uses a ""capital-light model with minimal development capex required,"" which means that instead of building its own properties, Diamond adds inventory by buying out existing resorts. Diamond also collects fees from managing properties in homeowners associations.""Unlike its peers, with no significant plans to invest capital in new timeshare development, it sources inventory from recapturing vacation ownership interests from members who default on payment of their homeowners association dues and its bank of unsold points,"" JPMorgan analyst Joseph Gregg and colleagues wrote in a note May 1.Inside The IndustryAbout 30% of Diamond's earnings come from managing resorts, a task that's very profitable, says Gregg.""Diamond is in a position to generate appealing earnings growth, driven by what we view as sustainable operating momentum in vacation ownership and steady uplift in management fees,"" Gregg and colleagues noted. ""We forecast improving free cash-flow performance, given growth in its higher-margin management business.""Diamond is the 12th largest company by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, whose biggest components are Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Marriott International (MAR) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT). The group is ranked No. 79 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks.Vacation ownership can be a controversial line of business, however, and Diamond is no stranger to complaints.""In one year, fees rose by more than 40%. A similar figure the next year. Soon the maintenance fees exceeded the cost of staying in a Diamond Resorts apartment for a holiday through Expedia (EXPE), including airfares,"" a Gloucestershire, U.K.-based entrepreneur, who did not want his name published, said in an email. ""To add insult to injury, it became almost impossible to get a booking for any property except during off peak.""Diamond's management fees exceeded rental rates by 47% to 180% for various properties he saw online, he says, and when he refused to pay, he got calls every day — sometimes twice a day — and was told that he would be turned over to a collection agency. Diamond finally canceled his contract after he complained to every agency in the U.S. and U.K. that would listen, he says.""I just made a right royal nuisance of myself,"" he said in an email.Unwanted Diamond points can be had for pennies on the dollar on eBay (EBAY) and timeshare-resale websites. Only 3% of timeshares sell on the resale market, says Jeff Griffen, a senior executive at ResortBailout.com. The East Hartford, Conn.-based firm helps clients unload a timeshare for one to three years in annual maintenance fees plus closing costs.Walking away from a timeshare is like letting a house go into foreclosure, which could result in property liens, stained credit histories and even wage garnishment, according to Griffen. In addition, customers can finance their purchase only through Diamond, he says.Over the past three years, 525 complaints against Diamond were filed with the Better Business Bureau. Owners in Koloa, Hawaii, filed a class-action lawsuit over a $65,822,529 water-intrusion assessment, local media reported.Investing RisksSince owning a timeshare is a luxury that most people can do without, a global or U.S. economic slowdown could deplete demand for new purchases or hinder people's ability to repay their loans.""Currently, no effective secondary market exists to resell timeshare,"" Robert LaFleur and Whitney Stevenson, analysts at JMP Securities, wrote in a note May 2. ""If an effective and cost-efficient secondary market develops, Diamond's ability to sell vacation interests through its existing sales channels could be seriously impaired.""Among other risks, rising interest rates would increase borrowing costs for both Diamond and its customers, which could squeeze margins and dampen demand.Diamond will be increasingly more dependent on the securities market to get money and maintain growth in vacation-ownership sales, Gregg of JPMorgan says. Growth depends on its success in selling to new customers rather than existing customers.

702,MAR,"In fact, ISG has nixed creating a separate R&D team. ""Our partners and employees are our R&D product management group,"" Connors said. Most staff work at client sites, see their problems up close, and are dialed in to cracking problems.
"
703,MAR,"For example, one ISG employee evaluating a large manufacturer noted that the client spent millions on supplier contracts. But it didn't manage them efficiently. ISG developed a managed services system that led to $17 million in fees in 2012, including a $14 million contract with Marriot International (MAR). One of ISG's strengths is that its staff looks to cut costs and improve efficiencies.
"
704,MAR,"ISG also sponsors an annual ceremony where about 25 innovators are awarded a crystal trophy. Last year's ceremony was held in Barbados. ""It's about recognition, not rewards. We're trying to create memories,"" Connors said.
"
705,MAR,"An Idea With Legs
"
706,MAR,"An example of a prize-winning and innovative ISG employee is Debora Card, then a director and now a company partner based in Shelby Township, Mich. She recognized that ISG's relationship with clients terminated when its contract ended and wondered how to sustain the relationship.
"
707,MAR,"Card developed a ""concierge"" service, AccessISG, that kept a communications dialogue going by answering clients' specific IT and other questions online. ""The service gave our clients access to our data, experts, tools and modeling after the consulting project ended,"" she said.
"
708,MAR,"After first showing the idea to ISG's head of research in December 2011, she sent a one-page description to Connors. She described what the service required, how it would bring value to ISG, and the investment required to launch it. Connors embraced the idea.
"
709,MAR,"The executive committee gave it the green light. It went live in January 2012, one month after Card devised it. ""It didn't require new technology, a large amount of investment, and yet it was trying to do something different,"" she said of her innovation.
"
710,MAR,"The concierge service churned up fresh business with clients by providing ISG new insights into their problems. When a client asks a question, the query is also disseminated to the ISG team of relationship managers. ""It gives us insight into the problems our clients are facing. They're asking their most pressing questions,"" Card said.
"
711,MAR,"For example, one retail client asked about best practices for IT infrastructure services, covering data center and end-user computing because its consulting contract was ending. ISG's relationship manager offered additional services, which led to a new contract.
"
712,MAR,"""In the information technology marketplace, things don't stay the same for more than a few minutes,"" Card said. A consulting company must ""rapidly innovate or it won't stay relevant.""
"
713,MAR,"The key to innovation is putting in place ""a process for generating ideas and rigorously following through,"" said John Nottingham, a co-president of Nottingham Spirk, a Cleveland-based innovation firm. Staff is inspired when there's proof that ""employee ideas are meaningful for the company and aren't just going into a black hole,"" he said.
"
714,MAR,"But too often, staff focus on short-term fixes. To create the most enduring effect requires developing a group that ""is independent and not associated directly with the current (profit and loss column) to generate truly game-changing innovations,"" he said.At Information Services Group, all staffers go ""all in"" for innovation. CEO Michael Connors expects employees at every level to churn out new ideas in the company's core strengths of market intelligence, benchmarking, consulting and IT services. In the competitive environment of IT consulting, a company can either choose to innovate or fade away.Connors founded Stamford, Conn.-based ISG (III) in 2006. The tech insights, market intelligence and IT advisory firm's revenue has vaulted steadily higher, jumping from $132 million in 2010 to $184.4 million in 2011 and $192.6 million in 2012.Encouraging all staff to be involved in devising new solutions involves a structured approach, continuous encouragement from a hands-on CEO, and singling out gifted employees who develop novel business solutions.Innovation is playing a pivotal role in boosting ISG's revenue because ""the marketplace we operate in is in a constant state of change and flux,"" Connors said. ""We've had a series of innovations including client portals, research products and managed services that came up through our Big Ideas Conference and forums.""ISG's clients spend $50 million to $2 billion a year on IT services. But the firm doesn't take anything for granted in a fast-shifting IT landscape. It's pursuing breakthrough ways to keep track of emerging technologies, cloud computing and mobile apps, Connors says.As CEO, he sees his role as creating a culture where staff in 21 countries are free to express ideas. ""If they have an idea to drive new business and help solve client business problems, they can bubble it up,"" he said.ISG has seen revenue growth both domestically and internationally. In 2012, revenue spiked 21% in the Americas and 8% in Asia-Pacific despite a 10% decline in Europe. It's been expanding in countries such as India.Three Steps To InnovationInnovation is encouraged in three ways: 1. Through an annual retreat where attendees discuss the industry and look to devise new business services; 2. a ""Big Idea"" conference where teams explore new ways of viewing products and services; 3. a structured process where employees submit new ideas to the executive board for review.In fact, ISG has nixed creating a separate R&D team.

715,MAR,"MasterCard (MA) on Tuesday said it has entered seven new markets in Africa. The global payments technology company says it now operates in 48 of the economically surging continent's 55 markets.The seven new markets in Central and West Africa are Chad, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and Gambia.MasterCard also said it has expanded its acceptance network of ATMs and point-of-sale terminals across Africa to reach more than 58,000 ATM locations and 438,000 terminals.""Our investment in Africa, through sharing industry knowledge and best practice, and by providing training for our customer banks, merchants and retailers, means we are creating more opportunities for all stakeholders in the African payments sector and better integrating the continent's economies with those elsewhere in the world,"" MasterCard Middle East and Africa President Michael Miebach said in a statement.The International Monetary Fund forecasts that 11 of the world's fastest-growing economies through 2017 will be in Africa. Some 27 African nations have already reached middle-income status.Other U.S. global corporations active in Africa include hotelier Marriott (MAR), consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble (PG) and retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). European multinationals such as Nestle and Unilever (UN) also are beefing up their African operations.

Controversy erupted in 2007 when Blackwater personnel were involved in an incident in which 17 Iraqi civilians were shot.
"
732,MAR,"Prince, who sold Blackwater in 2010, will continue to oversee Frontier Services for DVN. Frontier owns 49% of Kijipwa Aviation, a Kenya-based aviation and logistics firm.

746,MAR,"Most interest is on the consumer side. Procter & Gamble (PG) is spending $450 million upgrading and building factories in Africa, including a $250 million baby care products plant in Nigeria. Wal-Mart (WMT) became one of the first big U.S. investors when it paid $2.4 billion in 2011 to buy South African retailer Massmart.

750,MAR,"Blackstone Group (BX)-owned Hilton Worldwide boosted the potential size of its IPO, which could gross as much as $2.7 billion, setting it up to be this year's second-biggest after Plains GP Holdings' (PAGP) $2.8 billion offering.Hilton and investors plan to sell 112.8 million shares for $18-$21 each, putting the high end of proceeds at about $2.37 billion. The sale of extra shares to meet higher demand could push the total to $2.7 billion. Hilton's prior view was for $1.25 billion.The IPO would also be the largest ever for a hotel, topping Hyatt Hotels' (H) $1.09 billion offering in November 2009.Hilton will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol HLT, becoming the latest in a string of debuts in a hot IPO market. Twitter's (TWTR) $1.8 billion IPO last month was the second-largest Internet IPO ever after Facebook (FB).Meanwhile, Chrysler said last week it plans to list on the NYSE under the ticker CGC. Fiat, which owns the majority of Chrysler, said it had to delay its debut until early 2014 due to tax issues.Hilton is the world's largest hotel chain with more than 4,000 properties globally, ahead of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT), Marriott International (MAR) and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).Blackstone, which bought Hilton for $26 billion in October 2007, doesn't plan to sell shares and would still hold a 76.2% stake valued at $14.6 billion — more than triple the $6.4 billion in equity and subsequent investments it made in the hotel.Hyatt shares eased fractionally in morning trading on the stock market today.

755,MAR,"Corporate fraud costs firms billions each year, mostly in losses from employee theft, according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. The impact goes beyond that. ""It's not just the monetary loss; it's reputational, too,"" Tim Hedley, who leads the Fraud Risk Management Services unit of accounting firm KPMG, told IBD.
"
756,MAR,"Companies can take steps to avoid misdeeds such as skimming cash receipts, usage of company funds for employees' personal use, inventory theft and manipulation of financial reports.
"
757,MAR,"• Spot the trend. After peaking in early 2009, the rate of reported scams declined for more than a year. But in this year's first quarter it rose again to levels not seen since mid-2009, according to the Quarterly Corporate Fraud Index, compiled by Atlanta-based risk and compliance consultant Network Inc. and New York-based risk consultant BDO Consulting. ""We've seen a resurgence of fraud,"" said Luis Ramos, the Network's CEO.
"
758,MAR,"More startling, the frequency of reported wrongdoing has more than doubled since 2005. That's partly because it is detected and reported more often. But Ramos says fraud activity is rising, too.
"
759,MAR,"• Start at the top. Leaders can create a culture in which employees know what's expected of them, Ramos says. Then workers will feel more invested in the company's success and push each other to do things the right way.
"
760,MAR,"• Make it clear. Your firm's code of conduct is the key to setting standards, says Hedley, who co-wrote ""Managing the Risk of Fraud and Misconduct."" Be sure employees understand it. Make it easy to read and not written in legalese. Translate it if you have foreign operations. Include practical advice. And, provide training.
"
761,MAR,"Ramos' firm works with a health care provider that sets goals regarding fraud and measures how fast it investigates an incident and resolves it. ""Their core concept is to bake integrity and ethics into their operating processes,"" he said.
"
762,MAR,"• Encourage watchdogs. Put systems in place so people can report wrongdoing. A hotline helps. Also include websites or special boxes for snail mail, Hedley says.
"
763,MAR,"Saying that most of the cases he has investigated were via employee tips, Hedley also noted the importance of prohibiting retaliation against a whistle-blower.
"
764,MAR,"• Take charge. Companies are getting more proactive in how they train employees regarding fraud, says Ramos. Firms must emphasize that workers need to report wrongdoing when they see it.
"
765,MAR,"""The quicker you find out about it, the less it costs you,"" he said.
"
766,MAR,"• Snoop around. Do detailed background checks on prospective employees. That includes credit reports and court records to make sure no trouble exists, said Hedley: ""You're better off not hiring the fraudster in the first place.""
"
767,MAR,"Also, don't forget to check long-time employees getting promoted to positions of authority.
"
768,MAR,"• Keep it a priority. Hotel operator Marriott International (MAR) builds integrity into everything it does, says Ramos, by training employees. ""They're fantastic at this,"" he said. ""They tell employees how they do business is as important as the business they do.""
"
769,MAR,"• Take action. All the planning and preventive steps don't mean you'll never experience fraud in-house. If it does happen, decide who will head the investigation, and make that person accountable, Hedley says. Decide whether to disclose the problem publicly. Once you're done, announce the results.
"
770,MAR,"""Who's going to report something if they don't think the company is going to do anything?""

Then workers will feel more invested in the company's success and push each other to do things the right way.• Make it clear. Your firm's code of conduct is the key to setting standards, says Hedley, who co-wrote ""Managing the Risk of Fraud and Misconduct."" Be sure employees understand it. Make it easy to read and not written in legalese. Translate it if you have foreign operations. Include practical advice. And, provide training.Ramos' firm works with a health care provider that sets goals regarding fraud and measures how fast it investigates an incident and resolves it. ""Their core concept is to bake integrity and ethics into their operating processes,"" he said.• Encourage watchdogs. Put systems in place so people can report wrongdoing. A hotline helps. Also include websites or special boxes for snail mail, Hedley says.Saying that most of the cases he has investigated were via employee tips, Hedley also noted the importance of prohibiting retaliation against a whistle-blower.• Take charge. Companies are getting more proactive in how they train employees regarding fraud, says Ramos. Firms must emphasize that workers need to report wrongdoing when they see it.""The quicker you find out about it, the less it costs you,"" he said.• Snoop around. Do detailed background checks on prospective employees. That includes credit reports and court records to make sure no trouble exists, said Hedley: ""You're better off not hiring the fraudster in the first place.""Also, don't forget to check long-time employees getting promoted to positions of authority.• Keep it a priority. Hotel operator Marriott International (MAR) builds integrity into everything it does, says Ramos, by training employees. ""They're fantastic at this,"" he said. ""They tell employees how they do business is as important as the business they do.""• Take action. All the planning and preventive steps don't mean you'll never experience fraud in-house. If it does happen, decide who will head the investigation, and make that person accountable, Hedley says. Decide whether to disclose the problem publicly. Once you're done, announce the results.""Who's going to report something if they don't think the company is going to do anything?"" Hedley said.

771,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) is riding high on Starwood acquisition, improving North-American business, strong RevPAR gains, sizeable international exposure, an attractive brand-position and positive earnings streak. In a year’s time, the stock has rallied 35.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 24.7%. However, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets and currency headwinds might persistently limit revenue growth. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystMarriott continues to impress investors with its solid bottom-line performance. In first-quarter 2018, the company’s adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.34, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 and increased 40% year over year. Notably, the bottom-line figure outpaced the consensus mark for the 15 straight quarters. Strong RevPAR gains and room growth drove the company’s results. Consequently, Marriott raised its 2018 earnings view. It anticipates earnings in the band of $5.43-$5.55 per share, up from the prior-guided range of $5.11-$5.34.Additionally, the company is persistently relying on acquisitions in order to expand its footprint globally. In 2016, it completed the acquisition of Starwood and became the world's largest hotel company. As a result, Marriott's distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East & Africa combined. According to the company, it has made great progress in integration of Starwood. Also, Marriott’s move to buy Starwood shows that the hospitality industry thrives on such blockbuster deals, which are critical to their success at a time when online booking is becoming important in the lodging business.Recently, Marriott announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company’s loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. Also, it is likely to enrich members with more than what was offered under the prior programs. Under this global loyalty program, members can book stays, and earn or redeem points across 29 brands covering 6,500 hotels in 127 countries and territories.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is very optimistic about growth opportunity in India. Recently, the Asian Development Bank forecasted that India will be the fastest growing economy in Asia. Marriott has more than 20,000 rooms in the country.  Hurdles to CrossMarriott faces various challenges related to the Starwood integration. If these integration efforts fail, it may not realize the anticipated synergies and benefits. Moreover, the diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business concerns, given the acquisition along with any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, might adversely affect its financial results. The integration process could also take longer than anticipated and involve unanticipated costs.Despite Marriott’s immense growth potential, a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on the Latin American region. In the Middle East, sanctions on Qatar have reduced travel into and out of that country. Meanwhile, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism in other Middle East markets.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (TACO  -  Free Report) and Denny's Corporation (DENN  -  Free Report). All these stocks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

773,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 and increased 40% year over year.  Total revenues came in at $5,006 million, which missed the consensus mark of $5,753 million but improved 2% from the year-ago quarter.Strong revenue per available room (RevPAR) gains and room growth drove the company’s results. Notably, with its owners and franchisees, Marriott opened approximately 15,000 rooms in the first quarter. In a year’s time, the company’s shares have surged 35%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 23.2%. RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter under review, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 3.6% in constant dollar (up 5.5% in actual dollars) driven by 1.4% growth in occupancy and 1.5% improvement in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came above management’s guided range of flat to up 2% on a constant-dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 2% in constant dollars (up 2.3% in actual dollars). Occupancy rate and ADR also increased 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.At constant dollar, international comparable system-wide RevPAR rose 7.5% (up 14.1% in actual dollars). Both occupancy rate and ADR rose 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively.Worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) in the reported quarter. The upswing can be attributed to higher RevPAR, robust cost controls, improved productivity and synergies from the Starwood acquisition.However, North American comparable company-operated house profit margins contracted 10 bps. Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 160 bps.Total expenses were up 3% year over year to $4,506 million mainly owing to higher general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses totaled $247 million, up 17% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $707 million, up 8% year over year.Second-Quarter 2018 OutlookFor the second quarter, the company anticipates comparable system-wide RevPAR to increase in the range of 3-4% (on a constant-dollar basis) in North America. This reflects the favorable impact of shift of the Easter holiday. Outside North America, Marriott expects the same to rise in the range of 5-6% and worldwide in the 3-4% band.Furthermore, gross fee revenues are projected between $935 million and $945 million, up 10-11% on a year-over-year basis. General, administrative, and other expenses are expected to be nearly $250 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $880-$890 million, up 7-9% year over year.Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of $1.34-$1.36.

774,MAR,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation’s  diversified product portfolio, strong loyalty program, strategic acquisitions and effective marketing efforts position the company for growth, whereas heightened competition remains a potential threat to the top line.The company recently reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same. Adjusted earnings of $1.33 per share increased 31.7% year over year including the benefit of the new income tax. Without such benefit, earnings grew 10% on the back of higher revenues in all the three operating segments, hurricane-related insurance recoveries and Wyndham’s share repurchase program, partly offset by higher interest expenses.Notably, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 4.65%. Over the past 30 days, the consensus estimate for earnings for the current year has moved up 0.8% to $7.33.However, considerable international presence makes the company vulnerable to various macro-economic conditions in many regions. Also, we note that shares of the company have gained 12.5% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 21.4%.Acquisitions to Strengthen Domestic and Global FootprintWyndham Hotel Group is constantly trying to expand globally through acquisitions. In January 2018, the company announced a definitive merger agreement with La Quinta Holdings Inc., a midscale hospitality company. This buyout is expected to help Wyndham significantly improve the hotel management business and strengthen its brand presence internationally.Moreover, in 2017, Wyndham’s Hotel Group completed the acquisition of AmericInn hotel brand and its management company, Three Rivers Hospitality. The acquisition has added 200 hotels across 21 states, predominately in the Midwestern U.S., Ohio Valley and Mountain states.Loyalty and Rewards Program to Boost OccupancyIn order to survive in a competitive industry, Wyndham is continuously devising new ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy. These efforts include emphasis on marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on-property amenities, travel perks and marketing partnerships. Notably, Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry.Currently, there are about 56 million members in Wyndham Rewards. In 2017, the company made Wyndham Rewards points redemption available to nearly 100 Wyndham Vacation Ownership properties, to generate new marketing opportunities between the two businesses. On completion of La Quinta’s acquisition, Wyndham plans to expand this program to 13 million members of the La Quinta Returns Loyalty Program.Increased Competition Remains a ConcernThe hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Wyndham is continuously facing intense competition from both large hotel chains like Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) and Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), and smaller independent local hospitality providers. Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms such as Airbnb and HomeAway. Unless Wyndham counters these competitions with appropriate strategies, these may pose concern to the company’s future profitability.Moreover, the hotelier has considerable international presence, making it vulnerable to the economic conditions in the region. Despite immense growth potential, a sluggish economy in Brazil, uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to keep revenues under pressure. Limited supply growth in certain Southern China markets, continued government austerity in Beijing and a drop in the number of visitors from Mainland China to Hong Kong owing to continued political disruption, are hurting China sales. Also, the company expects soft demand in the oil producing regions — that mainly include parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia — to continue hurting RevPAR.Wyndham carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

776,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) has been continuously focusing on unit growth as a major growth strategy. To this end, the company announced the opening of The Bernic Hotel New York City by Tapestry Collection. Marking the first Tapestry Collection property in New York City, the hotel is located in close proximity to the Grand Central Station and Rockefeller Center.Notably, in May 2018, Hilton had announced that two of its marketing leading brands — Curio Collection and Tapestry Collection — will boost its portfolio with seven hotels in the United States. Already having six hotels under Tapestry collection, the company further plans to enhance the portfolio of this brand by adding three more hotels.We observe that shares of Hilton have rallied 30.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.3%.Expansion to Drive Growth & Fend Off CompetitionThe move underscores Hilton’s absolute focus on aggressively expanding its brands in both the domestic and international markets. To maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuously driving unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, the company expanded its footprint across new countries for a total of 105 countries and territories. For 2018, it projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth.Hilton’s relentless expansion helps it in strategizing against growing competition in the industry. The company is continuously facing intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), and also from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report). Hilton, therefore, through its disciplined as well as strategic operations, and expansion is trying to navigate stiff competition.Enhancing Customer LoyaltyOpening of the Bernic seems to be part of Hilton’s efforts to enhance customer loyalty, more so because the brand is a component of Hilton Honors, one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 74 million members, this network emerged as a highly valuable asset for the company.  In 2017, Hilton added more than 11 million members to this program. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to boost the program. In fact, more than half of the occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Hilton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This reflects a year-over-year increase of 26.6% from the year-ago actual figure. In the last reported quarter, sales of $52.7 million improved 27% year over year and the upside trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well.As far as adjusted earnings are concerned, the consensus mark is pegged at 16 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 700%. The anticipated rise in the metric is likely to be driven by margin expansion, resulting from the company’s continuous focus on product and channel mix improvement, lower levels of discontinued merchandise, and stabilization of sourcing revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted earnings per share was 15 cents, up from a penny in the fourth quarter of 2016, thereby setting a positive trend.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

779,MAR,"Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13%. However, Melco Resorts’ bottom line surpassed the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 50.4%.Q1 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Melco Resorts will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 26 cents, higher than 24 cents in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In the fourth quarter of 2017, it witnessed earnings growth of 58.9% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $1,324 million, up 3.6% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayWe believe the Melco Resorts’ revenues in the first quarter are likely to be driven by mass and premium mass gaming revenues in Macau. Further, the company’s integrated resort offerings are expected to boost traffic and revenues.  Per Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (“DICJ”), gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose year over year in all the three months of the quarter. This, in turn, indicates that the casino hub is firmly on road to recovery. We thus expect Melco Resorts’ performance in the region to get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased focus on non-gaming segments like rooms as well as food and beverages are further expected to drive the quarter’s results.Furthermore, the Philippines gaming industry is being supported by the country's robust economic growth and its expanding inbound tourism strategy. City of Dreams, Manila, continues to deliver year-on-year growth across all gaming segments in the Philippines, Thus, Melco’s Entertainment City property therein is poised to largely benefit from this improvement.However, the company’s first-quarter results might be affected by stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ.Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Melco Resorts is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

780,MAR,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 3, before the opening bell.The company’s call transfer, Encore and linkage programs have substantially helped it in driving tours in 2017 and the trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter as well. Also, higher sales along with benefits from reduced loyalty fee and lower cost of Marriott Rewards points are expected to have driven earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.However, shares of the company have risen 8.6% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 25.3%.Let’s discuss how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up in the first quarter of 2018.Factors at PlayThe company’s distinguished marketing programs and continued surge in newest sales distribution have effectively aided sales in 2017. In 2017, the company’s total revenues increased 7.9% year over year and the northward trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well. Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $534.07 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.6%.Meanwhile, Marriott Vacations expects to directly benefit from reduced royalty fee, lower cost of Marriott Rewards points from Marriott and incremental co-marketing funds provided by Marriott’s credit card agreements. In 2017, the company’s net income rose 65.1% and the trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.50, suggesting 23% growth from the prior-year quarter.Despite high expenses associated with hotel operations, we believe that the company’s first-quarter earnings will grow on higher sales from various initiatives and cost savings resulting from joining Marriott on the reward program.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Suggest a BeatOur quantitative model predicts that Marriott Vacations does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Marriott Vacations has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marriott Vacations carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

781,MAR,"Ahead of the opening bell this Tuesday, we see a surprisingly high number of companies reporting Q1 (calendar) earnings both this morning and after the close this afternoon. True, most of the big names of the quarter have already brought forth their results, but companies like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) and especially Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) report after the bell today.Speaking of Disney, what had looked like a done deal regarding its annexing of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) film, TV and international assets is currently up for debate, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) reportedly gears up to sweeten the pot with its own offer for the creative businesses. The original Disney-Fox deal was for $52 billion; Comcast is looking to secure as much as $60 billion — all cash — to swoop in for those assets itself.Comcast was already in the mix somewhat, beforehand: it had put in a bid to buy British communications company Sky Broadcasting, or at least the 2/3 of the company Fox doesn’t already currently own. But one important component to all this is whether the proposed AT&T (T  -  Free Report)-Time Warner  merger passes regulatory appeal; while it does not appear to subvert any merger precedents, plenty of resistance for this deal — not least of all from the White House — have clouded this path for months.Time, as they say, will tell. The morning prior to Disney’s fiscal Q2 earnings report, the Zacks consensus expects $1.68 per share on $14.23 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 12% on the bottom line and 6.7% on the top. Disney has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of the last 4 quarters for a modest trailing 4-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.7%. For more on DIS’s earnings, click here.Before Tuesday’s open, Dean Foods (DF  -  Free Report) put up beats on both top and bottom lines for its Q1 earnings report, posting 14 cents per share that beat consensus by 2 cents (a penny higher year over year) on sales of $1.98 billion that outpaced the $1.84 billion analysts were expecting. This is only the second earnings beat for Dean in the past 4 quarters; ahead of its report, the company carried a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), but had a Zacks Style Score (Value-Growth-Momentum) of A. For more on DF’s earnings, click here.

783,MAR,"Stocks opened higher on Monday ahead of what is sure to be another busy week for investors, as they assess some major economic indicators. Furthermore, with many more big-names set to report their quarterly earnings this week, it’s time to take a look at a few stocks investors might want to buy.Investors have started to react to news that capital spending seems to be booming. Credit Suisse estimated that the amount of money companies spent on big-ticket items surge 20% in the first quarter, which would mark the biggest quarterly growth rate since 2011. Some of the biggest spenders so far include tech giants Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).Moving on, titans from Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) to Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) are set to report their quarterly earnings results this week. With that said, investors need to hunt for companies that are set to report better-than-expected quarterly earnings results while market uncertainty remains.    Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these strong stocks ahead of their upcoming Q1 earnings reports. Check them out now:1.     Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report)Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev have sunk over 18% in the last year and 11.5% during the last four weeks alone as the company struggles to adjust to shifting consumer habits. But one strong quarter could help this international beer powerhouse turn things around. Unfortunately, BUD is expected to see its quarterly revenues sink 0.72% from the year-ago period to $12.83 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, investors should be happy to note that the company’s earnings are projected pop by 6.8% to reach $0.79 per share. Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share, which is 3 cents better than our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 4.46%. This means BUD is a stock that could top quarterly estimates when it reports its Q1 earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday.2.       Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report)Marriott has seen its stock price soar 40% over the last year, while also escaping the nearly market-wide decline over the last three months. Looking ahead, the hotel giant’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by 3.5% to $5.75 billion. Investors will be even more pleased to note that Marriott’s Q1 earnings are expected to surge by nearly 24% to hit $1.25 per share. Marriott is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of 0.40%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, investors can consider MAR a stock that could top earnings estimates when it reports its first quarter financial results after market close on Tuesday.3.       Roku (ROKU  -  Free Report)Shares of Roku had surged over 7% through morning trading on Monday in a sign that investors might be expecting massive results from the streaming video platform. However, before today’s climb, Roku stock had plummeted nearly 28% over the last 12 weeks. The newly public company is expected to report quarterly revenues of $128.41 million after market close on Wednesday.However, Roku, like many other young tech companies, is projected to post an adjusted quarterly loss for at least the next couple of years. In the first quarter, Roku is expected to report an adjusted quarterly loss of $0.16 per share. Still, Roku is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rocks an Earnings ESP of 14.56%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 2 cents better than our current consensus estimate. This, of course, means that Roku is poised to top quarterly earnings estimates, and might be a stock to consider buying.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

More than 850 companies, including 46 S&P 500 members, will report earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 78% surpassed earnings estimates while 75.6% beat revenue estimates and 63.3% outpaced both the counts. Further, total earnings of these companies increased 24% from a year ago on 9.3% higher revenues.The report projects an 23.2% year-over-year rise in total earnings for S&P 500 companies, with revenues likely to increase 8.7%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year increase of 13.4% for earnings and 8.1% for revenues in the last reported quarter.Consumer Discretionary Sector on Growth PathThe widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to put up a decent show in Q1 earnings.Currently, the domestic economy is favorable for the consumer discretionary sector on increased demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in improved purchasing behavior. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending in three years.Total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 13.2% in the first quarter, compared with 0.8% in the last reported quarter. Revenues are expected to grow 6.9%, higher than 4.6% in the preceding quarter. Margins are also expected to improve 0.7%, comparing favorably with the 0.4% decline seen in the fourth quarter of 2017.U.S. Hotels Seem ComfortingThere are ample reasons why the U.S. hotel industry, within Consumer Discretionary, should continue to gain on both the top and the bottom line. A strong economy, higher income and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel. The supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010, with growth in demand outpacing supply growth. STR/Tourism Economics expects demand (2.3% rise) to outpace supply (increase of 2%) in 2018. Moreover, per a report by Deloitte, the hotel industry is expected to sustain strong 5-6% growth throughout 2018.The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has rallied 24.6% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500’s 11% growth.Hotel bigwig Marriott International, Inc.

Shares of the company have lost 11.8% in the past year.A Mixed Bag for Leisure and Recreation ServicesAlthough the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, within Consumer Discretionary, has lost 0.2% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500’s growth, increased consumer spending on leisure stocks is expected to have favored the industry in the first quarter.Planet Fitness, Inc.

The company’s shares have gained a whopping 93.3% in the past year outperforming both the S&P 500 market and the industry.The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 27 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 42.1%. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $114.44 million, reflecting a rise of 25.6% from a year ago.

785,MAR,"The prevailing dispute between the United States and China Trade threaten to wreak most markets that are sensitive to business cycle fluctuations. The hospitality industry therefore might not be able to survive the effects of a trade clash. The hotel space, which largely depends on consumer discretionary spending, is constantly apprehensive about a trade war dampening consumer confidence.It is also to be noted that President Trump’s stringent policies have made United States a somewhat less popular tourist destination. Per the UN World Tourism Organization, United States reported a 2% decline in foreign tourist count in 2017.However, there are a few factors backing hotel stocks amid the turmoil. Let’s take a look.Why Trade Disputes Might Not be as HarrowingPer the U.S. Travel Association, a large part of employment in the United States is directly reliant on tourism. Travel industry added 3,900 jobs in March after the robust 8,400 addition in February..Moreover, per the official data, Chinese tourism accounted for $33 billion spending in the United States in 2016. Further, U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office forecasts tourist count to reach 4.5 million by 2022.  China’s outbound tourism is currently growing around 6% per year, with predictions of more than 200 million Chinese traveling overseas by 2022.Although a brewing trade war might deal a blow to United States’ tourist numbers from China, it wouldn’t be very severe as the major beneficiaries of Chinese tourism in America are democratic states such as California, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York.Also, a rivalry that can affect tourism and hospitality industry goes against China’s business interest. This is because a number of its tour agencies, tour companies and airlines have huge holdings in the United States. Even U.S. tour operators are linked with large hoteliers who have significant hold in China.Given this scenario, the countries might not want to put their tourism industry at stake by waging a trade war.US Hotels to Sustain Modest GrowthDespite the challenges, we see no reason why the U.S. hotel industry should not continue to gain on both the top and the bottom line. The domestic economy, currently, is favorable for hospitality companies. The overall economy shows increased consumer demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Unemployment is predicted at 3.8% for 2018 versus the current 4.1%. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in the higher purchasing behavior. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending after three years.Moreover, a strong economy, higher income and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel. The supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010, with growth in demand outpacing supply growth.Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year, which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U.S. lodging industry, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects demand (2.1% rise) to outpace supply (increase of 1.9%) in 2018. Moreover, per a report by Deloitte, the hotel industry is estimated to sustain a strong 5% to 6% growth throughout 2018.Also, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has rallied 32% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s 14.7%.Initiatives Adopted by Bigwigs EncourageIn order to capitalize on the growing demand for hotels and leisure, top hoteliers like Marriot International (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) are continuously opting for ways to provide highest consumer satisfaction. By moving toward launching more lifestyle hotels, these operators are increasingly targeting consumers more concerned about health, convenience, service and ethical sourcing of food, who also form a significant part of the population.Embracing digital innovations and loyalty programs, these hotel bigwigs are relentlessly expanding their customer base and market share. Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience, which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently, stay longer and spend more.These, therefore, are a few reasons why the broader hotel space should continue doing well in both the short and medium term.Picking the Right StocksWe have taken the help of Zacks Stock Screener to pick hotel stocks which carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks are expected to see significant earnings growth in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report), a subsidiary of Hilton, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The consensus estimate for 2018 earnings is pegged at $6.94, suggesting a 20.1% year-over-year growth.The consensus estimate for Wyndham Worldwide Corporation’s  2018 earnings is $7.17 and is projected to grow 30.4% from the prior year. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

786,MAR,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  is currently one of the best-performing stocks in the hotel space. With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and decent share price appreciation the stock is a lucrative investment choice at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Shares of Wyndham have outperformed its industry in the past year. The stock has rallied 35.7% as compared with the industry’s growth of 31.5%.Moreover, an upward revision in earnings estimates for 2018 reflects analysts’ unwavering confidence in the company’s future earnings. Over the last 60 days, the consensus estimate for 2018 earnings rose 3.5%. Further, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, recording an average beat of 4.14%.La Quinta Acquisition to Enhance Margins & EarningsTraditionally, gross margin for hospitality companies are always comparatively higher as majority of its expenses come from cost of operations. However, the sector’s profit margin narrows, once these expenses from operations are taken into account. Consequently, net profit margin or net margin is considered the accurate metric for gauging the profits of hospitality companies. Wyndham’s trailing 12-month net margin is 15.4% higher than the industry’s 8.8%.Moreover, with the recent merger agreement with La Quinta Holdings, Wyndham’s expects $55 million to $70 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2019. This can be attributed to La Quinta’s asset-light, fee-for-service business structure which will further improve Wyndham’s margins and facilitate earnings growth.Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). In 2018, Wyndham’s earnings per share are expected to grow 24.7%.Robust Loyalty Program to Increase OccupancyIn order to survive the tough competition from hotel giants like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report), Wyndham is constantly devising newer ways to increase its share of market by raising occupancy. In order to enhance guest experience and drive occupancy, the company offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry. Currently, there are about 55 million members in Wyndham Rewards, an increase of 5.8% over prior year. In 2017, the company made Wyndham Rewards points redemption available to nearly 100 Wyndham Vacation Ownership properties, to generate new marketing opportunities between the two businesses.Solid Return to ShareholdersWyndham is consistently rewarding shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Ever since the initiation of its share repurchase program in 2007, the company has expanded the same by eight times and bought back shares worth $6 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s ongoing dividend policy is likely to grow its dividend at least at the rate of its earnings growth. Currently, Wyndham has a payout ratio of 42%. Further, it has a dividend yield of 2.4%, higher than the industry’s 0.1%. We appreciate the company’s efforts to consistently enhance shareholder returns.Moreover, the company delivered an ROE of 92.39% in the trailing 12 months compared with its industry’s 6.02%. This supports its immense growth potential and indicates that Wyndham reinvests more efficiently compared with peers.Valuation Looks StrongLooking at Wyndham’s Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) for the current fiscal year, investors might be willing to pay more as the company is undervalued compared with peers. The company’s P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months stands at 18.5 while that of the industry’s is 31x.Moreover, per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, Wyndham has a Value Score of B which indicates that the stock is most likely to outperform.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

787,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), in partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) Chase card services, has announced the debut of the World of Hyatt Credit Card. The credit card is expected to ease everyday purchase of travelers with greater rewards for members.The new card will promptly elevate customers’ status, aiding them to earn free nights at Hyatt destinations. Additionally, the card will provide added facilities in terms of points gain across services.We observe that Hyatt’s shares have rallied 36.1% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 12.7% collective rally.Let’s discuss the rationale behind the enhancement of World of Hyatt and its prospects.Loyalty Program Eyes Top-Line Growth, Fends Off CompetitionSuccessful innovation has been a trademark of Hyatt, with commitment of customer-friendly services in both the large-scale convention and smaller leisure markets. By enriching loyalty program with the introduction of credit card facilities, Hyatt is trying to facilitate greater guest engagement that would eventually raise occupancy. The company has been devising newer ways to enhance the guest loyalty program. In fact, it is already witnessing a higher level of guest satisfaction due to the enhancement of World of Hyatt. As of Dec 31, 2017, the loyalty program had more than 10 million active members. During 2017, approximately 30% of total system-wide room nights were favored by the program.Hyatt believes that enhanced guest experience should favor top-line growth. The company is trying to facilitate revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth by offering enriched services to guests, which has thereby generated substantial demand. With the introduction of Hyatt’s unique services that involve engaging more customers, the company is successfully navigating the tough economic environment, plagued with intense competition. The company has a creative approach to food and beverage at its hotels worldwide, and created profitable and popular venues that build and enhance demand for hotel properties.Strategies to engage customers therefore should help the company increase market share, thus boosting business. We believe that the strategies are part of Hyatt’s plan to leapfrog competitors like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) in the race to gain greater market share.Currently, Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

788,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc.’s (MAR  -  Free Report) consistent efforts to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in international markets are commendable. Recently, the company acquired the 1,000-room Sheraton Grand Phoenix hotel for $255 million.Marriott plans to renovate the hotel, which will begin in 2019. Apart from meeting space of nearly 77,000 square feet, the hotel has a fitness and business center along with lobby restaurants and poolside bar.Marriott’s president and CEO, Arne Sorenson said “The hotel will provide a living and breathing showcase of our new vision for the Sheraton brand, underscoring our commitment to restore the brand to its leadership position.”Currently, Marriott’s Sheraton brand operates about 450 hotels in over 70 countries across the globe. We note that Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence in international and domestic market to capitalize on growing demand for hotels. Notably, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company spanning across 127 countries, with more than 6,500 properties.In fact, Marriott’s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allows it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry. Given its property locations, we believe that the company is well poised to benefit from increasing market demand owing to stepped-up business as well as leisure traveling in major North American and international locations. Furthermore, Marriott is expected to benefit from a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes in the near as well as long term.  Also, global travel is estimated to increase at a 7% compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips expected to top 1.8 billion by 2030.Marriott currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stock PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has gained 24.8% compared with the industry’s 11.8% increase. Apart from Marriott, stocks such as Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Extended Stay America (STAY  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have witnessed growth of 36.1%, 11% and 26.5%, respectively.Although headwinds persist in the form of lingering political uncertainty in key international markets and currency headwinds, Marriott is well poised to grow in the long term backed by its continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

789,MAR,"There’s so much going on with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) right now that we can just hit the high spots now. These include a new CEO to head up its health insurance initiative, its physical expansion, its apartment house pickup service Hub and new skills for Alexa.Amazon & Banks Choose CEOAmazon’s ambition to crack healthcare or at least the insurance side of it through partnerships with leading banks took another step forward with the appointment of a CEO effective Jul 9. The Boston-based company will operate as an independent entity that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints with the goal of ensuring people take their prescriptions to thereby reduce health complications and cost. Healthier people will also be less of a burden for insurance companies.The person chosen for the job is Dr. Atul Gawande, a world famous surgeon, writer and public health innovator, specializing in general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He is also Professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, as well as founding executive director of the health systems innovation center, Ariadne Labs.“We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert’s knowledge, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation,” said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.“Atul embodies all three, and we’re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor.” Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), and Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) had similar words of praise for the incoming CEO.Amazon Expansion and EmploymentWe can debate about whether Amazon’s operating cost will increase as it creates more of a physical presence because this will require real estate and a larger employee base. In fact this is one of the biggest disadvantages that traditional retailers have to deal with when compared with Amazon. Moreover, once you’re already employing a lot of people like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), it is relatively harder to automate operations because retrenchment will put you up against labor unions.Amazon is making the most of its position as a mainly online retailer by significantly automating operations and processes and employing as few people as possible. This is visible in its Amazon Go shop concept and also in its fulfillment centers.So its fourth Michigan fulfillment center in Gaines Township, which is an 850,000 square foot facility, will create just a 1,000 full time jobs. Similarly, the new Bessemer fulfillment center (the first of its kind in the state of Alabama), which is an 855,000 square foot facility will employ just 1,500 employees. These employees, who will work alongside robots to pick, pack and ship small items to customers such as books, household items and toys, will however be well taken care of in terms of wages and benefits.What’s more, it isn’t just the mundane jobs of the warehouses that are being automated. Over time, Amazon has even shifted tasks like forecasting demand, ordering inventory and negotiating prices to algorithms.Amazon says in a statement, “We’ve been working for some time on standardizing the products, tools and services we offer to the brands and resellers that sell on Amazon, and have made some organizational changes as a result.” It also says that it has more than 16,000 corporate jobs open worldwide and that it had created 130,000 jobs last year.So Amazon’s physical expansion may not be as good as it might have been in terms of employment, but it’s good nonetheless because of the rate of expansion.Hub by AmazonAmazon recently announced Hub by Amazon, which is essentially a package pickup location for apartment buildings. The service is available not only on Amazon packages but also from others like UPS, FedEx, or even the Post Office.  Delivery persons enter their code to drop off packages while residents enter their code to pick them up at any time 24/7. Amazon offers security for the packages and also personal assistance if required. The facility helps Amazon deliver packages for pickup within one day.  Amazon says that the service is already available to 500,000 residents from 30 such locations across the U.S. Big residential property owners and managers, collectively overseeing thousands of apartment properties like AvalonBay, Fairfield Residential, Pinnacle, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, WinnResidential and Equity Residential, have already signed up to use the service.This looks like a rather neat way to creep into the broader logistics business.Alexa Acquires More SkillsAlexa acquired a number of skills over the past week or so-First, through Alexa for Hospitality, she can serve guests asking for hotel information, guest services, music playback in their room and more. The goal is to improve guest experience while offering them the kind of voice services many are now accustomed to in their own homes. Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) was the first big hotel to adopt the technology, introducing the new Alexa experience at select properties in Marriott Hotels, Westin Hotels & Resorts, St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, Aloft Hotels, and Autograph Collection Hotels starting this summer.Designed by tech startup n-Powered, college students can now ask Alexa questions, such as when their classes are scheduled, how much cash remains on their food cards and how much they owe for tuition. Northeastern University will be offering its students Echo Dots through which the service will be available but it isn’t known yet what if anything it will charge them for it.  It should make life easier for students and save faculty time, so other colleges may go for similar programs as well.A voice-based, music education startup called Bamboo Learning has released an Alexa skill called Bamboo Music that will help students learn and practice music theory through voice and listening exercises. The company was founded by Amazon veteran Ian Freed, who was VP of Amazon devices from 2010 to 2015 and helped design the Alexa-enabled Echo.Users will now be able to get Alexa to set recordings, launch apps and navigate menus on the Dish Hopper range of set-top boxes.Private-LabelD A Davidson analyst Tom Forte raised his price target on the stock from $1,900 to $2,100, because of “the increase in our annual sales forecasts by 100 basis points, per year, due to our increased confidence in its ability to generate additional private-label and advertising revenues.""With private-label growing in importance at Amazon, Coresight Research, in partnership with DataWeave, recently aggregated data on 6,825 products across 74 identified Amazon private labels to study their progress. Coresight had the following observations:The bulk of Amazon private labels are apparel brands with many sub categories containing relatively few (around 100) products each as Amazon tries to cater to a broad cross section of people with targeted offerings. But other leading retail categories like food and beauty haven’t received the same attention. With the acquisition of Whole Foods, the company gained access to its food brands, which are listed on its site. It appears that Amazon will take a similar approach to food and beauty as it has with apparel.Its private label brands are also getting a boost with Amazon Prime Wardrobe that is now available to all U.S. users. The system allows you to select at least three and at most eight items that you have a week to try on and reject if necessary. Amazon says that its private label brands Lark & Ro, Daily Ritual, Amazon Essentials, and Goodthreads are the top-ordered items, which could just be because its own brands are more widely available on the service.CustomersAmazon has reported that online retailer zulily has been moving its business critical workloads to AWS, including its store, mobile application, and supply chain, as it leverages the cloud to serve customers better. The press release said that zulily has seen a 30-40% performance improvement per request made on its website and mobile app.  Meanwhile, Sears  has announced that the number of its Auto Centers accepting Amazon tire pickup and fixing has now been increased by 71 to total 118. Sears collects a small fee for the service.Facial Recognition IssueAmazon employees are protesting its marketing of face-recognition technology called rekognition to private businesses and law-enforcement agencies. An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) investigation earlier this month showed that Amazon has been selling such information to police in Florida and Oregon.The WSJ reports that in fact anyone with a credit card and an Amazon Web Services account can access it. There is also no approval process for consumers, who can be tracked just about anywhere there is a camera, even if they aren’t carrying any devices.According to a recently-published letter posted to an internal forum, employees who called themselves Amazonians said that “Our company should not be in the surveillance business; we should not be in the policing business; we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations.” It also objected to and called for the cessation of infrastructure service provision to Palantir, the Peter Thiel-backed surveillance company, which has ties to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department.Seattle Head Tax Battle WonBig companies won the battle against homeless people when the Seattle City Council repealed a newly enacted ""head tax"" on the its largest companies by a 7-2 vote. The tax would have impacted only the largest companies by revenue, Amazon being one. It was expected to hit 500 companies that would have been required to pay a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city to raise at least $45 million over five years. The money was to go toward affordable housing and support services for the homeless.Amazon was one of the most vociferous opposers, threatening to take its business to other states to avoid the tax. Since this trend would have led to unemployment, the state was forced to reconsider. Amazon promptly said it would support non-profits working for the homeless.Senators Question Echo PrivacyA recent controversy over the way an Echo device inadvertently recorded a conversation and even sent it to an unintended recipient have raised privacy questions around the device.U.S. Senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons have written to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos requesting information about the technical design and privacy features of Echo devices as well as the Alexa digital assistant platform. Flake is chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, and Coons is a member.Supreme Court Ruling Will Have Minimal ImpactIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has said that states can tax online companies. The existing law based on physical presence hasn’t however been nullified.Since Amazon already collects taxes in all states in which it operates and also charges a fee for taking on the hassle for sellers that want the service, the decision is a slight positive for the retail business.For buyers, cost of products on Amazon’s marketplace (not the stuff it sells directly) could go up if the concerned sellers aren’t collecting sales tax. However, since Amazon is also in the process of integrating its marketplaces business into the retail business, so any negative impact on this business will likely be small for Amazon.One-Month Pice ActionRecommendationAmazon shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

791,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) The Unbound Collection by Hyatt brand offers a portfolio of upper-upscale and luxury build hotels, boutique properties, and resorts. The brand, which is swiftly gaining momentum, recently marked its entry in Turkey with the opening of a 45-roomed boutique hotel called Nish Palas Istanbul. Featuring the city’s historic and cultural attributes, the hotel, like all other Hyatt hotels, will provide guests with high-class experiences.The recent addition of the hotel is in line with an essential aspect of Hyatt’s riveting growth potential that focuses on its strong brand presence and continual expansion strategies. Also, shares of Hyatt have rallied 39% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 23.5%.Market Share Expansion, Top-Line GrowthHyatt’s continuous efforts toward expanding its brands globally should help it increase its market share. Hyatt is focused on expanding its presence worldwide and capitalizing on demand for hotels in profitable but relatively untapped international markets. In fact, other than Europe and Asia Pacific, the company also has expansion plans for Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Notably, courtesy of its aggressive expansion efforts, the company’s hotel opening agreements have continually outpaced its actual openings and this trend is expected to continue in the near future as well. The company has experienced net room growth between 6% and 7% for 10 consecutive quarters. In fact, for 2018, the company expects to grow units, on a net rooms basis, by roughly 6-6.5%, reflecting 60 new hotel openings.Further, we expect the recent launch to boost Hyatt’s Owned and Leased Hotels revenues. The performance of the segment was slightly weak in the last reported quarter. Revenues were down 2.5% year over year. However, comparable Owned and Leased hotels RevPAR increased 5.4% from the prior-year quarter.Countering CompetitionWe believe that by expanding its brands globally, Hyatt is trying to fend off competition from the likes of Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham  and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report). As it is, the hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains with their well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hyatt is continuously facing intense competition from both large hotel chains and smaller independent local hospitality providers.

792,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) announced the expansion of its loyalty program, World of Hyatt, to the leading provider of home service accommodation, known as Oasis. Guests opting for the home sharing space with Oasis can earn and redeem Hyatt’s loyalty points.Oasis home rentals belong to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt brand, especially designed for customers who demand home stays with luxury hotel amenities. Under the World of Hyatt loyalty program, members would be rewarded with 5 Base Points per dollar spent on Oasis nights and are allowedto redeem 15,000 points for a $200 credit toward an Oasis stay. Elite members can earn bonus points and are given late check-out options.Notably, Oasis’s operations across the globe expand Hyatt’s footprint in untapped markets like Barcelona, Ibiza, Punta del Este (Uruguay) and Trancoso (Brazil). The above move, thus, underscores Hyatt’s relentless expansion strategies to strengthen its brand position globally. It also indicates the company’s commitment toward devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy.We observe that Hyatt shares have rallied 45.5% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 39.2% growth.Let us discuss the rationale behind Hyatt’s expansion strategies, enhancementof World of Hyatt and its prospects.International Expansion to Counter CompetitionThe strategy is in-line with Hyatt’s consistent efforts to expand presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in relatively untapped international markets. In fact, the company also has expansion plans for Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. International expansion should help the company increase its market share, thus boosting its business. We believe that the strategy is also part of Hyatt’s plan to leapfrog competitors like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham  and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) in the race to expand in untapped markets.Loyalty Program Eyes at Top-Line GrowthSuccessful innovation has been a trademark of Hyatt, with a commitment to customer-friendly services in both the large-scale convention and smaller leisure markets. By expansion of its loyalty program beyond traditional hotel stays, Hyatt is trying to facilitate greater guest engagement in home spaces that would eventually raise occupancy. The company has been devising newer ways to enhance its guest loyalty program.

793,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) differentiated brand portfolio, strong expansion plans and acquisition strategies are encouraging. However, substantial international presence makes the company vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions and negative currency translation.Recently, Hyatt reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2017, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the last reported quarter, Hyatt’s aggressive expansion strategies in both domestic and international markets were well reflected in the top-line picture, whereas comparable owned and leased margin contraction affected the bottom line.Expansion & Other Initiatives to Drive SalesApart from owning widely recognized, industry-leading brands, an essential aspect of Hyatt’s riveting growth potential is its continual expansion of both full-service and select-service hotels. The continual expansion helps the company gain greater market share, aiding the top line.The company is trying to expand its presence worldwide and has expansion plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. In fact, for 2018, the company expects to grow units, on a net rooms basis, by roughly 6-6.5%, reflecting 60 new hotel openings.Hyatt strongly believes that the opportunity for properties that offer a select offering of services at a lower price than full-service hotels is particularly compelling in certain markets, including India, China and the Middle East. This is because there is a large and growing middle-class population in these markets along with significant number of local business travelers.In order to raise occupancy by enhancing guest experience, Hyatt is also devising newer ways like innovation of food and beverage at its hotels worldwide, and creation of profitable and popular venues that build demand for hotels.To this end, in first-quarter 2017, the company launched a new loyalty program, World of Hyatt, replacing its Gold Passport loyalty program. As of Dec 31, 2017, the loyalty program had over 10 million active members. During 2017, approximately 30% of total systemwide room nights were favored by the program.Meanwhile, the Hyatt Credit Card, a co-branded Visa credit card between Hyatt and Chase Card Services, continues to show strong growth in card member acquisitions and member engagement.Acquisitions & Divestitures as Growth Strategies Hyatt is strongly invested in the strategies related to various acquisitions and divestitures that can drive growth for the company. In January 2017, the company acquired Miraval Group, which extended the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel stays into a wellness category that resonates well with high-end travelers.Additionally, Hyatt is also focusing on the sale of assets. On Nov 9, 2017, Hyatt sold its 550-rommed Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa for approximately $60 million. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $17 million. Notably, this property sale was one of the six asset sales planned by the company.These strategies are in line with Hyatt’s efforts to strengthen its financial flexibility and focus more on core operation. The sale of assets is helping the company grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. Notably, a higher concentration of franchise fees reduces earnings volatility and provides a more stable growth profile. Additionally, asset sales are helping Hyatt in terms of strengthening its liquidity. This also allows the company to protect its current liabilities with a combination of cash and liquid assets.Concern of Considerable International ExposureHyatt has considerable international presence, which makes it vulnerable to economic conditions in the region.Since the company’s operations outside the United States represent approximately 20% of net revenues in 2017, the costs of complying with laws, regulations and policies (including taxation policies) of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, may affect the company’s profitability. Also, volatility in exchange rates is likely to hurt results as it has been doing over the past few quarters. Notably, the company has been witnessing a decline in international inbound travel, given a stronger dollar.Competition Remains a ChallengeThe hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hyatt is continuously facing intense competition from both large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report), and smaller independent local hospitality providers.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), search engines such as Google and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites, facilitating short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.Unless Hyatt counters these competitions with appropriate strategies, it may pose a concern to the company’s future profitability.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

794,MAR,"SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 8, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%. Notably, in three out of trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings missed the consensus mark.Q1 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether SeaWorld will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at a loss of 76 cents, wider than the loss of 66 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $197.7 million, up 6.1% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayHistorically, the first and fourth quarters of each year are seasonally weak for SeaWorld. The company’s top line is expected to decline sequentially but is poised to witness year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, SeaWorld is increasingly focusing on its marketing strategy to highlight brand attributes and new additions. All of these are expected to boost attendance in the quarter under review. Further, in an effort to drive attendance, the company is introducing new rides at most of its parks. However, declining attendance in California, Texas and Florida markets has been a cause of concern for the company.Furthermore, the company earlier launched tactical pricing initiatives at several of its locations. The combination of direct price increases and dynamic pricing initiatives might drive admissions per capita in the quarter under review. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the company’s sincere efforts to control costs without denting efficiency and improve financial standing through debt refinancing. The company expects to achieve net cost savings of $40 million by the end of 2018.SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.

795,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12%.Q1 ExpectationsThe question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Marriott will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.25, higher than $1.01 in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In the fourth quarter of 2017, it witnessed earnings growth of 31.8% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $5,753 million, up 3.5% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayWe believe Marriott’s top line in the first quarter is likely to be driven by decent RevPAR growth across both domestic and international markets, courtesy of increased scale and distribution post Starwood acquisition and strong leisure demand. Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in the near as well as long term.  In the last reported quarter, worldwide, system-wide RevPAR rose 4.6%.Increasing business and leisure travel backed by improving economic indicators and positive employment numbers along with strong transient demand is likely to boost Marriott’s performance in the first quarter. Rising North American business and large international exposure also bode well for the company.Additionally, the company is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. For 2018, it anticipates gross room additions of 7%, which is likely to continue building economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.We expect higher RevPAR, solid cost controls and synergies from Starwood acquisition to contribute significantly to the company’s margin improvement, which in turn should boost EPS.Marriott International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Marriott International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Marriott is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

796,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.’s (HLT  -  Free Report) relentless expansion strategies, coupled with an asset-light business model and a strong loyalty program put the company on growth trajectory amid a competitive industry. In first-quarter 2018, Hilton reported better-than-expected earnings for the sixth straight quarter. The bottom line increased 44.7% on a year-over-year basis.Improving economic indicators, along with elevated demand for leisure and business travel are also helping Hilton to gain traction. Driven by a robust brand image, Hilton’s shares have gained 34.8% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%.Unit Expansion & Loyalty Program Continue to Drive Top Line In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, the company achieved net unit growth of 7,100 rooms and witnessed a 7% increase from the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Expanding its footprint, Hilton is continuously trying to meet the growing demand for hotels and drive its top line. Revenues in the first quarter increased 9.4% year over year driven by the rise in rate and occupancy, as well as robust demand at the company’s international hotels.Meanwhile, Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 74 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added in excess of 11 million members to the program. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. The company continues to make multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system, thereby driving revenues.Capital-Light Business Model to Boost Shareholders’ ReturnsHilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business, backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts, as well as its timeshare business. This asset-light model is expected to allow shareholders to receive high returns on invested capital. In fact, in the first quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for roughly $110 million, at an average price per share of $84.01. The company aims to strengthen its shareholders’ value through regular dividend payment and buybacks, going forward. This reinstates our faith in the company’s strong fundamentals and cash-flow position.Intense Competition Remains a HeadwindThe hotel industry is highly competitive as major hospitality chains, along with their well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hilton is continuously facing intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), as well as smaller independent local hospitality providers.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources such as Airbnb and HomeAway, allowing travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms.Also, compared with other big hotel chains, Hilton is seen to have a lower mix of luxury and upper upscale rooms. An increasing supply of such upscale hotels may not have a rewarding impact on Hilton. Unless this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company develops its luxury portfolio alongside other rooms, it has a good chance of losing out on the emerging demand.

797,MAR,"Impressive performances by U.S. hotel companies in first-quarter 2018 has raised expectations for the remainder of the year.Underpinning this favorable view is the positive outlook for the U.S. economy, thanks to healthy consumer spending, a strong labor market, rising government expenditures and increased consumer confidence.The U.S. economy is anticipated to grow at an annualized rate of 4% in the second quarter, per the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow forecast model (as of May 25). This marks a sharp increase from 2.3% GDP growth registered in the first quarter of 2018.  Robust domestic data gives an indication that the industry will continue its bull run in the second half of 2018.Thus, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over the short and the long term. Below, we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming period:Steady Growth in DemandThe supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010 with growth in demand outpacing supply growth. Though, of late, the gap between demand and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has decelerated, higher average daily rates (ADRs) will continue to drive revenue per available room (RevPAR).Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year, which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U.S. lodging industry, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) projects demand (+2.4%) to outpace supply (+2.0%) in 2018. Further, in 2019, it anticipates demand and supply growth of 1.9% each. Occupancy in 2018 is likely to increase 0.3% to 66.3%.International Expansion to Drive GrowthMost of the hotel companies are exploring international expansion, especially in relatively untapped emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities. Unsaturated markets in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Brazil, Russia and Africa are being targeted by hospitality companies.China, which is the largest source market for outbound travel, is the most significant market for the hotel industry. In less than two decades China has become the world’s most powerful outbound market for hotels and leisure.Interestingly, the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) which entered into a joint venture with Alibaba with an aim to improve market share, expand membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs. India is also becoming a hot spot for U.S.-based hotel businesses as it gains precedence as a global business hub. Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China, the country has great long-term growth potential as a tourism market.In fact, Hyatt Hotels Corp.’s (H  -  Free Report) major target markets include India and China. Apart from these, the company also has expansion plans for diverse international markets including Australia, Brazil, Germany, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and the Netherlands, among others.Meanwhile, Europe remains an attractive market despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit-induced uncertainties. Major players like Marriott, Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels (CHH  -  Free Report) and WyndhamWorldwide WYN have a strong foothold in this region.Several players in the space are also looking to leverage from rise in accommodation demand in Latin America. In this respect, WyndhamHotel Group acquired Latin America's leading Fen Hotels. Meanwhile, with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75% by 2018.Loyalty Programs Attract CustomersLoyalty programs are one of the major driving factors in the hotel industry. In order to survive in a tough economic environment, the companies continuously devise ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy. Given the fact that reward members stay longer than non-members and generate more revenues for their franchisees, hotel chains have been increasingly focusing on loyalty programs.Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 74 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added over 11 million members to the program. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. Innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in the program.With about 52 million members, Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry. In fact, per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company, Wyndham Rewards is touted as the most-rewarding loyalty program in the U.S. hotel industry.Recently, Marriott International announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company’s loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent.The new loyalty program will provide members more than what was offered under the prior programs. Under this global loyalty program, members can book stays, and earn or redeem points across 29 brands covering 6,500 hotels in 127 countries and territories.Digital InnovationsIn an era of stiff competition, hotel companies are leaving no stone unturned to drive growth. In this regard, digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role. Social media can enhance a brand’s prospects by connecting directly with guests, especially millennials and can, in turn, increase loyalty and market share. Social media sites like Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP  -  Free Report) are commonly used by travelers to select hotels and in this way these enhance a brand’s prospects by connecting directly with guests.Moreover, hotel chains use apps to help guests manage bookings and offer interactive maps/GPS to increase occupancy and offer a faster and seamless experience. The companies are investing in mobile check-in, fast Wi-Fi and digital room keys to enhance guest experience.In fact, mobile check-ins and check-outs have increased substantially over the past few years and so has the enthusiasm for chat-based messaging apps, like chatbots, among potential customers. Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry.The companies are also using analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience, which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently, stay longer and spend more.Key PicksCurrently, a top-ranked stock in the hotel space is Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marriott Vacations’ earnings for 2018 are projected to increase 22.3%. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in the trailing three out of four quarters, with an average beat of 19.5%.Stocks like Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide and Hyatt Hotels, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), are also likely to do well given positive industry sentiments.Clearly, the hotel industry offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Hotel Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for the industry.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

798,MAR,"Stocks in the hotel industry are benefiting from growth in demand that supports increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). The momentum in the U.S. hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the industry witnessed a better-than-expected rise in demand, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing by 3.5%.Consequently, stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year, handily outperforming the broader market, as a reflection of this positive backdrop. The Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has rallied 20.2%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s gain of 14.5%.The industry looks attractive, owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand. Further, we note that rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The U6 unemployment rate, which includes people forced into part-time work and people sporadically looking for jobs, declined to 7.6%, the lowest level witnessed since May 2001.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing in 2018. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4.8% (annualized rate) GDP growth in second-quarter 2018.Numbers Look ImpressiveA recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 2% in 2018, up from 1.8% in 2017. This is likely to result in 0.3% increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66.3%. Moreover, ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2.6% and 3%, respectively this year. In 2019, the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2.8% each.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 1.6% in April 2018. In fact, in a year, the index has gained 12.7%.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. However, the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017. Despite this, the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental.Decline in International Travel a ConcernFall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U.S. lodging industry. Moreover, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States, given Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas,is detrimental to hotels. If the U.S. dollar gains strength, this may keep industry growth in check, given its impact on inbound international travel.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds.Meanwhile, hotel companies have been focusing on renovation, and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits. High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers. In fact, online travel agents like Booking.com (BKNG  -  Free Report), Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service, allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report). Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Driving GrowthThe hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018, raising optimism for hotel companies. Moreover, hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Also, these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home-sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.So far in 2018, the hotel industry has proved to be resilient amid marketplace shift. Going forward, the industry is likely to witness continued success.Thus, as hotel companies strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among millennials – will remain priorities. Focused investment in infrastructure to attract business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Valuation PictureLooking at the industry’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), the space’s valuation picture remains a bit stretched. The industry is currently trading at 16.81X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA. Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.62X and as low as 10.8X, with a median of 13.95X. The S&P 500 Index is currently at 11.54X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, with the broader index’s five-year high, low and median at 12.67X, 7.49X, and 9.8 X, respectively.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 255 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industry is currently #212 (Bottom 17%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsThe Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, per the latest report, earnings have grown 15.2% in the first quarter while total revenues are up 6%.Meanwhile, for the second quarter, revenues are expected to rise 6%, and earnings are projected to record a gain of 8.2%. For 2018, while revenues are expected to rise 5.8%, earnings are anticipated to increase 12%.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trend report. ConclusionThe U.S. hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy, higher income, increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market. As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand.The U.S. economy expanded at a pace of 2.3% in the first quarter, above the consensus estimate. However, it represents a decline from 3% witnessed in the last three quarters of 2017. While declines were felt across all components, consumer spending declined significantly after strong gains in the fourth quarter of 2017.This may appear to be a concern at the first glance but first-quarter figures have been dismal in recent years due to statistical and weather-related issues. Other consumer-related indicators are on the rise, which means that consumer spending should pick up in the rest of the year. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point. Further, the U.S. economy is expected to expand at a 4% annualized rate in the second quarter, per the latest forecast by Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow.Thus, we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and bottom lines in the near-to-middle term, especially when the unemployment rate is at a 18-year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

799,MAR,"Steady sales growth holds the key to survival in an ever changing and highly competitive business environment. But when it comes to picking stocks, investors often ignore sales growth as a dependable metric. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum.But it’s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur losses, albeit temporarily, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Further, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense control measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, sustainable bottom-line growth invariably requires higher revenues.Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can be an apt metric for stock valuation. The importance of this metric lies in the fact that management has limited scope to manipulate revenues unlike earnings.While sales growth provides investors an understanding of product demand and pricing power, it doesn’t reflect whether the company is operating efficiently. A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.So, a consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) operates, franchises, and licenses hotel, residential, and timeshare properties. The company has expected sales growth rate of 4.5% for the current year and carries a Zacks Rank #2.American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) provides life insurance products and services. This West Des Moines, IA-based stock has expected sales growth rate of 5.1% for 2018 and sports a Zacks Rank #1.The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), based in Wilmington, DE, provides performance chemicals.

800,MAR,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than X-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:Teradyne, Inc.

802,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company’s loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. The new loyalty program will also enrich members with more than what was offered under the prior programs.Under this global loyalty program, members can book stays, and earn or redeem points across 29 brands covering 6,500 hotels in 127 countries and territories. Additionally, the company’s newly launched Marriott Moments, allowing guests to shop for and book unique experiences, will also undergo expansion under the unified program.Moreover, the loyalty program will facilitate members with the option of earning status based on room nights, with the highest level of status requiring $20,000 in annual spending. Membership status can also be heightened using co-branded credit cards with American Express Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report).Notably, shares of Marriott have rallied 45% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.6%.Loyalty Programs a Big Hit Among HoteliersThe move underscores Marriott’s aggressive expansion of its loyalty base, with which it aims to meet guest expectations, while driving hotel profitability for owners and franchisees. Notably, loyalty programs have proved to be effective in raising occupancy and driving revenues for hotel companies, as major bigwigs like Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) are all aggressively looking to enhance their loyalty programs.Marriott has also recognized its loyalty program as the most powerful marketing platform, and thus continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations to provide a more rewarding experience to the guests. The company’s leading loyalty programs leverage its distribution, driving guest preference and significant revenue per available room (RevPAR) index premiums.Other Initiatives by Marriott to Build LoyaltyDigital innovations and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in hotel bookings. Social media enhances the brand’s prospects by connecting directly with guests, which in turn can lead to increased loyalty and market share. The Marriott mobile app for tablets and smartphones helps guests to manage their bookings, access interactive maps/GPS as well as reward programs. Moreover, Marriott recently re-imagined its Marriott Mobile app to meet the needs of modern world travelers. Its guests will now be able to enjoy new and extended digital features, customized travel content, easier one-button navigation and a new swipe-able discovery home screen.Moreover, the company has rolled out guestVoice to measure guests’ feedback, introduced SPG Mobile check-in and check-out in North America, and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings.Additionally, MLive, real-time marketing brand newsroom and social media command center are worth mentioning.

803,MAR,"Shares of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) are riding high on the rise in rate and occupancy, robust demand at the company’s international hotels and improved strategic initiatives. These efforts have aided the company to drive its share price by 30.2% in a year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 20.8%. However, intense competition and cyclical nature of the industry remain concerns. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystsIn a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, the company witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, in the first quarter of 2018, the company achieved net unit growth of 7,100 rooms and witnessed an increase of 7% from the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Hilton’s broad geographic diversity lowers the effect of volatility in individual markets. Evidently, Mexico and Canada have been experiencing strong leisure demand, leading to solid RevPAR growth. Further, Europe’s RevPAR trends are being supported by favorable exchange rates as well as strength in regions including Spain, the U.K., Germany, Turkey and others. Meanwhile, strength in China and Japan has led to solid RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region as well.The company has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 74 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added over 11 million members to the program. Further, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors in the first quarter of 2018. In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in the program.Further, Hilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-offs of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as timeshare business. Post spin-off, the company expects to be a resilient, fee-driven business with disciplined strategies. In fact, the focus is expected to be on growing market share, units, free cash flow per share as well as preserving its strong balance sheet and accelerating return of capital. Furthermore, as Hilton’s unit growth is mostly financed by third parties, the company is capable of generating substantial returns on minimal capital investment. ConcernsCompared with other big hotel chains, Hilton has a lower mix of luxury and upper upscale rooms. An increasing supply of such upscale hotels may not have a rewarding impact on Hilton. Unless the company develops its luxury portfolio alongside its other rooms, it has a good chance of losing out on the emerging demand.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA), search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources such as Airbnb and HomeAway, allowing travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, consequently providing an alternative to hotel rooms. Further, intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) as well as smaller independent local hospitality providers remains a potent threat.Zacks Rank & Key PickHilton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock from the same space is Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters.

804,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), through a strategic partnership with Country Garden Hotels Group, is lining up new hotel openings. The Country Garden properties under this agreement will be managed by Hilton’s DoubleTree by Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn brands. Hilton’s partnership with Country Garden, China’s largest property developer will enable the brand to strengthen its hold in China.In fact, the move is in line with Hilton’s strategic efforts to capitalize the flourishing tourism and leisure industry in China. Per a report by World Tourism Economy, the number of inbound tourist arrivals in China increased to 11.88 billion in 2017 compared with 11.12 billion in 2016 and the upside trend is likely to continue in 2018 as well.Hilton has a portfolio of 470 properties, either operating or under construction in China. In April, the hotelier further expanded its presence in the country by opening Hampton by Hilton Shunde Longjiang, Foshan and the Hampton by Hilton Suzhou Xiangcheng District.Continual Expansion as Major Growth DriverThe recent move underscores Hilton’s expansion strategy that is expected to put the company on a continued growth trajectory. In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, the company achieved net unit growth of 7,100 rooms and witnessed a 7% increase from the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Hilton’s broad geographic diversity lowers the effect of volatility in individual markets. Evidently, Mexico and Canada have been experiencing strong leisure demand, leading to solid RevPAR growth. Meanwhile, strength in China and Japan have led to solid RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region as well. Notably, the company continues to make great progress in its luxury development strategy, anticipating double-digit luxury growth in the next several years. Hilton’s new brands including Home2 Suites, Tru by Hilton and Tapestry Collection are also gaining momentum globally.Expansion Fends Off CompetitionHilton’s relentless expansion also helps the company in strategizing against a growing competition in the industry. The hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains along with their well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hilton is continuously facing intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report). It is also facing competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report). Hilton, therefore, through its disciplined, strategic operations and expansion is trying to navigate stiff competition.Driven by these strategic efforts and a robust brand image, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have increased 23.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.6%.

805,MAR,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation’s  subsidiary, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, has completed the buyout of La Quinta Holdings' hotel franchising and hotel management business.The acquisition will help Wyndham to significantly improve its hotel management business and strengthen its brand presence globally. La Quinta has an asset-light, fee-for-service business structure, which consists of nearly 900 managed and franchised hotels. On the flipside, Wyndham operates a portfolio of 20 lodging brands and has approximately 9,000 hotels across 80 countries and six continents.La Quinta, being one of the largest midscale brands in the industry, is likely to drive Wyndham Hotel Group's midscale presence and help it enter the fast-growing upper-midscale segment. Earlier, Wyndham had projected that the deal will result in $55 million to $70 million of annual cost savings and also boost revenues significantly by the end of 2019.As it is, Wyndham is constantly trying to expand globally through acquisitions as the firms acquired so far have properties in Europe, North America and Latin America.We believe that expansion through acquisitions is helping hotels consolidate and strengthen their presence worldwide. With intensifying competition from different sites like Airbnb or Priceline, the fusing of different hotels will lend a scale advantage to individual hoteliers. Also, companies can rake in higher profits in the competitive market by uniting their resources.As announced earlier, Wyndham Worldwide’s board of directors has given a green signal for spinoff of its hotel business – Wyndham Hotel Group – resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts will trade under the symbol “WH” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) beginning Jun 1, 2018. Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.4% compared with the industry’s increase of 17.5%.

806,MAR,"In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is continuing to drive unit growth. Of late, the company announced that two of its marketing leading brands — Curio Collection and Tapestry Collection — will boost its portfolio with seven hotels in the United States.Following the news, shares of Hilton gained 1.7% yesterday.

Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to boost the program.In fact, more than half of the occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.This apart, Hilton maintains strong fundamentals and cash flow position that are beneficial for its shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, the company has transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business. Bottom LineHilton is continuously trying to meet growing demand for hotels and drive its top line by expanding its footprint in the United States.

In 2017, the company added over 11 million members to the program.In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in the program. In addition to being the company’s fastest growing and lowest cost distribution channel, this app, launched in December 2017, also enables a differentiated customer experience.Additionally, starting in November 2017, Hilton’s partner American Express (Amex) has launched and will be marketing a portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the country, which will help the program’s membership to grow.Hilton, thus, continues to make multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Capital-Light Business Model to Reward ShareholdersHilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business, backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business. The focus is primarily on growing market share, units, free cash flow per share as well as preserving the company’s strong balance sheet and accelerating return of capital. Furthermore, as Hilton’s unit growth is mostly financed by third parties, the company is capable of generating substantial returns on minimal capital investment.This asset-light model should allow shareholders to receive high returns on invested capital. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 3.5 million shares of its common stock for roughly $266 million and an average price per share of $74.67. The company aims to strengthen shareholders’ value through regular dividend payment and buybacks, going forward. This reinstates our faith in the company’s strong fundamentals and cash-flow position.Competition Remains a ChallengeThe hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hilton is continuously facing intense competition from both large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), as well as smaller independent local hospitality providers.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), search engines such as Google and peer-to-peer inventory like Airbnb and HomeAway that allow travelers to book stays on websites, facilitating short-term rental homes and apartments from owners.Unless Hilton counters these competitions with appropriate strategies, it may pose a concern to the company’s future profitability.Zacks RankHilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

810,MAR,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), which manufactures and sells steel and steel products, has a VGM Score of B. Its expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is pegged at 12%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lithia Motors, Inc. (LAD  -  Free Report), which operates automotive franchises, and retails new and used vehicles, has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.9% for 3-5 years. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report), which provides postsecondary education services, has a VGM Score of B. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 14.5% for 3-5 years.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, manufactures, sales and services commercial jetliners, military aircraft, has a VGM Score of B. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 13.8% for 3-5 years.Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), which operates, franchises, and licenses hotel, has a VGM Score of B.

812,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of Tru by Hilton Las Vegas Airport, the midscale brand’s eighth hotel in the United States.Managed by Dallas-based Prism Hotels & Resorts, Tru by Hilton Las Vegas Airport, with six floors and 166 rooms, is the largest Tru by Hilton hotel property to date. The hotel is in close proximity to the McCarran International Airport, Vegas Strip and other entertainment areas.Hiltonis known for its scale, size and commercial platform. The company currently has a portfolio of 14 world-class brands, comprising more than 5,100 properties with nearly 838,000 rooms in 103 countries and territories. Hilton has also considerably fortified its global hold apart from expanding in the domestic market.We observe that the stock has rallied 16.6% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 9%.Brand Portfolio Expansion in FocusThe latest hotel launch not only boosts the company’s brand portfolio but will also help it gain traction in the domestic market. Notably, Tru by Hilton has the fastest growing developmental pipeline within the hospitality industry, courtesy of its relentless expansion efforts and a current portfolio of 470 hotels in various stages of development.Meanwhile, given the improving economic indicators in the United States, the demand for hotels is steadily growing. Though increasing supply growth is expected to limit occupancy levels, overall demand in the country is expected to rise substantially on stronger group travel. This upbeat scenario is expected to benefit Hilton to a large extent.Notably, Tru by Hilton is a part of Hilton Honors, which is one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 70 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer-centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.In addition to enhancing customer loyalty, Hilton maintains strong fundamentals and cash flow position, which are beneficial for its shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, the company has opted for a more capital-light operating business model backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderHilton has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

813,MAR,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

814,MAR,"After experiencing a strong 2017, the hotel industry is likely to enjoy another successful year. A confluence of factors is working in favor of the sector at the moment. Firstly, the economy remains strong and the labor market continues to strengthen. Also, the recent jump in yearly wage growth bears evidence of the fact that the American consumer is likely to have even greater levels of disposable levels of income over the rest of the year.According to the recently released Deloitte 2018 Travel and Hospitality Industry Outlook, the hotel industry is likely to expand by 5-6% over 2018. This is likely to result in record gross bookings of around $170 billion.In January, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) indicated that a strong economy and recent tax cuts would fuel the highest rates of occupancy for the hospitality industry since 1981. According to PwC, occupancy is likely to increase to 66.1% for hotels in the United States in 2018.With Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) both scheduled to report on Feb 14, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings on Feb 14 include Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance over the last three months, Marriott has gained 13.2%, higher than the broader industry’s 9.9% increase over the same period. On the other hand, Hilton has gained 10.8% over this period, which exceeds the broader industry’s performance but falls behind Marriott.Current RatioThe hospitality industry requires a large quantum of working capital. Additionally, it also needs to service a number of short-term financial obligations. This is why liquidity ratios are an essential component of the industry’s analysis.The current ratio measures the ability of a company to meet short-term debt obligations. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and expresses to that of the current level of liabilities. Here, Hilton is a clear winner with a current ratio of 0.94, which is superior to the industry average of 0.72 as well as Marriott’s reading of 0.53.Debt RatioThe hospitality industry is characterized by a high level of long term debt as well as current liabilities. Such high levels of debt are required to finance, maintain and operate large cruise lines as well. Given the high proportion of long term assets, debt financing over an extended period is a necessary requirement.Since the sector has a high level of financial leverage, debt ratios naturally come into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to services long term debt. Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios. This implies that assets are present in higher proportion compared to debt over the long term.Here Hilton is at a disadvantage with a debt ratio of 46.5%, which is higher than the industry average of 41.1%. At 35.8%, Marriott has a debt component, which is lower than both Hilton’s as well as the industry.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, Marriott has provided a dividend yield of 0.95%, marginally higher than the industry average of 0.94. In comparison, Hilton offers a dividend of 0.73%. Hence, on a comparable basis, Marriott shareholders earned better dividend yield than those of Hilton.ValuationThe most appropriate metric to capital-intensive companies like hotels is the EV/EBITDA multiple. This ratio helps to overcome several of the drawbacks of the P/E ratio. This is because, unlike P/E, the EV/EBITDA ratio accounts for both the debt and shareholder perspectives.With an EV/ EBITDA value of 21.6, Marriott is clearly overvalued compared with the industry which as an EV/EBITDA value of 12.77. In contrast, Hilton is a cheaper stock with an EV/EBITDA value of 11.19.Gross MarginCompanies which are part of the hospitality industry generate billions of dollars of revenues. Additionally, several companies are well established which implies that appreciably high profit margins are generated by companies with differing market capitalizations.With a gross margin TTM value of 16.1%, Marriott underperforms its smaller rival Hilton on this count. On the other hand, Hilton sports a gross margin TTM value of 72.6%, which outperforms Marriott as well as the broader industry, which has a gross margin TTM value of 36.8%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsWhen considering Earnings ESP, Hilton is a clear winner with an ESP value of +0.13%, which is superior to Marriott’s reading of -1.11%. The situation is similar when comparing the increase in earnings estimates over the last thirty days. While Marriott’s estimate has increased by 2.1%, Hilton is better off on this count since its estimate has increased by 3.9% over the same period.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Hilton and Marriott have delivered positive surprises in each of the trailing four quarters. However, Hilton has a superior average earnings surprise of 19.2% compared to Marriott’s figure of 9.1%.ConclusionBoth Hilton and Marriott carry a Zacks Rank #2, so there is little to choose between the two on this count. However, our comparative analysis shows that Marriott has an edge over Hilton when considering price performance, debt ratios and dividend yields.But when considering valuations, gross margins and current ratios, Hilton is a superior stock. Hilton is also ahead when considering their comprehensive earnings histories and estimate revisions.What clinches the case firmly in favor of Hilton is a superior ESP value of +0.13% than Marriott’s reading of -1.11%. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Hilton over Marriott as they prepare to report earnings on Feb 14.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

815,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after the bell.In the quarter, we expect the company to post an encouraging performance on both counts driven mainly by significant RevPAR (revenue per available room) growth. In fact, the company is witnessing increased RevPAR in most markets around the world over the last few quarters.Notably, over the past year, Marriott stock has rallied 56%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 35.1% growth.Higher RevPAR and Starwood Synergy to Drive the Top Line The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marriott’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $5.6 billion. This, when compared with the year-ago actual figure, reflects growth of 3.1%. We believe that this anticipated growth will mainly be driven by decent RevPAR growth across both domestic as well as international markets owing to increased scale and distribution post Starwood purchase and strong leisure demand. In the last reported quarter, worldwide, system-wide RevPAR rose 2.1%.Increasing business and leisure travel on the back of improving economic indicators and positive employment numbers, along with strong transient demand is likely to boost performance in the quarter. Rising North American business and large international exposure bode well for the company.Cost Controls and RevPAR Growth to Boost EPS The consensus mark for adjusted EPS stands at $1, reflecting an increase of 17.6% from the year-ago actual figure. We expect higher RevPAR, solid cost controls and synergies from Starwood acquisition to contribute significantly to margin improvement, which in turn will boost EPS. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share increased 26.4% year over year.Marriott International EPS Diluted (TTM) Marriott International EPS Diluted (TTM) | Marriott International QuoteOur Model Does Not Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

816,MAR,"On Feb 16, The University of Chicago said that its consumer sentiment index had increased in February to its second-highest level since 2004. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and continuing resilience in the jobs market were primarily responsible for this increase. These factors helped Americans ignore recent volatility in the equity markets, which threatened to snap a long streak of gains.Steady growth and resilience in the jobs market have been the highlights of the continuing economic expansion. The impetus generated by recent tax cuts will also help to raise the disposable income of U.S. citizens. This is why this is an excellent time to invest in consumer discretionary stocks.Second-highest Level in 14 YearsThe University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index increased from 95.7 in January to 99.9 in February. This was the highest level recorded since 2004 and the second highest recorded since the 13-year high hit in October 2017. This reading exceeded most economists’ expectations who had estimated that the gauge would hit between 95.5 and 95.7.  The current conditions index, which is a gauge of Americans’ opinion about their finances, increased from 110.5 to 115.1. Additionally, the expectations index increased from 86.3 to 90.2. The overall number experienced a 4.4% increase from January’s figure of 95.7. Meanwhile, expectations for current year inflation levels remained unchanged at 2.7%.Tax Cuts, Jobs Growth Boost Sentiment The survey indicates that consumers are choosing to concentrate on encouraging economic data. This includes an increase in income levels, a booming job market and other related factors. Such a mindset was not impacted by recent stock market gyrations.According to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin, only 6% of the respondents chose to recall discouraging news related to the equity markets, that too when prompted.

818,MAR,"Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 8.29%. It recorded earnings beats in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 16.97%.Shares of the company have gained 15.9% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 56.5%.Revenue Growth Range SlashedThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.73 billion, reflecting 6.4% year-over-year growth.In the to-be-reported quarter, revenues at the U.S and Canada segment are expected to grow driven by strength in the company’s Franchise Brands, Partner Brand, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brand. International segment revenues are expected to increase on the back of solid Franchise Brand and Hasbro Gaming revenues across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues are expected to rise on the entertainment initiatives and higher consumer product sales.However, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy will keep Hasbro’s top line under pressure. The bankruptcy disrupted the company’s growth plans for the fourth quarter and had even paused shipments for a short period. Taking into account the adverse impacts that are expected to continue, the company has revised its fourth-quarter revenue growth guidance to the range of 4% to 7%, lower than its earlier projection.Earnings to Grow Despite Adverse Operating EnvironmentThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.82, mirroring nearly 11% year-over-year growth. We believe that this growth is attributable to the company’s efficient cost structure coupled with various sales-boosting efforts to counter the challenging operating environment in some key markets.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatHasbro does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%.

819,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is known for its scale, size and commercial platform. The company has a portfolio of more than 100 hotels and resorts in Latin America and is actively pursuing growth opportunities in the area.Also, the company has fortified its global hold apart from expanding in the domestic market.In line with this expansion strategy, Curio Collection by Hilton recently launched Mahogany Bay Resort & Beach Club in Belize, an independent country bordered by Mexico in the north. Marking the company’s first property in the country and one of the first branded resorts in Belize, Mahogany Bay features 205 cottage and villa-style rooms and offers various amenities. The hotel lies in close proximity to the San Pedro Airport and San Pedro, the only town on the island.Notably, Curio Collection by Hilton was launched in 2014 and has been performing really well ever since. The brand currently has a global portfolio of more than 40 remarkable, upper upscale hotels and resorts. The latest hotel launch not only adds to the company’s brand portfolio but will also help it gain traction in untapped markets.The new hotel is also part of Hilton Honors, which is one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 70 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.In addition to enhancing customer loyalty, Hilton maintains strong fundamentals and cash flow position, which are beneficial for the company’s shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, Hilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business.On Jan 4, Hilton completed the spin-off of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report), resulting in three independent, publicly-traded companies. On the same day, the company put the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split into effect. All these developments are expected to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, with substantial global expansion potential.Post the split, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 32.3% to date and the S&P 500 market has gained 16.3%.However, macroeconomic fluctuations, unfavorable currency translation and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might dent Hilton’s top line.Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company can continue gaining traction on aggressive expansion plans.

The revenue growth was primarily attributable to growth in the company’s base business.Pool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pool Corporation QuoteNotably, Pool Corp’s shares declined 1.3% in after-hours trading following the earnings release. However, the company’s shares have rallied 36.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 23.5%.Let’s take a detailed look at the company’s fourth-quarter results.Segmental PerformancePool Corp reports operations under two segments, the Base Business segment (constituting majority portion of the business) and the Excluded segment (sale centers excluded from base business).The Base Business segment witnessed sales growth of 13.3% year over year.

821,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results.Adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 cents and increased 31.8% year over year.  The bottom line also came ahead of the guided range of 98 cents to $1. Total revenues of $5.9 billion outpaced the consensus mark by $248 million and improved 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Marriott International Revenue (TTM) Marriott International Revenue (TTM) | Marriott International QuoteStrong RevPAR gains, room growth and property-level margin improvement drove the company’s results. Notably, with its owners and franchisees, Marriott opened more than 76,000 rooms in 2017 to cross the 1.25 million total room mark.Management remains optimistic about achieving significant cost synergies on faster integration of Starwood. We believe that Marriott is poised to grow on the back of the Starwood acquisition, arresting brand position, an increased demand for travel and significant international exposure.In a year’s time, shares of Marriott have rallied a whopping 62.3% outperforming the industry’s 40.4% gain.Let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s fourth-quarter results.RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter under review, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 4.6% in constant dollar (up 5.3% in actual dollars) driven by 1.8% growth in occupancy and 2% improvement in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came above management’s guided range of an increase of 2% to 3% on a constant dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 3.9% in constant dollars (up 4.1% in actual dollars). Occupancy rate and ADR also witnessed an increase of 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Management had expected the same to rise in the 2-3% band on a constant-dollar basis.In constant dollar, international comparable system-wide RevPAR rose 6.2% (up 8.4% in actual dollars). Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 2.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Also, the figure came above management’s guided range of 3% to 5% on a constant-dollar basis.Notably, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margin increased 80 basis points (bps) for full year 2017. The uptick was owing to higher RevPAR, solid cost controls, improved productivity and synergies from the Starwood acquisition. North American comparable company-operated house profit margins improved 40 bps as well. Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 130 bps.Total adjusted expenses increased 7.5% year over year to $5.2 billion mainly owing to higher general, administrative and other expenses.General, administrative and other expenses were $259 million, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The figure was also above management’s projected range of $240 million to $245 million.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $808 million, up 7% year over year.First-Quarter 2018 OutlookMarriott plans to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, a new revenue standard, in the first quarter of 2018. Considering significant changes upon adoption of the new standard and migration to a single financial reporting platform, the company has provided a condensed guidance for the quarter. It will resume providing fulsome guidance from the second quarter of 2018.Marriott expects comparable system-wide RevPAR to be flat to up 2% (on a constant-dollar basis) in North America and 1% to 3% worldwide. The guidance for fourth-quarter RevPAR growth in North America reflects the shift of the Easter holiday. Outside North America, the company expects the same to rise in the range of 3% to 5%.The company anticipates realizing roughly $45 million gain in the quarter, resulting from the sale of the Sheraton Buenos Aires Hotel & Convention Center and Park Tower, a Luxury Collection Hotel.2018 ViewTaking in to account the impacts of the new revenue standard, Marriott anticipates earnings in the band of $5.11 to $5.34 per share. The midpoint of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.16.Comparable system-wide RevPAR is expected to increase 1-2% in North America, 3-5% outside North America and improve 1-3% worldwide on a constant-dollar basis. While the company anticipates gross room additions of roughly 7%, room deletions are expected to lie between 1% and 1.5% for 2018.Additionally, Marriott projects fee revenues between $3,535 million and $3,620 million including $360 million to $380 million of credit card branding fees. Incentive management fees are anticipated to increase at a low-single digit rate from $607 million in 2017.While operating income is anticipated in the range of $2,590 million to $2,695 million, general, administrative and other expenses are envisioned in the $935 million to $945 million band.Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $3,315 million and $3,420 million. All figures include impact of the new revenue standard.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the hotel space include Choice Hotels (CHH  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as Intercontinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

823,MAR,"The U.S hotel industry posted a stellar performance in 2017 and experts believe that it will break more records through next year. Demand for hotel rooms is burgeoning, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing for a whopping 94 months in a row.A strong economy bolstered by record consumer spending levels was cited as the primary reason for the impressive performance. Such encouraging factors will help the hotel industry gain traction in the near future, while GOP tax cuts will spur an increase in leisure as well as hotel development. Given the positives, doubling down on the hottest hotel stocks seems judicious.Record-Breaking Growth Projected for Hotel IndustryAs per hotel research firm STR and Tourism Economics, the hotel industry is projected to see a 0.3% rise in occupancy in 2018. Average daily rate (ADR) and RevPAR are expected to rise 2.4% to $129.77 and 2.7% to $85.82. While the luxury and independent segments will witness the largest increase in occupancy this year, Independent hotels are expected to post considerable growth in ADR (+2.5%) and RevPAR (+2.9%).As per the report’s initial forecast for 2019, the hotel industry is projected to report a 0.1% increase in occupancy, 2.3% growth in ADR to $132.81 and 2.4% rise in RevPAR to $87.89.  RevPAR is expected to be the maximum at the Luxury segment.All the three key metrics are poised to scale north this year and the next as demand continues to outpace supply.Outlook2018 Forecast2019 ForecastDemand+2.3%+2.0%Supply+2.0%+1.9%(Source: STR/Tourism Economics)Needless to say, occupancy increased 0.9% last year and ADR rose 2.1% to almost $127, driving RevPAR by 3%. All the metrics surpassed projections and touched record levels, per the report. Houston, Texas, in the meantime, reported the highest spike in RevPAR, thanks to displaced residents seeking rooms due to hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Nashville, Tennessee, posted the largest rise in ADR.Stronger GDP — A Key CatalystThe hotel industry is in a solid position moving through the next year, particularly due to a stronger economy powered by record consumer spending levels. The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.The economy was driven by solid consumer spending in the fourth quarter. The main engine of the economy grew at 3.8% over the quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Consumer outlays, thus, registered the fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years. Spending, in fact, climbed 0.4% in December, notching the highest increase in household buying since 2011.Consumers are, largely, benefitting from a low unemployment level and rise in income. Jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and workers’ pay increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017 (read more: 5 Winning Stocks for Best Stretch of Growth Since '09).Tax Overhaul Policy to Benefit Hotel IndustryThe GOP tax cuts are a blessing in disguise for the hotel industry.

The tax cut will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019 (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).On an individual level, tax cuts will boost the paychecks for many workers and will result in higher discretionary income for leisure travel.

824,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) primarily banks on its strong brand presence and continual expansion for growth. By the end of the last reported quarter, the company's portfolio included 739 properties in 57 countries. Hyatt continues to expand in high-growth markets as well as underpenetrated ones with excess capacity.Toward this end, Hyatt recently announced the opening of Grand Hyatt Manila in Philippines. Located at the junction of the financial, commercial and entertainment districts of Taguig, Bonifacio Global City, the hotel offers 461 luxury rooms and is the tallest skyscraper in Philippines.Market Share Expansion, Top-Line GrowthThe recent hotel opening underscore Hyatt’s continuous efforts toward expanding its brands globally which in turn should help it increase market share. Notably, courtesy of aggressive expansion efforts, the company’s hotel opening agreements have continually outpaced actual openings and this trend is expected to continue in the near future as well. The company has experienced net room growth of between 6% and 7% for ten consecutive quarters.Further, we expect the recent launch to boost Hyatt’s Owned and Leased Hotels revenues. The performance of the segment was particularly weak in the last reported quarter. Revenues were down 2.7% year over year (down 3.2% at cc). Comparable Owned and Leased hotels RevPAR declined 0.5% (down 1.1% at cc).Countering Competition International expansion should help the company gain market share. We believe the strategy is part of Hyatt’s plan to fend off competition from the likes of Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham  and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) in international markets.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

825,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Home2 Suites by Hilton brand has opened Home2 Suites by Hilton Miramar Ft. Lauderdale.  This is the 200th property by Home2 Suites, which the company had planned to open by the end of 2017.Notably, in itsRoad to Home200, held in September, Home2 Suites had invited hotel journalists to predict which out of 385 pending locations would mark its 200th hotel. Given the rapid pace of launching new hotels, there were more than 60 locations that had chances of becoming the 200thproperty.We observe that the stock has rallied 28.8% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 11%.Brand Portfolio Expansion as Key Growth DriverThe move appears to be a part of Hilton’s efforts to gain traction in urban and suburban locations. It is expected to significantly boost the company’s brand portfolio, which already consists of 14 world-class brands, comprising more than 5,100 properties with nearly 838,000 rooms in 103 countries and territories. Moreover, the portfolio continues to spread in the domestic market.The company eyes net unit growth of approximately 6.5% for 2017 and have more rooms under construction than any other hotel chain.Home2 Suites has an innovative and flexible construction model, which has already helped the brand enter major urban centers such as Los Angeles and Downtown Columbus, Ohio. Hilton, by capitalizing on the multi-brand building model, is also expanding its urban footprint in Chicago and downtown Columbia, which have high barriers to entry.Focus on Enhancing Customer LoyaltyThe new hotel also seems to be a part of Hilton’s bid to enhance customer loyalty, more so because Home2 Suites is a part of Hilton Honors, one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 70 million members, this network has emerged a highly valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer-centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Last WordsRelentless expansion and strategic vision to fortify its presence globally as well as domestically, makes Home2 Suites a significant brand for Hilton, which is continuously gaining momentum.Additionally, Hilton maintains strong fundamentals and cash flow position, which are beneficial to its shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, the company has opted for a more capital-light operating business model backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts, as well as its timeshare business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHilton currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sectorare Marriott International, Inc.

826,MAR,"The improving economy in the United States has been favoring hospitality companies. In the next 10 years, global travel is estimated to increase at a compound rate of 7%. International trips are expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, which reflects growing demand for hotels.Leading hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) are striving to rake in profits from the competitive industry.Marriott and Hilton have a distinguished footprint across the globe along with a strong domestic presence. Marriott and its brands own more than 6,400 properties worldwide. Hilton currently has a portfolio of 14 world-class brands, comprising more than 5,100 properties with nearly 838,000 rooms in 103 countries and territories.The companies are focusing on the expansion of their global foothold and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets.Let’s find out which stock is a better pick.Price PerformanceMarriot has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date, compared with Hilton. While Marriott has returned 61.2% year to date outperforming its industry’s26.4% rally, Hilton has lost 2.7%.Estimated Earnings & RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).For the current year, Marriott’s earnings per share are expected to grow nearly 11%. Moreover, year-over-year sales growth for the current year is expected at 32.9%. However, Hilton’s current-year earnings and sales are anticipated to decline 29% and 22.1%, respectively. This provides Marriott an edge over Hilton.ValuationThe P/E ratio is considered for the evaluation of a stock. Typically, stocks with high P/E are overvalued, whereas those with low P/E are undervalued. However, this metric disregards the company's growth rate. Hence, an investor is likely to pick stocks which are trading at substantially lower PE multiples.Since we are considering two companies with different growth trajectories, price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio will provide better valuation. The PEG ratio takes into account the companies’ individual growth paths.Although the companies’ PEG ratios indicate a stretched valuation compared with the industry, Marriot is in a favorable position. While the industry’s PEG ratio is 11.3, Marriott and Hilton have a PEG of 3.4x and 8.3x, respectively.Return on EquityMarriott delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 31.6% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 6.2%. Hilton’s ROE is pegged at 27.3%. This indicates that Marriott reinvests more efficiently than its peers.Net MarginTraditionally, gross margin for hospitality companies is comparatively higher as majority of the expenses come from cost of operations. However, the sector’s profits are not very high which is evident from net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 4.6, while that for Marriott and Hilton are 6.3% and 0.3%, respectively.Clearly, Marriott’s cost savings have led to better margins whereas Hilton lags in terms of margin expansion.Final ThoughtsOur comparative analysis shows that Marriott has an edge over Hilton in terms of price movement, higher projected EPS growth, valuation, ROE and margins.Zacks Rank & Other PicksMarriott and Hilton carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Two top-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector include Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) and Clarus Corporation (CLAR  -  Free Report). While Clarus sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Choice Hotels carries a Zacks Rank #2.

828,MAR,"With ever changing market dynamics, investors are often lured into undertaking complex investment strategies. But this may not yield the desired results always. Therefore, using conventional strategies based on key fundamentals to select stocks is always a safe and sound approach for ensuring steady returns.Among several rational and down-to-earth investment strategies, we picked one that is focused on the sales growth of a company. Steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business.Flat or declining sales growth shows obstacles at the company, which will limit scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period, but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit temporarily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. So, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation. This metric’s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings.Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not desirable. A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, Marriott International, Inc.

832,MAR,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 1, after market close.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 83.93%. In fact, Mattel saw earnings misses in each of the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being 68.48%.Further, shares of the company have lost 43% in the past year, against the industry’s gain of 51.3%.Mattel, Inc. Price  Mattel, Inc. Price | Mattel, Inc. Quote Sales to Decline FurtherThe consensus estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.76 billion, reflecting a 4.2% year-over-year decline.The projected sales decline is primarily due to a challenging sales environment owing to growing demand for a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment, including video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices from companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report).Moreover, the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy aggravated matters. Mattel has been particularly affected by the bankruptcy as it resulted in a year-over-year decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues and profits. This is expected to reflect in fourth-quarter revenues as well.Also, per a recent regulatory filing, the company expects 2017 sales to decline by a percentage of at least mid-to-high single digits compared to 2016. For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects particularly weak sales as a few of its major brands have been underperforming for quite some time now. Also, the company’s key retail partners are moving toward tighter inventory management.Weak Margins to Hurt Bottom LineThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 20 cents, suggesting 61.5% year-over-year decline. Also, the company witnessed a 51.2% downward revision in earnings estimates over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ pessimism surrounding the stock.This bottom line is expected to be hurt primarily by a rise in operating expenses. We note that, even though Mattel suspended its dividend payments and adopted cost-cutting initiatives, it is expected to see a slight uptick in 2017 expenses in comparison to 2016 on a gross dollar basis. For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects year-over-year rise in operating expenses, leading to a drop in operating margin.Additionally, owing to the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy, the company’s gross margins are likely to decline in the fourth quarter. For the first nine months of 2017, net sales reversal in Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for approximately one-fifth of the year-over-year decline in total margin.The company reported a 620 basis points (bps) year-over-year decline in gross margin during the said time. This decline, led by unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption, is expected to be reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 results. A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write-downs and discounts offered to clear inventory.Finally, the company stated that its gross margin and operating income might get affected by fourth-quarter charges or expenses which include restructuring and other non-cash write-offs. These expenses could be material or incurred in connection with the company’s recent cost-savings program, targeting run-rate cost savings of at least $650 million.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a MissMattel does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Mattel has an Earnings ESP of -38.78%.

The loss reported can primarily be attributed to a non-cash charge of $420 million associated with the new tax reform.Revenues of $5,702 million rose nearly 1% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $5,656 million. However, the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,836 million. On a currency-neutral basis, sales declined of 1.6%.

Also, the operating margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) to 6.9%. During the quarter, unit volume declines and raw material inflation completely negated the gains from favorable cost productivity, product price/mix and restructuring benefits.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America remained flat with last year at $3.1 billion, while it dipped 0.8% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 bps to 11.8%. In dollar terms, operating profit grew 5.4% to $368 million.

Excluding currency translations, it increased 4.4%. Adjusted operating margin of 7.1% contracted 120 bps mainly due to raw material inflation, which was partly neutralized by cost productivity and the sale and monetization of some tax credits.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA increased 1.5% to $1.4 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it dropped 5.6%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating profit of $4 million in the fourth quarter versus adjusted operating profit of $45 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, adjusted operating margin came in at 0.3%, which fell 300 bps from the year-ago period. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix negated by favorable cost productivity and restructuring gains.Revenues from Asia declined 5.4% to $333 million from $352 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues decreased 8.3%. Moreover, the segment reported adjusted operating loss of $1 million against operating profit of $19 million in the prior-year quarter.

834,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) Hyatt Centric brand has been swiftly gaining momentum since its launch in 2015. The brand offers full-service lifestyle hotels located in prime destinations and particularly caters to millennial-minded travelers.  Recently, the brand debuted in the Asia Pacific region, with Hyatt Centric Ginza Tokyo. It is now part of its worldwide portfolio of 18 Hyatt Centric hotels.The move comes on the heels of the opening of Hyatt Centric Gran Via Madrid, the first Hyatt hotel in mainland Spain and Hyatt Centric La Rosière, the first Hyatt Centric brand hotel in France, last month. The latest additions indicate the strong potential of the brand.We observe that Hyatt shares have rallied 47.4% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 33.2% growth.Let us discuss the rationale behind the aggressive expansion strategy for the Hyatt Centric brand expansion and its prospects.International Expansion to Counter CompetitionThe strategy underscores Hyatt’s consistent efforts to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in lucrative but relatively untapped international markets. In fact, other than in Europe and Asia Pacific, the company has expansion plans for Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.  International expansion should help the company to increase its market share, thus boosting its business. We believe the strategy is also part of Hyatt’s plan to leapfrog competitors like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham  and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) in the race to expand in untapped markets.Eyeing Top-Line Growth, Leveraging on Industry OpportunitiesWe expect the expansion to boost revenues of Hyatt’s Owned and Leased Hotels segment since it includes the Hyatt Centric brand. The performance of the segment was particularly weak in the last quarter. Revenues were down 2.7% year over year (down 3.2% at constant currency). Comparable owned and leased hotels RevPAR declined 0.5% (down 1.1% at constant currency).Hyatt Hotels Corporation Revenue (TTM) Hyatt Hotels Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Hyatt Hotels Corporation QuoteNotably, with Hyatt Centric Ginza Tokyo, Hyatt seems to be gearing up to leverage on the upcoming tourism boost in Japan. The country aims to welcome around 40 million tourists annually by 2020. Tourism in the country is expected to grow around the time owing to the Olympics and Paralympics events in Tokyo.Zacks RankHyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

835,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is extremely driven toward enhancing its services through various initiatives to boost traffic and in turn sales.Toward this end, Embassy Suites by Hilton — one of the 14 leading brands of Hilton — recently announced plans to launch two bar-centric lunch and dinner offerings — Brickstones Kitchen & Bar and E'Terie Bar & Grill and Food to Go. The brand is also reimaging its food & beverage offerings.These initiatives will mark the start of a complete transformation of the brand’s food & beverage program.Shares of Hilton have rallied 37.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 32.7%.Sales-Building Plans on TrackThe recent move qualifies as one of the many sales-building initiatives that have been undertaken by Hilton. Through the addition of the lunch and dinner offerings, Hilton is trying to reach out to more guests and inspire them to stay beyond the complimentary hours for lunches and dinners.Moreover, by providing full-service dining experience and fast-casual dining in a bar-like set up, the company is trying to appeal to the contemporary tastes of a wide range of customers.In fact, the company’s latest introductions are in line with the current trend of jazzing up the food and bar offerings at many restaurants.Hilton Honors: A Traffic DriverThese initiatives are part of Hilton’s strategy to enhance customer loyalty, primarily because Embassy Suites is under Hilton Honors — one of the largest loyalty programs in the hospitality space. With about 70 million members, this network has emerged as a valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this program.The company is continuously making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer-centric by driving value for guests and the overall system. In fact, Hilton recently announced a few updates to its guest loyalty program which ensures points for all members and the option for new elite tier bonus rates.Our TakeWe believe that the latest launches will enhance the Embassy Suites brand value. In the first nine months of 2017, the brand’s overall occupancy increased 80.2% year over year.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the hotel space are InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), Marriott International, Inc.

836,MAR,"Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Jan 24, before the bell.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 1.75%. In fact, Royal Caribbean’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.15%.The cruise operator’s shares have soared 51.8% in a year’s time, significantly outperforming the industry’s 24.2% gain.Q3 HighlightsRoyal Caribbean reported earnings of $3.49, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 9.1% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenues were $2.57 billion, beating beat the consensus mark by a slight margin and increasing a meagre 0.2% year over year.The company’s Double-Double program, which is aimed at doubling 2014 earnings per share by 2017 and lift return on invested capital (ROIC) to double-digit percentages, achieved its target for the 12 months ended Sep 30.Q4 ExpectationsRoyal Caribbean’s top line is expected to be significantly driven by solid onboard revenues, strong performance of joint ventures and a decent book position.Although Caribbean bookings have recovered quickly from hurricane impacts, they are expected to stay soft in the quarter. However, strong demand for North America, Europe and China products are likely to offset hurricane impacts to a considerable degree.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.98 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.4%.In terms of bottom line, the consensus estimate for EPS stands at $1.20, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 2.4%. The likely decline will probably be the result of rising costs. Royal Caribbean expects net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up roughly 8.5%. Planned investments and revenue generating activities will further add to costs.Despite this, we expect the company to have achieved its Double-Double target. For 2017, the company now anticipates earnings in the band of $7.35 to $7.40 per share, compared with $7.35-$7.45 projected earlier. Notwithstanding the narrowed guidance, earnings in this range will ensure achievement of the Double-Double program.Our Model Suggests a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.

839,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans, extensive international exposure and attempt toward expanding beyond traditional hotel are major growth drivers.However, lingering political uncertainties in international markets pose a threat to profits.Recently, this leading global hospitality company announced third-quarter 2017 results. Adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents by 52.9%. However, earnings were down 44.7% year over year from 47 cents due to natural disasters and the Jewish Holiday timing.Net revenues of $1.12 billion rose 2.8% year over year on the back of higher management and franchise fees, increased other revenues as well as a rise in other revenues from managed properties, partially offset by lower contribution from owned and leased hotels. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 billion by more than 2%.Key Growth DriversHyatt’s strong differentiated brand portfolio and exceptional personalized service have helped the company gain traction globally through both its managed and franchised hotels.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company's portfolio included 739 properties in 57 countries under 13 premier brands.In addition to domestic lands, Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America regions. Interestingly, the company has experienced net rooms' growth between 6% and 7% for ten consecutive quarters. With plans of opening at least 60 hotels, 2017 is set be another year of record openings.Also, the company continues to rapidly expand the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands globally, reflecting its robust momentum in the fast-growing select service category.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Miraval in January has helped Hyatt expand beyond traditional hotel stays into the swiftly growing space of wellness, which goes well with high-end travelers. Though Miraval’s operations are likely to contribute meaningfully to Hyatt's overall earnings starting 2019, the initial response has been positive as well.In fact, post the Miraval acquisition, the company’s shares have rallied 28.9% to date compared with the industry’s growth of 19.6%.Moreover, Hyatt is continuously devising new plans to enhance guest experience and drive occupancy in order to survive in a tough economic environment.  In first-quarter 2017, Hyatt launched a loyalty program World of Hyatt — a platform for guest engagement. The company is witnessing higher level of guest satisfaction owing to the enhancement of its loyalty program which is helping the company gain market share and add customers.ConcernsMacroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. In the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotels and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism.Moreover, given a substantial exposure in the international markets, the company is vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates like other hotel companies including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .

840,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of The StateView Hotel in the heart of North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus. Opened in collaboration with Noble Investment Group, the upscale hotel is a part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection Hotels — a distinctive collection of passionately independent hotels.Located on the tranquil setting of the shores of Lake Raleigh, The StateView provides a supreme outdoor experience and an inventive guest experience driven by high-tech technology as well as interactive spaces.Along with 164 guest rooms and suites, the hotel also features a fully equipped business center, innovative chef-driven bar and dining experience and more than 10,000 square feet of state-of-the-art meeting and function space for the modern traveler as well as local community.The StateView is thus a crucial component in the quickly expanding Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University, which is set to house 9 million square feet of top-notch commercial, residential, laboratory and research facilities, upon completion. Notably, the new hotel opening is in line with Marriott’s consistent efforts to expand its presence in the United States as well as international markets, given a steady rise in business and leisure travel.Meanwhile, Autograph Collection flaunts more than 110 luxury lifestyle hotels in nearly 30 countries and territories.In fact, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company.

Post-acquisition, shares of the company have also soared 66.8% while the S&P 500 gained 17%.Additionally, the company believes that the linking of three industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — would lead to an even larger loyalty community. Further, investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy.However, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Notwithstanding the headwinds, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands, raises optimism in the stock.

841,MAR,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  recently announced a definitive merger agreement with La Quinta Holdings Inc. , a midscale hospitality company.La Quinta’s hotel franchise and hotel management businesses are to be bought by Wyndham for $1.95 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.Following the news, Wyndham’s stock was up 5% on Jan 18. The stock also saw an uptick in the after-hours trading session. Shares of the company have also outperformed its industry in the past year. While the stock has rallied 56.9%, the industry rose 47.2%.Details of the DealUnder the merger agreement, La Quinta’s shareholders will receive $8.40 per share in cash. Wyndham will also repay approximately $715 million cash to clear La Quinta’s debt.Prior to the closing of the acquisition, La Quinta plans to spin off its real estate assets into a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, CorePoint Lodging. Wyndham is keeping aside $240 million cash for bearing the estimated taxes to be incurred from the spin-off.Following the acquisition, the La Quinta Returns loyalty program will be combined with the Wyndham Rewards program.Synergies for WyndhamFirst, the acquisition will help Wyndham significantly improve its hotel management business and strengthen its brand presence globally. La Quinta has an asset-light, fee-for-service business structure which consists of nearly 900 managed and franchised hotels. After the acquisition, Wyndham Hotel Group can expand to 21 brands and over 9,000 hotels across 75 countries.La Quinta, being one of the largest midscale brands in the industry, will drive Wyndham Hotel Group's midscale presence and help it enter the fast-growing upper-midscale segment.Finally, Wyndham expects the deal to result in $55 million to $70 million in annual cost savings and also significantly boost revenues by the end of 2019.As it is, Wyndham Hotel Group is constantly trying to expand globally through acquisitions as the firms acquired so far have properties in Europe, North America and Latin America.Why Are Hoteliers on an Acquisition Spree?We believe that expansion through acquisitions is helping hotels consolidate and expand their presence worldwide. With intensifying competition from different sites like Airbnb or Priceline, the fusing of different hotels will lend a scale advantage to individual hoteliers. Also, companies can rake in higher profits in the competitive market by uniting their resources.Two acquisitions worth a mention in the hotel space are that of Marriott International’s (MAR  -  Free Report) buyout of Starwood in 2016 and Hyatt Hotels’ (H  -  Free Report) merger with Miraval in 2017. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group has also been carrying out steady acquisitions. The company bought Dolce Hotels and Conference Centers in 2015, Fen Hotels in 2016 and AmericInn in 2017.Our TakeWe believe the addition of La Quinta will effectively boost the Wyndham Hotel Group segment, which accounted for 23.9% of total revenues in 2016. Hotel Group revenues totaled $368 million in the last reported quarter, up 1.1% from the year-ago figure.Wyndham carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

842,MAR,"The U.S. hotel industry is set to see continued growth albeit at a decelerating pace for the rest of the year. This is premised on a rise in business and leisure travel along with higher transaction volumes on the back of an improving economy, rising employment, higher real income, and increased household net worth.Even then, peaking supply growth is expected to put pressure on pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat. Another major threat comes from home sharing companies, like Airbnb, Inc., that have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants.Thus, in order to survive in a tough economic environment, hoteliers are continuously devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy. Of these, offering loyalty programs is one of the best ways.It is to be noted that rewards’ members stay longer than nonmembers and generate more revenues for their franchisees. Also, apart from bracing against the popularity of Airbnb, hotel operators are emphasizing loyalty programs to persuade travelers to book rooms directly through their channels and limit the flow of commission dollars to online travel agents like Expedia Inc., TripAdvisor and The Priceline Group Inc.In fact, loyalty programs have started to play an essential part in determining customer preference for hotels and influence their stay frequency and spending — more than ever before. Consequently, despite the added costs associated with these programs, hoteliers are increasingly focusing on these.Top PlayersAs loyalty becomes a priority for the industry, hotels are doing away with traditional ideas and trying new strategies to lure both short and long-term business.Evidently, all the top players in the hotel space continue to make multiple enhancements to their loyalty programs to make them customer-centric. They do so to add value for guests and the overall system.Notably, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation’s  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry. Recently, Wyndham became the first hospitality company to globally expand its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties.With over 52-million members, the company expects Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit its new owner growth target of 23%. Further, the company has formed an alliance with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR  -  Free Report), which will unite two of the world’s leading hotel and casino loyalty programs.Markedly, post its acquisition of Starwood, Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) has linked industry-leading guest loyalty programs, namely Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest. It also announced the matching of member status between the programs, thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community. Loyalty programs are Marriott's most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations designed to provide a more rewarding experience to its guests.It is to be noted that Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With more than 63 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program.In fact, the company recently entered into a partnership with American Express (Amex) in a bid to boost the program’s ability to drive demand. Slated to begin in January 2018, Amex will launch and market a portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the country, which will aid in growing the program’s membership and deepen member engagement.Meanwhile, in first-quarter 2017, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) launched a new loyalty program, World of Hyatt, which replaced its Gold Passport loyalty program. Notably, World of Hyatt is a platform for guest engagement. Given these enhancements, the company expects the program to build even higher levels of guest preference and help in sustaining market share gains.Choice Hotels International, Inc.’s (CHH  -  Free Report) loyalty program, Choice Privileges, is rapidly expanding and continues to drive guest to its franchisees’ hotels. The program recently surpassed 32 million members and has already added more than 2.5 million new members this year.In fact, as per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company last week, Wyndham Rewards is touted to be the most-rewarding loyalty program in the U.S. hotel industry with an average return of 16.7% in value on every dollar spent on a room booking, followed by Marriott Rewards and Hilton Honors.While Hilton has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Wyndham, Marriott, Hyatt and Choice Hotels currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineOver the past six months, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index. While the industry has gained 22.1%, the broader index has added only 8.4%.Going forward, hoteliers need to be smart enough to capitalize on the shifting trends and adapt to new consumer expectations.Given that loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience, hoteliers must continuously reengineer these to provide a more fulfilling experience. Loyalty will follow automatically.Also, as loyalty programs offer greater flexibility and personalization, these may incentivize repeat bookings and lead to long-term revenue growth.Thus, loyalty programs are likely to play a key role in moving the industry even higher than its current position at the top 31% among the 265 Zacks industries.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

843,MAR,"We kick off another week of trading with the Dow Jones having posted nine straight up days — a new record. Positive Q2 earnings results overall (and Apple [(AAPL  -  Free Report)] in specific) and better-than-expected economic data such as last Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers (complete with an historically low 4.3% Unemployment rate) have helped moved the index of 30 blue chips to all-time highs. Can this continue?We’re not looking at quite as busy a week for econ data, or even high-profile earnings reports — although Thursday begins to final leg of earnings season, which brings the slew of publicly traded retailers to the fore with Macy’s (M) results before the bell that day. Otherwise, aside from a couple Fed presidents signaling the direction of FOMC policy ahead of its session coming up in September, and a CPI headline late this week, we begin to enter the seasonally dormant period on the trading calendar.This morning, Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a penny at $1.28 per share on revenues of $9.85 billion, which also topped expectations of $9.48 billion. These represent growth of 6% and 4.8% year over year, respectively. Also, Tyson raised full-year earnings guidance to a range of $4.95-5.05, 13% growth year over year.Anti-inflammatory treatment specialist Horizon Pharma (HZNP  -  Free Report) is climbing 14% in today’s pre-market after far surpassing the Zacks consensus of 12 cents per share in its earnings reports — 26 cents per share (accounting for stock-based compensation expenses) more than doubled expectations. Revenues of $289.5 million easily topped the $235 million anticipated. Chronic gout treatment Krystexxa grew 93% year over year, and the company upped its full-year sales guidance to over $1 billion per year.After today’s closing bell, Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) will report quarterly earnings, which follows this morning’s news that the global hotelier is teaming up with Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), whereby users of the Internet giant will be able to book hotel rooms at Marriott directly.

845,MAR,"Hospitality highflyer Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) has exhibited outstanding price performance in 2017. Year to date, the stock has returned a whopping 65.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 27.8%.Further, Marriot delivered a ROE of 31.6% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s 27.5%. This shows that the company has a more efficient profit generation and reinvestment capacity compared to peers.The third quarter earnings beat, upgraded guidance for 2017 and an encouraging view for 2018 makes us increasingly optimistic about the stock. Let’s see what the New Year holds in store for Marriot.Increased Travel Demand to Drive GrowthGlobal travel is estimated to increase at a 7% compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips are expected to top $1.8 billion by 2030. We believe that Marriott is well positioned to take advantage of the projected growth.Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in 2018.  It stands to benefit from its strong global footprint and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands.Acquisitions to Contribute SignificantlyThe Starwood acquisition completed in September 2016 is expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings by 2018, and result in annual cost savings of at least $250 million on the back of lower operating and general & administrative expenses. Marriott intends to keep expansion rate at the same level as it was before the acquisition. This will effectively mean faster growth for the Starwood brands, moving forward.Also, the company is expected to reap the benefits of increasing accountability, quality assurance, and capital investments in acquired brands such as Sheraton, W and Aloft through 2018. Notably, the company has signed 3,500 new Sheraton rooms in the last 12 months alone, with representation from all continents. The momentum is expected to continue in 2018.With the Protea Hospitality Group buyout in 2014, the company became the largest hotel company in Africa and has nearly doubled its presence in the Middle East and Africa region. We believe thae these acquisitions will help the company to carry on its strategy of expanding its portfolio worldwide through 2018. Interestingly, even with 30 brands under its portfolio, the company has not ruled out further M&A activities.Marriott International Net Income (TTM) Marriott International Net Income (TTM) | Marriott International QuoteRobust Expansion Plans Marriott plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands and anticipates gross room additions of 7% in 2018. This is likely to build economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.Also, with the increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, the company expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75% by 2018.In August 2017, the company entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba to develop a travel storefront that leverages Alibaba's digital travel platform, retail expertise, and digital payment platform, Alipay. Through 2018, we expect this joint venture to aid in capturing a greater share of the growing Chinese travel market, increase membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs.Loyalty Programs to Support Customer AcquisitionMarriott has an industry-leading guest loyalty programs – Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest. In 2018, the company aims to merge its loyalty programs into one to form an even larger loyalty community and provide a more rewarding experience to the guests.  Loyalty programs are Marriott's most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations.Asset Sale to Provide Stable Growth ProfileWe expect regular asset sale to continue through 2018, further strengthening Marriott’s financial flexibility. The sale of assets helps the company to grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. However, Marriott continues to manage the properties post sale. A higher concentration of franchise fees reduces earnings volatility and provides a more stable growth profile.Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their estimates for the company for the next year, which makes the earnings picture favorable. Over the past 60 days, nine estimates have gone up compared with one downward revision for the next year. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend higher, going from $4.70 a share 60 days ago to its current level of $4.79 for the next year.Zacks Rank and Growth ScoreThe company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B, indicating that it is an impressive choice for growth investors.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the hotels and motels space include Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International (CHH  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.Long-term earnings per share growth rate for Hilton Worldwide, Choice Hotels and Intercontinental Hotels Group is projected to be 5%, 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

846,MAR,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for MAR’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for MarriottWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of MAR, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 22.3% to 11.1%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 62.6%. Clearly, MAR is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.  Marriott International Price Marriott International Price | Marriott International QuoteFiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for MARIn addition to price performance, it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year. This can show if MAR is poised to make a run based on fundamentals, or if the company is simply moving on speculation.Over the past month, the full year earnings estimate for MAR has risen by 2.4%. On its own this is impressive, but it also beats the industry average of 0.1%. The trend is undeniably in Marriott’s favor right now, and it suggests that the momentum might be long-lasting for this stock.  MAR Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with MAR as of late.Over the past two months, eight earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that nine estimate has move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, MAR was expected to post earnings of $4.14 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $4.24 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have MAR as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of B.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep MAR on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

847,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) recently announced its plans to debut the iconic W Hotels Worldwide brand in Italy with the opening of W Rome in 2021. The hotel will be conveniently located near the famed Spanish Steps and the chic boutiques of Via Condotti.Developed by Omnam Group via a real estate fund that is managed by Kryalos SGR, W Rome will be set across two historic buildings in the vibrant Via Veneto neighborhood. Notably, Via Veneto has been the nucleus of Roman social life and the go-to destination for pleasure-seekers for decades.Along with 159 classy guest rooms and suites, including a decadent Extreme WOW suite, the hotel will also encompass the W Living Room, two vibrant restaurants, a FIT workout facility, a spa, the brand's signature Whatever/Whenever service and over 120 square meters of advanced event space. Additionally, on its expansive rooftop, W Rome plans to feature a signature destination bar.Consequently, W Rome is set to become the bustling centerpiece of the neighborhood, a must-visit location in the city and bring in a distinct social style of contemporary luxury to the Roman hospitality scene.Meanwhile, W Hotels flaunts a worldwide portfolio of 50 properties and is on track to reach 75 hotels by 2020. The latest signing of this hotel in Rome follows the rising demand of luxury travel and endorses unstoppable growth of the brand in the European region.  W Hotels presently operates seven properties in the region with 10 new hotels in the pipeline. While W Tel Aviv is likely to be launched in early 2018, W Hotels in Madrid, Belgrade and Portugal's spectacular Algarve coast are projected to open in 2019, followed by Prague and Budapest in 2020. Also, W Hotels is scheduled to mark its entry in Marbella and Edinburgh in 2021, along with Rome.Meanwhile, it is to be noted that in addition to domestic lands, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets, especially in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa.The company’s European pipeline has also grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue, going forward. By 2020, Marriott aims to expand its lead in the luxury and full-service segments in the region, have the largest portfolio in the upscale division and also win over millennials in the affordable lifestyle group.In fact, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,200 properties across 125 countries and territories, under 30 brand names. Post-acquisition, shares of the company have also soared 62.5% while the S&P 500 gained 16.2%. Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, Marriott is poised to grow in the near as well as long term. Further, investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy.In addition, the company believes that the linking of three industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — would lead to an even larger loyalty community.However, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Notwithstanding the headwinds, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands, raises optimism in the stock.

848,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is consistently trying to augment its presence worldwide. To this end, it has large-scale development plans for Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Expansion in these lucrative markets is expected to help the company gain market share in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.In-keeping with this strategy, Hyatt recently announced its plan to double the number of Hyatt hotels in Africa by opening six new hotels by 2020. Of the six, four mark the brand’s entry into new countries while two of them increase its footprint in already explored lands.Notably, the Hyatt Regency brand is anticipated to debut in Algiers, Algeria in late 2018; Douala, Cameroon in late 2020; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in the summer of 2018. The brand will also open a hotel in Arusha, Tanzania in early 2019, marking Hyatt’s third property in the country. The Hyatt Centric brand will debut in Dakar, Senegal in the summer of 2019. Meanwhile, a Park Hyatt brand hotel will open in Marrakech, Morocco in 2019, which will be the company’s third property in the country.Moreover, as part of its long-term plan to expand in Sub-Saharan Africa, Hyatt will continue looking forward to further opportunities across countries including Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.In fact, the company believes that there are significant development opportunities in Africa. Also, tourist and business travel is expected to rise with the launch of a Pan-African, visa-free passport next year along with enhanced connectivity and growth in the region’s airlines.Going forward, East Africa — one of Hyatt’s primary focus areas — is expected to largely benefit from a growing middle class, the government’s infrastructural investmentsand an escalating international recognition of the region’s stability. These contributed toward 11% growth in Sub-Saharan African tourism in 2016 itself. Further, per UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, as reported by Hyatt the first-half of 2017 witnessed a 14% rise in international arrivals in East Africa year over year, while intra-Africa travel rose nearly 13%.With the upsurge in tourism in the region, the demand for hotels is expected to improve, thereby making it an opportune time to invest in this space.However, the company could face tough competition from other hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), who are also looking to expand into these untapped markets. Lingering political uncertainty in some key operating regions and currency headwinds might also restrict revenue growth.Notably, shares of Hyatt have underperformed its industry recording a gain of 13.3%, compared with the industry’s 20.1% growth in the past six months.Nevertheless, the company is well poised to grow in the near as well as long term, given a strong developmental pipeline along with consistent brand establishment and expansion strategies.Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

850,MAR,"Leading global hospitality company, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  recently completed the buyout of Minnesota-based AmericInn hotel brand and its management company, Three Rivers Hospitality, from Northcott Hospitality.Consequently, AmericInn became a part of Wyndham Hotel Group, which is one of the three hospitality business units of Wyndham. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group currently has the highest number of hotels in the world to its name and is a leading hotel brand franchisor and hotel management services provider.We note that the latest acquisition has further bolstered the hospitality giant's footprint of more than 8,100 hotels across 79 countries and strengthened its position as a midscale segment leader in the United States. Also, Wyndham Hotel Group's portfolio of brands has now grown to 20 with the addition of AmericInn. Going forward, the company anticipates to fully integrate the brand by mid-2018.Deal DetailsThe $170 million deal, announced in July, is a huge positive for Wyndham. This is because it expands the company's North American portfolio by 200 hotels across 21 states and nearly 12,000 rooms, predominately in the Midwestern U.S., Ohio Valley, and Mountain states.Markedly, AmericInn’s U.S. pipeline currently consists of 23 hotels, reflecting ongoing expansion efforts. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group aims to take its latest brand addition from a renowned Midwestern name to a national player with potential for growth beyond U.S. borders in the long run.As a result, AmericInn owners will be allowed an access to unrivaled sales, marketing, and distribution channels. Also, guests can explore excellent vacation experiences at more than 30,000 hotels, condo-style suites and homes worldwide through the superlative Wyndham Rewards loyalty program.Meanwhile, in line with its asset-light strategy, Wyndham Hotel Group allocated Champion Hotels the rights to procure AmericInn's owned portfolio that took possession of the 10 owned hotels, simultaneously with the closing.Rationale BehindGiven the improving economic indicators in the United States, the demand for hotels has started to grow. Although the increasing supply growth is expected to limit occupancy levels, overall demand conditions in the United States is anticipated to remain positive on the back of firming group travel, going forward.In the meantime, Wyndham continues to generate room-rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments with an increase in occupancy. The strong demand witnessed over the past two years is likely to increase pricing power, moving ahead.Wyndham Hotel Group also seeks to grow its worldwide management operations and distribution system as it looks for new development opportunities and tactical brand acquisitions globally.To this end, the company completed the buyout of Fen Hotels, significantly expanding its presence in Latin America. Before that, it had acquired Dolce Hotels and Resorts, a leading provider and manager of group accommodations across seven countries in Europe and North America.Notably, the acquisition of AmericInn is expected to strengthen Wyndham Hotel Group’s existing portfolio of more than 1,500 midscale hotels as well as significantly increase its footprint in Midwestern U.S. Also, management believes that investing in the midscale segment is most opportune at the moment as the global middle class is anticipated to more than double over the next 10 years.Spin-Off of Hotel GroupOn Aug 3, 2017, Wyndham announced its plan to spin off the company's hotel business — Wyndham Hotel Group — resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018.In fact, the company believes that the spin-off of its Hotel Group business and the combination of Vacation Ownership segment with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses.Bottom LineWyndham’s shares have surged 57.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 29%.Yet, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Wyndham as well as most of the other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, we are particularly positive on the company’s prudent acquisitions, which strengthen its portfolio across all segments. This coupled with its strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans and large international exposure are expected to continue driving growth in the long haul.Furthermore, the plan to spin-off its Hotel Group segment is anticipated to increase the fit, focus and strategic flexibility of both the post spin-off companies, facilitate prospective capital raising and position them to better respond to developments in their respective markets.Currently, Wyndham carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

853,MAR,"More Americans will hit the roads or take to the skies this Thanksgiving weekend, a number that would surpass the levels of the past 12 years. Traveling by car, train or plane is in the cards, courtesy of an uptick in personal income and steady wage growth. Upbeat consumer confidence and a healthier economy are also fueling the travel boom. Lest we forget, airfares are cheap this travel season and gasoline prices are finally declining as hurricane effects wane. Thus, traveling this season won’t burn a hole in your pocket.Given this upbeat scenario, investing in travel and leisure companies will be judicious. Uptick in travel during the holiday period will certainly boost airlines, while pre-tax profits of all major airlines are already solid. Another profitable investment options are hotel and resort companies. More travel will lead to increased hotel occupancy and in turn revenue per available room.Thanksgiving Travel to Hit 12-Year HighAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), about 50.9 million travelers are expected to travel 50 miles or more, the highest since 2005. Thanksgiving travel is anticipated to increase 3.3% from last year.About 89% or 45.5 million travelers are expected to travel by car, hinting at an increase of 3.2% over the last Thanksgiving weekend. Modes of transport including cruises, trains and buses are expected to make up 1.1% of all travel this Thanksgiving, serving around 1.48 million travelers.However, 3.95 million travelers are expected to opt for flights, which is 5% higher than the year-ago level. Flights are expected to account for 9.9% of all travel this Thanksgiving.Airports to Be Busy, Pre-Tax Profits SolidThe industry trade organization for U.S. airlines, Airlines for America (A4A) sounded even more optimistic. They expect about 28.5 million passengers to take to the skies over the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday period that stretches from Nov 17 to Nov 28, up 3% from 2016. On average, additional 69,000 travelers are expected to fly each day, compared to the same period last year. The trade organization expects Nov 26 to be the busiest, with an estimated 2.88 million passengers.A4A Vice President and Chief Economist John Heimlich said that “airline passengers continue to benefit from the highly competitive air-service landscape this holiday season, as low fares and increased availability of seats continue to make air travel widely accessible.”Collectively, all major airlines including Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit and United had posted a healthy pre-tax profit of around $14.7 billion during the first nine months of this year and operating revenues for the group jumped 3.8%.Will Travel Become Expensive?Airfares are expected to fall 23% this Thanksgiving compared to the previous year. For the top 40 domestic flight routes, average airfares may come in at $157 this year, according to AAA’s Leisure Travel Index.Gasoline prices during Thanksgiving are expected to reach $2.53 a gallon. Even though this is the highest since 2014, it is far below the all-time high of $3.44 in 2012. In fact, gasoline prices are expected to drop as the effects of hurricanes and other disruptions began to wane. This possibly explains why so many Americans are willing to travel by road. As the bulk of the travel is expected to be via road, rental car giant Avis Budget is poised to be among the biggest gainers.Meanwhile, average stay in a Two Diamond Hotel will cost 5% lower this year at $117. Conversely, the cost of a Three Diamond hotel is expected to increase 14% to $176 per night. Rise in prices, however, shouldn’t be a deterrent to travelers, thanks to the increase in wages and personal income.What’s Boosting Travel This Thanksgiving?Rise in income levels is driving the travel industry. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4% from October 2016 to October 2017.Personal income, in the meanwhile, increased by $66.9 billion, or 0.4%, in September, while disposable personal income that measures the total amount of money available for use after payment of taxes rose by $73.6 billion, or 2.1%, in the third quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.5 Stocks to Ride the Thanksgiving RushWith the rise in income levels, people are willing to spend more on travel this holiday period. As travel volumes are expected to shoot up, investing in travel and leisure companies seems profitable. Increase in travel will surely lead to an uptick in demand for air tickets and hotel rooms.

854,MAR,"In the current market scenario with changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Companies are always looking for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive sales.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings at the time of assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. Therefore, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio.  Sales growth in isolation is, however, not enough. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) operates, franchises, and licenses hotels and timeshare properties. The company has expected sales growth rate of 32.9% for the current year and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report) provides commercial real estate and investment management services.

855,MAR,"Wyndham Hotel Group, one of the three business units of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation , recently announced its plans to open a dual-branded hotel in the Brickell district of Miami. This 445-room hotel will bring the company’s two brands — upper-upscale Wyndham Grand and select-service, lifestyle TRYP by Wyndham — under one banner.Owned by Brazilian developer Galwan and designed by Aquitechtonica, this latest hotel is anticipated to open in late 2019.The 41-story hotel will offer 200 rooms under Wyndham Grand and will mark the brand's fourth hotel in Florida, joining established resorts in Clearwater Beach, Orlando and Jupiter. Meanwhile, TRYP by Wyndham that will be featuring 245 rooms adds to the brands existing portfolio in Florida, which incorporates locations in Fort Lauderdale and St. Augustine.Notably, dual-branded hotels seem to be the latest trend among major hotel chains. Apart from helping the parent company to reduce costs, multiple hotel brands in one location offer tourists the access to a wide range of amenities. In fact, nearly 400 dual-branded hotels are now open or under construction in the United States. Given the benefits associated with it, the number is likely to grow at a swift pace over the next several years as tourists seek personalized experiences.Meanwhile, Miami continues to be one of the world's most desirable travel destinations with roughly 16 million visitors last year and anticipated increases for the years ahead. Consequently, making it an opportune time for Wyndham to open a dual-branded hotel in Miami.Notably, Wyndham boasts a significant presence in most of the hospitality markets in the United States and abroad. The company’s global portfolio consists of more than 8,300 hotels in 78 countries.On Aug 3, 2017, Wyndham announced its plan to spin off the company's hotel business — Wyndham Hotel Group — resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. The company believes that the spin-off of its Hotel Group business and the combination of Vacation Ownership segment with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses.In fact, this transaction is anticipated to increase the fit, focus and strategic flexibility of both the post spin-off companies, facilitate prospective capital raising and position them to better respond to developments in their respective markets.Over the past year, Wyndham’s shares have surged 47.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 27.4%. Yet, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Wyndham as well as most of the other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans and large international exposure to continue driving growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

856,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 7, after market close.Last quarter, Marriott came up with a positive earnings surprise of 12.22%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four-quarters, with an average beat of 5.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise  Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsFor the second quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 99 cents and $1.03. Notably, Marriott’s earnings have been surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently in the last 12 quarters. Given the company’s increased scale and distribution post Starwood purchase, its top-line is likely get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, should drive the bottom-line and aid in keeping up the earnings streak.Meanwhile, Marriott expects comparable system-wide revenue per available room (RevPAR) to be flat to up 2% in North America on a constant dollar basis. RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties is projected to inch up in the range of 1- 3%. Outside North America, the company expects the same to increase in the 3- 5% band. Notably, the company's RevPAR guidance for the second quarter reflects the unfavorable shift of Easter into the same period.The company also anticipates fee revenues between $820 million and $835 million. While the operating income is projected in the range of $620-$640 million, general, administrative and other expenses are projected between $220 million and $225 million.Moreover, increasing business and leisure travel on the back of improving economic indicators and positive employment numbers, along with strong transient demand might boost performance. Marriott’s rising North American business and large international exposure are also expected to drive growth in the quarter. Furthermore, investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience, which in turn is anticipated to boost occupancy.However, lingering global uncertainty in some key operating regions is likely to limit revenue growth. Also, heightened competition in the domestic market given increased supply is expected to mar second-quarter RevPAR.Additionally, the company has been witnessing fewer international guests at its U.S. hotels for the last few quarters, given the stronger dollar. This, in turn, may hurt revenues and profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Marriott this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Marriott has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.02. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marriott has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider in the Consumer Discretionary sector as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

The company is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in both domestic and international markets.Most recently, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott — announced the opening of The Ritz-Carlton, Langkawi, in Malaysia.The hotel, which includes 70 guest rooms, 15 suites and 29 villas, offers amenities like exotic dining venues, fitness centers, swimming pools and spas. Additionally, incorporating tinctures of the local culture in a modern setting, the hotel marks the company’s first resort destination in Malaysia and the second property in the country.Notably, Marriott’s aggressive expansion strategies position the company well in terms of revenue growth. The company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands, targeting net room additions of 6% in 2017. Further, the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, has made Marriott the world’s largest hotel.Moreover, given strong transient demand along with improvements in business and leisure travel, we believe Marriott is poised to grow in the near as well as long term.

860,MAR,"So far, 2017 has been welcoming for the U.S. hotel industry with moderate demand growth supporting increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Resultantly, revenue per available room (RevPAR) witnessed a rise of 3.4% and 2.7%, respectively, in the first two quarters.This is further reflected in the industry’s stock-price performance. The Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index over the past six months. While the industry gained 15.8%, the broader index has added only 7.5%.Rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth has reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. Thereby, resulting in a steady rise in business and leisure travel and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue. This, in turn, is expected to keep the momentum alive.However, peaking supply growth continues to be a meaningful downside risk and is anticipated to put pressure on pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat. Then again, the so-called “Trump Slump” in travel along with macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies might keep the hotel chain’s growth under check.Nevertheless, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing, going forward. Also, as people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, hoteliers believe that their diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand.  Overall, despite the ongoing economic and political uncertainty, economic fundamentals appear strong enough to support more modest growth in the hotel space in the short-to-medium term without any additional stimulus.Three Stocks to Bet OnGiven this scenario, we zeroed in on three stocks from the Hotels & Motels industry that are well positioned in today’s market environment and could see considerable upside, riding on the positive trends across the industry.The stocks below carry a favorable rank and can prove lucrative additions to your portfolio.Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) became the world's largest hotel company with the acquisition of Starwood. In fact, this buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run. Marriott’s rising North-American business, sizeable international exposure and an attractive brand-position are likely to continue driving growth. Its investments in technology for hotel bookings are also anticipated to improve guest experience, which in turn might boost occupancy.In the last six months, the stock has gained 17.6%. Additionally, Marriott has been seeing an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings have increased 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively.

Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive unit growth.

861,MAR,"On Sep 26, we issued an updated research report on hospitality company, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Spin-Off of Hotel Group is a PositiveOn Aug 3, 2017, Wyndham announced its plan to spin off the company's hotel business – Wyndham Hotel Group – resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018.Notably, the company believes that the spin-off of its Hotel Group business and the combination of Vacation Ownership segment with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses.In fact, this transaction is anticipated to increase the fit, focus, and strategic flexibility of the post spin-off companies, facilitate prospective capital raising and position them to better respond to developments in their respective markets.Prospects for its Other Two SegmentsWyndham derives a substantial chunk of revenues from its vacation ownership business – Wyndham Vacation Ownership (WVO) – which is one of the fastest evolving and profitable sectors in the hospitality industry.Presently, increasing the number of new owners is Wyndham’s most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines the company is making great progress as WVO brought 10% more owners into the system in 2016 and is looking to increase new owner base by 23% in 2017.After the stipulated spin-off, WVO will become the world's largest publicly traded timeshare business with a portfolio of over 220 resorts, a strong sales and marketing platform and over $2 billion in gross timeshare sales. The company will also include RCI – the world's largest timeshare exchange company – along with its U.S. Vacation Rental brands.Meanwhile, Wyndham’s Destination Network business continues to see strong growth from its Vacation Rental brands with healthy increases in organic unit count, occupancy and price. In fact, the company’s performance has been particularly strong in Europe, where the company has been investing heavily in recruiting, services and improving guest experience to drive long-term growth.Wyndham’s strong loyalty program – Wyndham Rewards – offers great prospects as well. Currently, there are about 52 million members in Wyndham Rewards, an increase of 10% over prior year. Markedly, Wyndham Rewards members stay 12% longer than nonmembers and generate 64% more in revenue to Wyndham’s franchisees.The company has also formed an alliance with Caesars Entertainment, which will unite two of the world’s leading hotel and casino loyalty programs.Thus, going forward, the company’s diversified product portfolio, strong loyalty program and effective marketing efforts are expected to sustain its growth momentum.ConcernsBringing in new owners as part of WVO expansion strategy is proving to be costly and taking more effort as reflected in the company’s decreasing Volume per Guest. Owner tour flow is also getting dampened by the company’s focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. Thus, as Wyndham starts to focus more on increasing number of owners, short-term effects on revenues and EBITDA may not be favorable.Meanwhile, a sluggish economy in Brazil, uncertainty in Africa, and macroeconomic headwinds in Venezuela and soft demand from oil-producing regions such as Texas may keep revenues under pressure. Wyndham also has a significant number of vacation rental properties in Europe, where the economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit.Additionally, major currency headwinds are affecting most of the hoteliers including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), among others. This, in turn, might restrict Wyndham’s revenue growth.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

Resultantly, net income for the company witnessed year-over-year growth of 55.3% in the first nine months of 2017 and is expected to grow further in 2017.Expenditures: The company reaffirmed its expectation for depreciation, amortization and net interest expenses for the year.

Capital expenditure guidance was also reiterated at $163-$178 million.Adjusted EBITDA: Extended Stay America expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $614 million to $618 million, up from the previous expectation of $610-$615 million. The raised guidance reflects growth rate expectation of -0.3% to 0.4%, better than the earlier range of -0.9% to -0.1%.We note that adjusted EBITDA increased 2% in the nine months of 2017 from the year-ago $482.7 million. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at 97 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 2.2%.However, through franchising of hotels and asset sales, the company expects to gain traction in the full year and return more to shareholders.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Stay America has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few-better ranked hotel companies are Marriott International, Inc.

863,MAR,"Given the improving economic indicators in the U.S., demand for hotels has started to grow. Going forward, though increasing supply growth is expected to limit occupancy levels, overall demand in the U.S. is anticipated to remain solid on the back of firming group travel.Leading hotelier, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is also undertaking various steps to cash in on this opportunity. Recently, the company unveiled its newest property – Hyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport – which is the only waterfront hotel within 10 miles of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.The 347-roomed hotel encompasses 60,000-square-feet of indoor and outdoor event spaces, a spa, and two food and beverage outlets, among other amenities. In fact, this property forms part of over 175 Hyatt Regency locations in more than 30 countries and also marks the brand’s third hotel in Seattle area.Meanwhile, it is to be noted that Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in international markets, in addition to domestic lands. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain market share in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.The company aims to continue gaining market share globally on its solid brand portfolio, and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests. Furthermore, its remodeled loyalty program as well as innovative offerings should boost occupancy.In fact, the extension of the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel stays, into the swiftly growing wellness space with the Miraval acquisition also bodes well. Going forward, the company aims to build a greater depth of proficiency in wellness and mindfulness that can be extended to the company’s hotel business.However, shares of Hyatt have underperformed the Zacks categorized Hotels & Motels industry in the last six months. While the industry has gained 12.7%, Hyatt has declined 0.4%. Additionally, earnings estimates for current quarter and current year have moved slightly down over the last two months, reflecting anxiety in analysts’ minds.Lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Hyatt as well as most of the other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc.

Also, the bottom line was up 9.6% year over year on the back of higher revenues as well as the company’s share repurchase program, partly offset by higher interest expenses.Net revenues from continuing operations were $1.2 billion and improved 4% from the prior-year quarter on the back of increased contribution from all its segments. However, the top line lagged the consensus estimate of $1.4 billion by 14.3%.Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wyndham Worldwide Corp QuoteWyndham had a great deal of benefit from the U.S. corporate tax reform on fourth-quarter earnings. The company’s various sales building initiatives like marketing campaigns and partnerships, digital experiences, website development, on-property amenities and travel perks to guests have favored earnings and revenues growth in the quarter. However, effects of the recent hurricanes lingered in the quarter, partially affecting both top and bottom lines.Shares of the company rallied 44.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 38.9%.Fourth Quarter Unit PerformancesNotably, Wyndham has been functioning through its three operating segments: Hotel Group, Destination Network (formerly known as Vacation Exchange and Rentals) and Vacation Ownership.Hotel Group revenues were $332 million, up 5% from the year-ago figure, which reflected higher franchise and royalty fees, increased pass-through marketing, reservation as well as growth in Wyndham Rewards revenues.Domestic same-store RevPAR (revenues per available room) improved 4.5%. At constant currency, global system-wide same store RevPAR increased 4.6% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $102 million primarily due to revenue increases, partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Maria on the hotel in Puerto Rico.  The Destination Network no longer includes the Company's European vacation-rentals business and has been classified as a discontinued operation.Revenues at the segment were $200 million, an increase of 5% from the year-ago figure. While exchange revenues per member rose 7%, the average number of members declined 1%. The upside in exchange revenues was favored by pricing.Adjusted EBITDA increased 23% to $48 million, reflecting cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing.Revenues at Vacation Ownership increased 4% year over year to $734 million. The uptick reflects an increase in gross VOI sales as well as higher consumer financing revenues, even though hurricanes negatively impacted VOI sales in the quarter.Gross VOI sales in the fourth quarter increased 7% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, tour flow was up 7% and volume per guest (VPG) increased 2%.Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.7% to $200 million, as higher gross VOI sales and consumer financing revenues were offset by a higher provision for loan losses.Operating HighlightsNet Income in the quarter totaled $449 million, higher than $164 million in the year-ago quarter. Total Expenses amounted to $1.1 billion in the quarter, up from $937 million in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 5% year over year to $320 million. Results primarily reflect growth in revenues, cost containment efforts, partially offset by the hurricane impacts.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, net cash from continuing operations was $880 million, compared with $846 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher net income.Total free cash flow (from continuing and discontinued operations) was $799 million in 2017, compared with $782 million in 2016. The company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $150 million during the quarter at an average price of $110.06. In 2017, the company repurchased 6.3 million shares of stock or 6% of shares outstanding, at a cost of $601 million.In the quarter, the company's Board of Directors authorized an increase in quarterly cash dividend to 66 cents from 58 cents per share.2017 ResultsFor 2017, revenues from continuing operations were $5.1 billion, reflecting 3% year-over-year growth. The upside was offset by higher year-over-year interest, depreciation and variable compensation expenses. The recent hurricanes also affected revenues.Adjusted EPS was $5.50 per share compared with $5.15 in 2016.

866,MAR,"Consumers, who are the core of all economic activity, have shown profound optimism lately as is evident from the increased consumer confidence, consumer spending and stable job scenario. Consumers’ favorable position also reflects a steady U.S. economy, which is poised for growth.The commerce department revealed that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.3% in third-quarter 2017 (second estimate), above the advance reading of 3% and up from 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter. This growth was supported by increases in consumer spending, inventory investment, business investment, and exports.Consumer spending rose 2.3% in the third quarter. Further, initial holiday period sales data (during the Thanksgiving weekend) suggests that consumers are increasingly spending on restaurants, clothing, electronics, fuel and groceries in November.Moreover, consumers’ optimism is well reflected in the Consumer Confidence data, which increased for the fifth straight month and remains at a 17-year high in November. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s reading of 126.2.A major reason for the high consumer confidence is consumers’ expectations of further improvement in labor market. Notably, the labor market remains attractive with a gradual decline in unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has gone down significantly to 4.1% in November from 4.8% in January.The uptick in the U.S. economy is well supported by the bullish run of the stock markets in 2017. Major stock indices Nasdaq Composite Index, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered year-to-date growths of 15.2%, nearly 20% and 24.3%, respectively. Not surprisingly, investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that have crushed these indices in 2017.Why Consumer Discretionary Sector?Well, spending on discretionary items which form a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector is largely dependent on consumers’ spending appetite. Given the favorable background discussed above, consumers are currently willing to spend on discretionary items like durable goods, apparel, entertainment and leisure, and automobiles.The Consumer Discretionary sector growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing. Markedly, the sector recorded 17.1% growth year to date, slightly lagging the 19.9% upside of the S&P 500. Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #9 (out of 16).Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks that have outpaced major indices, to make the best of the improving economic situation.5 Consumer Stocks that Outpaced the MarketThat said, we bring five Consumer Discretionary stocks that not only outpaced the market in 2017 but are expected to outperform in the coming years.

867,MAR,"Tru by Hilton — a new midscale innovative brand belonging to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) — recently announced plans of opening a 106-room hotel in Morrisville, NC. In collaboration with Parks Hospitality Group, the new hotel will be located in the Raleigh area at 350 Airgate Drive, in close proximity to the Raleigh-Durham Airport.Slated to be the brand’s first hotel in the state of North Carolina, Tru by Hilton Raleigh Durham Airport will provide guests with a range of amenities including a fitness center, food and beverage options and advanced technological facilities. The property will also participate in the guest loyalty program — Hilton Honors loyalty program — that serves a number of members worldwide.Tru by Hilton, with its relentless expansion effort has reached a rapid growing developmental pipeline within the hospitality industry. In fact, apart from the running four hotels, the company expects to open 10 hotels by the end of 2017. Additionally, 50 more hotels are slated for launch in 2018.Notably, Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive unit growth, taking a disproportionate share of the global hotel development activity.In January, Hilton completed the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies. On the same day, the company put the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split into effect. All these developments are expected to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, with enormous growth potential worldwide.Post the split on Jan 4, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 18.4% while the S&P 500 market gained 10%.However, macroeconomic fluctuations, unfavorable currency translations and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might dent Hilton’s top line. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company can counter the slump with aggressive expansion plans.

868,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) plans to open a dual-branded hotelin downtown Denver, bringing together two famous European-inspired brands — Le Méridien and AC Hotelsby Marriott.The development, featuring a 272-room Le Méridien Hotel and a 223-room AC Hotel by Marriott, is to be owned and managed by White Lodging Services Corporation. Located at the centre of the city’s business district and in close proximity to its art and cultural district with a few nearby sports venues, the development is a reflection of Marriott’s strong brand expansion initiative.Notably, the AC Hotel by Marriott Denver Downtown will be the brand’s first property in Denver. The hotel features amenities catering to the artistic and aesthetic preferences of the guests. Le Méridien Denver Downtown, along with its aesthetic interior, also offers exquisite restaurant and bar facilities.In addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Going forward, the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands and targets net room additions of 6% in 2017.In fact, with the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,200 properties across 125 countries and territories. Post-acquisition, shares of the company have surged 54.2% while the S&P 500 index has gained 14.9% to date, depicting the positive effects of the buyout.Moreover, with growing demand for business and leisure travel, we believe Marriott is poised to grow in the near as well as long term. Investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience too, thus boosting occupancy.However, lingering political concerns in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott as well as the other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands raise investors’ optimism in the stock.

869,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) has large-scale expansion and development plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America to gain further traction in the hospitality industry.Hyatt affiliate, Andaz recently announced the opening of Andaz Singapore, which marks the first Andaz hotel in Southeast Asia and the brand’s 17th opening.Offering 342 contemporary guestrooms, including 26 suites, Andaz Singapore is located in close proximity to the Changi Airport and Central Business District.Notably, Singapore’s tourism industry has seen solid growth in first-quarter 2017.

Thus, Singapore offers Hyatt a lot of scope for expansion.However, the company will face tough competition from hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) that are looking to tap into such markets. Lingering political uncertainties in some key operating regions and currency headwinds might also impede revenue growth.Nevertheless, the company is poised to grow on a strong developmental pipeline along with consistent brand establishment and expansion strategies.Notably, year to date, shares of Hyatt have recorded a gain of 26.6%, outperforming its industry’s 17.1%. Currently, Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

870,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) has entered into a partnership with Samsung  and Legrand to introduce IoT rooms, which is expected to enhance guest experience.Powered by Marriott's Innovation Lab at its corporate headquarters, The IoT Guestroom Lab looks for concepts to revolutionize guest experience. The features range from intuitive lighting, voice-activated room controls to virtual assistants. They also offer more efficient designs and construction.The lab provides many responsive IoT systems, devices and applications that enrich communication and optimize hotel operations. With this partnership, Marriott aims to leverage mobile and voice-enabled technology to better serve guests.  It is to be noted that in today’s world of price comparison and shared economy, hotels are pushing their boundaries via digital innovation to retain customers. Basic functionalities such as hotel check-ins, shopping and booking capability through smart apps are becoming the norm. Thus, hoteliers will now have to leverage the power of mobile phones to take on-property experience to the next level. A confluence of technologies, including faster processing power, cloud computing and IoT, is thus set to enhance the mobile channel.Introduction of this smart technology is therefore in line with Marriott’s relentless effort to enhance guest experience across 30 of the company’s brands.Also, Marriott is working toward a future where hotel owners will have a seamless, end-to-end solution with minimal equipment, and customers will enjoy unified experience by accessing their own data and information, as well as accessible voice and mobile-optimized controls. Such systems are expected to improve hotel operations and strengthen personalized service to guests.Notably, Marriott, Samsung and Legrand will be analyzing feedback to the room over the next three months to continue innovation via IoT. Customers are expected to start enjoying the benefits of this technology over the next five years.We believe Marriott’s focus on a re-imagined technology strategy and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences will continue to draw guests.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderMarriott carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

871,MAR,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) is poised to grow in the near as well as long term, given a steady rise in business and leisure travel.Last week, the company posted better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results wherein both the bottom and top lines outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, for 2017, Marriott anticipates earnings in the band of $4.22 to $4.24 per share, up from the earlier guided range of $4.06 to $4.18.We note that after the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,400 properties across 126 countries and territories, under 30 brand names.Post-acquisition of Starwood, shares of the company have surged 75.9% while the broader S&P 500 index gained 19%. After sorting out its integration challenges, Marriott’s shares are well poised to continue growing, as and when positive synergies are realized.   Additionally, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company continues to reflect strength in several areas. Therefore, it is expected to continue performing well in the quarters ahead. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key Growth DriversAttractive Brand Position, Acquisitions to Drive Growth: Marriott’s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allow it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry. Given its property locations, we believe that the company is well-poised to benefit from the increasing market demand backed by stepped-up business as well as leisure traveling in major North American and international locations.Meanwhile, with the completion of the Starwood acquisition, Marriott's distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East & Africa combined. In fact, the buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run.Interestingly, even with 30 brands under portfolio, the company has not ruled out further M&A activities. It holds about 14-15% market share in the United States and therefore has further room to grow.Robust Expansion Plans: In addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Going forward, the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. Also, it anticipates gross room additions of 7% in 2018 that is likely to continue building economics, scale and consumer preference for its brands.Outside the United States, the hotel giant is trying to expand its footprint, especially in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. In fact, Marriott’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue, going forward.Within Asia-Pacific, China promises immense growth potential despite the economic slowdown. In fact, in August 2017, the company entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba to develop a travel storefront that leverage the latter’s digital travel platform, retail expertise and digital payment platform, Alipay.Notably, China is the largest source market for outbound travel now. In fact, Chinese outbound travel is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years. As a result, Marriott expects this new joint venture to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market, increase membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs. Apart from China, the company continues to focus on other Asian countries like India, Indonesia, Thailand and Australia for further expansion.We expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Embracing Social Media and Smartphones to Build Loyalty:  Digital innovations and social media have already started playing an important role in hotel bookings. Marriott too has rolled out guestVoice to measure guest feedback, introduced SPG Mobile check-in and check-out in North America, and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings.Additionally, post its acquisition of Starwood, Marriott has linked industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — and announced the matching of member status between the programs, thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community. In fact, the company aims to merge its loyalty programs into one by 2018.These investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy.Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really!Lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Still, we believe that the company’s unmatched portfolio of lodging brands, strong global footprint along with an increased demand for travel will pave the way for its growth, going forward.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Royal Caribbean’s current year’s earnings has moved up 2.4%, reflecting nine upward revisions versus none downwards. Also, next year’s earnings estimates have inched up 2.1% on the back of nine upward revisions versus no downward revision.All these positive earnings estimate revisions testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and further adds to the optimism in the stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

872,MAR,"Online travel booking companies Priceline , Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) reported mixed results, but investors punished the shares regardless.In Priceline’s case, the company’s reported revenue and earnings of $4.43 billion and $35.22 a share, represent double digit growth from the year ago quarter and are ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While Priceline usually guides conservatively to come back and beat the lowered expectations, this time investors weren’t willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Expedia on the other hand, reported revenue and earnings that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues still managed to grow from last year. What’s worse, it lowered its EBITDA outlook for the year from 10-15% to a mid- to high-single-digit percentage rate.TripAdvisor missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line while beating on the bottom line. Earnings were below the year-ago level.When all the major players in any market produce unsatisfactory earnings reports, there’s very likely to be a common factor hitting them. In this case, it’s the hotels themselves.Hotels generally share their inventory with online travel companies to facilitate the distribution of room nights for a fee. But as they grew larger and started enjoying the benefits of scale, these OTAs charged higher and higher fees, such that smaller hotels couldn’t afford it, while larger hotels had to part with a good amount of their profits.Or at least that is what hotels are saying through the American Hotel & Lodging Association. The association is looking to lobby people in the new administration and those serving in the ITC, objecting to what they call the companies’ monopolistic business.Another gripe with hotels is the online travel agents’ refusal to pay occupancy tax, thus forcing hotels to pay.Google is also eating their lunch. The leading search engine is gaining on all fronts, first through advertising fees that companies like Expedia and Priceline pay and second, through services like Book on Google that lead customers directly to the hotel’s app or web portal.The hotel, then, offers loyalty points and other incentives to encourage customers to come directly to them instead of through an online travel agent. A recent report from Skift estimates that Google’s travel business is now worth a $100 billion, or more than Priceline.OTAs can’t afford to sit and wait until all the business is lost. So they are investing heavily in marketing. This, again, is hurting their profits.If this is a depressing picture, it luckily isn’t the only alternative for investors looking for travel exposure. And indeed, since hotels are pitted against OTAs in this battle, why not invest in hotels themselves? So here is a list of hotels that are worth investing in right now.Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report)Marriott International is the world's largest hotel company. Marriott operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts. The company's many leading brands include: Bulgari, The Ritz-Carlton® and The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, St. Regis, W, EDITION, JW Marriott, The Luxury Collection, Marriott Hotels, Westin, Le Méridien, Renaissance Hotels, Sheraton, Delta Hotels by MarriottSM, Marriott Executive Apartments, Marriott Vacation Club, Autograph Collection Hotels, Tribute Portfolio, Design Hotels, Gaylord Hotels, Courtyard, Four Points by Sheraton, SpringHill Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, AC Hotels by Marriott, Aloft, Element, Moxy Hotels and Protea Hotels by Marriott.

873,MAR,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Also, the figure improved 26.4% from combined adjusted EPS of 87 cents in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the bottom line came above management’s guided range of 96 cents to 99 cents.Notably, combined third-quarter 2016 results assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business that completed on Jan 1, 2015.Adjusted total revenues rose slightly year over year to $5.66 billion and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5 billion by 13.8%.Excluding the impact of Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business on third-quarter 2016 results, the top line in the reported quarter improved a significant 43.7% year over year. This, in turn, reflects the positive impact of Starwood acquisition on third-quarter 2017 revenues.RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter under review, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 2.1% in constant dollar (up 2.4% in actual dollars), driven by 1.1% growth in occupancy and a 0.7% rise in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came above management’s guided range of an increase of 1% to 2% on a constant dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 0.4% in constant dollars (up 0.6% in actual dollars).

Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 3.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 130 bps.Total adjusted expenses decreased 1.6% year over year to $5 billion mainly due to lower general, administrative and other expenses.General, administrative and other expenses were $201 million, down 15.2% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to general and administrative cost savings. The figure was also below management’s projected range of $215 million to $220 million.Fourth-Quarter 2017 Outlook RevisedMarriott's outlook for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 is for the combined company and does not include merger-related costs.For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are now estimated between 98 cents and $1 (earlier 96 cents to $1.05). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 is pegged higher than the guided range.Marriott expects comparable system-wide RevPAR to increase in the range of 2% to 3% on a constant dollar basis in North America and worldwide (earlier 1% to 3% rise). The guidance for fourth-quarter RevPAR growth in North America reflects the shift of the Jewish holidays in the reported quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Outside North America, the company expects the same to rise in the range of 3% to 5% (earlier increase in the 2–4% band).Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $762 million to $777 million, reflecting the negative impact of hotels previously sold.Moreover, the company anticipates fee revenues between $825 million and $835 million (earlier $804-$849 million). Operating income is projected in the range of $600 to $615 million (earlier $594-$644 million). Meanwhile, general, administrative and other expenses are expected between $240 million and $245 million (earlier $229-$234 million) due to expenses delayed from the third quarter.2017 View UpdatedFor 2017, Marriott now anticipates earnings in the band of $4.22 to $4.24 per share, up from the earlier guided range of $4.06 to $4.18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is pegged at $4.14.Comparable system-wide RevPAR is expected to rise 1-2% in North America (same as earlier), increase nearly 5% outside North America (earlier 3-5% increase) and improve 2-3% worldwide (earlier 1-3% rise), on a constant dollar basis.Additionally, Marriott projects fee revenues between $3,287 million and $3,297 million (earlier $3,245-$3,305 million). Compared to the guidance projected earlier, these fee revenue estimates reflect the outperformance in the third quarter, higher worldwide RevPAR guidance and elevated branding and relicensing fees.While operating income is anticipated in the range of $2,485 million to $2,500 million (earlier $2,420-$2,490 million), general, administrative and other expenses are expected to be in the band of $877 million to $882 million (earlier $880-$890 million).Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $3,177 million and $3,192 million (earlier $3,131-$3,201 million).

876,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has raised its share repurchase authorization. In the same press release, the company discussed the sale of Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa and, Avendra LLC.Enhancing Shareholder Value Doesn’t Indicate Lower Investment Opportunities  Hyatt’s board has approved the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million shares. Including the latest authorization, the company has approximately $864 million shares left to be repurchased under its existing repurchase authorization. It repurchased shares worth $700 million between Jan 1 and Nov 15, 2017.However, the company is not rewarding shareholders at the expense of business expansion. It has a solid cash position to explore profitable avenues too. The company continues to focus on investing in brand and sales building.In fact, recently Hyatt opened its first joint development hotel in Japan and is also set to double its Africa footprint by 2020.Asset Sale Improves Cash Position On Nov 9, Hyatt sold its 550-rommed Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa for approximately $60 million. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $17 million. Notably, this property sale was one of the six asset sales planned by the company. Also, it will remain under a long-term franchise agreement within the Hyatt system.Hyatt also received net cash proceeds of approximately $217 million in Dec 11 from the sale of Avendra to Aramark Corporation. The asset sale fetched the company approximately $20 million in equity earnings from unconsolidated hospitality ventures.We note that these sales are in line with Hyatt’s efforts to strengthen its financial flexibility and focus more on core operation. The sale of assets is helping the company grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. However, Hyatt continues to manage the properties post sale. Notably, a higher concentration of franchise fees reduces earnings volatility and provides a more stable growth profile.Additionally, asset sales are helping Hyatt in terms of strengthening its liquidity. This also allows the company to protect its current liabilities with a combination of cash and liquid assets.The strategic decisions have helped the company’s shares rally 27.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.8%. Hyatt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the industry include Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Choice Hotels International (CHH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

877,MAR,"Over time by, Valentine’s Day has become not just a special day for lovers, but a day for business too. Exchanging chocolates, precious metals and gifts to shower affection in turn brings a lot of business opportunities. This year, cupid struck Americans quite successfully if we go by data provided by the National Retail Federation (NRF). American spending on this Valentine’s Day is expected to rise 7.7% to $19.6 billion, marking the second-highest level in the survey’s 15-year history but a tad short of $19.7 billion recorded in 2016. U.S. consumers are likely to spend an average $143.56, higher than last year’s record-high of $136.57.So, it’s natural that people will start searching for innovative gift ideas for the event. In this regard, below we describe ETFs and stocks that should be admired this Valentine’s Day.Go for Candies Now and Cocoa ETFs With a Strong StomachA big share of Valentine’s Day spending is on candies, teddies, flowers, wine and champagne. As per the National Retail Federation, around 55% of people plan to spend on candies or chocolates, up from 50% last year. Candy makers will draw around $1.8 billion this year.However, this year, cocoa – the key ingredient of chocolate – is a boring bet from an investing point of view. However, as per Reuters, cocoa prices should gain strength by the end of the year, improving after two successive annual declines. Constricting supplies are the reason behind this bet. So, you can buy your valentine cocoa ETF iPath Pure Beta Cocoa ETN  with a long-term focus.In the United States – the biggest chocolate market globally – retail sales growth of chocolate candy improved at moderate pace (up 3.2% in 2017 on an annualized level). So, one can go for the final product candy and bet on confectionary products maker The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report).Leisure and Entertainment Stocks and ETFs Good BetAs many as 35.2% of the population spends on an evening out. And dining out means splurging on food and drinks and going to some exotic restaurants. The whiskey and spirits sector, a niche within the consumer discretionary space, could thus gain ahead, leaving Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey&Spirits ETF  and Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) as good picks. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 29%).Some hotels including Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation H also come under the spotlight. The stocks represent a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 40%). If you consider restaurants, one can target the likes of Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, Del Frisco's Restaurant Group Inc. DFRG and Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. RUTH. These stocks are all placed within the top-ranked Zacks industry (top 29%).Precious Metals to DazzleAs much as $4.7 billion is likely to be spent on jewelry (around 19% of total expenditure and up 9.3% year over year). With diamonds or platinum ornaments or cufflinks to take the spotlight as V-Day gifts, gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD  -  Free Report) could shine especially after the latest market selloffs. Traders may turn to ETFS Physical Platinum (PPLT  -  Free Report) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV  -  Free Report) (read: Must-Follow ETF Moves as Finally Selloffs Set In).If precious metals stay subdued on economic reasons, then investors can easily try Tiffany & Co. TIF. Tiffany & Co. retails fine jewelry as well as other branded merchandise.Discount Retailer to Save the Event As per NRF, 35% of consumers plan to shop at department stores while 32% do it at discount stores and 29% target online shopping. As a result, discount retailers like Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR and Ross Stores Inc. ROST can be nice bets for the occasion. Both belong to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 14%). With these, VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) emerge as good V-Day ETF gifts.And who can forget online retail ETF – the most important medium of shopping? In-store purchases have been hitting the brakes lately with surging demand for technologies. This makes Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) an intriguing ETF deal for Valentine’s Day (read: Holiday Sales At 6-Year High: Best Consumer ETFs & Stocks).Florists & Gift Shops Will See a Rosy Valentine Day As much as 36% of spending (worth $2 billion) will be on flowers, giving companies like 1-800 Flowers.Com Inc.

878,MAR,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 9, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.2%. Also, Norwegian Cruise Line’ssecond-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. The bottom line improved substantially on a year-over-year basis.Revenues came in at $1,344 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,309 million. Also, the top line increased 13.2% from the year-ago figure.However, this Miami-based company is likely to face turbulence in the quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including the back-to-back hurricanes have hurt travel-focused stocks including cruise line companies. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has moved down 2.7% over the last 90 days.Also, the stock has struggled of late underperforming the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry over the last six months. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line have declined 0.2%, as against the industry’s rally of 4.9%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Norwegian Cruise Line’s third-quarter results.Norwegian Cruise Line like its fellow cruise line operators — Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL  -  Free Report) and Carnival Corp (CCL  -  Free Report) — had to call off voyages and re-route ships to avoid stops at islands affected by the hurricanes. In fact, hurricane Irma forced Norwegian Cruise Line to bring back two of its Miami-based ships. The cancellations/ rerouting are likely to adversely impact the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite the headwinds, the company is expected to benefit from robust marketing initiatives and impressive booking environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger ticket revenues is pegged at $1,188 million, higher than $938 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.Notably, Norwegian Cruise Line was recently included in the S&P 500 Index. It expects earnings per share (excluding special items) of approximately $1.83 in the third quarter of 2017. Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, is projected at $455. Also, we expect the companyto provide a subdued fourth-quarter guidance due to hurricanes.What Does Our Model SayOur proven model does not show conclusively that Norwegian Cruise Linewill beat earnings in the third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Norwegian Cruise Line carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of -1.02% as the Most Accurate estimate of 2 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 per share. The negative Earnings ESP combined with the Zacks Rank leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderWith Norwegian Cruise Line likely to disappoint, investors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary space may consider Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) as our model shows that this company possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its upcoming release.Marriott International has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company will report third-quarter results on Nov 7.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

879,MAR,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Marriott Internationalis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 99 cents per share for MAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.20% heading into earnings season.Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise  Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MAR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

However, the sector’s earnings are projected to record a decline of 1.2%.Leisure Stocks in FocusThe performance of the leisure companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been impressive so far this earnings season. Notably, leisure stocks mostly perform well during spring and summer.  Among the leisure stocks that have already reported, Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report), Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report) and International Speedway Corporation (ISCA  -  Free Report) have delivered strong results, with their bottom and top lines outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let’s take a look at two key leisure stocks that are set to report their third-quarter results on Nov 7.

This, in turn, is expected to drive the bottom line and aid in keeping the earnings streak alive. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 98 cents and nearly $5 billion, respectively.Moreover, the company has been witnessing increased revenue per available room (RevPAR) in most markets around the world over the last few quarters.

Additionally, the quarter’s revenues are anticipated to improve 0.5% year over year to $2.58 billion.Meanwhile, higher-than-anticipated load factors, timing and investment in revenue-generating activities are adding to the company’s costs. Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, are also likely to be up about 4% to 4.5%. This increase in the cost metric primarily implies a year-over-year capacity reduction.

881,MAR,"A Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) brand, Marriott Marquis, recently announced the opening of its hotel in Chicago, IL.In fact, Marriott Marquis Chicago is the brand’s first property in the city and also the largest Marriott hotel to open in North America in 2017.The 1205-roomed hotel is suitably located in the burgeoning entertainment and convention district of McCormick Square. Also, the property encompasses a huge event space, several meeting rooms, a Club Lounge, a fitness facility as well as food and beverage offerings.Notably, in addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Going forward, the company also plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands.

Post-acquisition, shares of the company have surged 53.5% while the S&P 500 index gained 14.7%, depicting the positive effect of the buyout.Moreover, given strong transient demand along with improvements in business and leisure travel, we believe Marriott is poised to grow in the near as well as long term.

882,MAR,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Acquisitions to Boost GrowthMarriott continues to rely on acquisitions in order to expand its footprint. After announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company, spanning across 125 countries with more than 6,200 properties.Post-acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 48.7% since the date while the broader S&P 500 index has gained 13.4% in the same time frame.Moreover, Marriott's distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East & Africa combined with the purchase of Starwood. Also, the company believes that the deal will be accretive to cash flow and earnings by the second year following closure and result in annual cost savings of at least $250 million on the back of lower operating, and general & administrative expenses.Also, Marriott became the largest hotel company in Africa with the Protea Hospitality Group buyout in 2014. This was followed by the acquisition of Delta Hotels and Resorts brand in 2015.Interestingly, even with 30 brands under portfolio, the company has not ruled out further mergers and acquisitions activities. Holding about 14%–15% market share in the United States alone, Marriott is well-positioned to capitalize on the existing growth potential.Solid Expansion PlansMarriott’s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allow it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry. Given its property locations, we believe that the company is well poised to benefit from the increasing market demand backed by stepped up business as well as leisure traveling.Notably, in addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. Going forward, the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. In fact, it anticipates net room additions of 6% in 2017.Outside the United States, the hotel company is trying to expand its footprint, especially in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. Meanwhile, Marriott’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue, going forward.Further, it is to be noted that China is the largest source market for outbound travel now, with 700 million trips projected over the next five years. Thus, the company aims to broaden its offerings of guest amenities and services appealing to Chinese travelers in more hotels. In this regard, Marriott expects its new joint venture with Alibaba to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market, thereby growing membership of its loyalty programs and reducing distribution costs.All in all, we expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Other ProspectsDigital innovations and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in hotel bookings. Marriott too has rolled out guestVoice to measure guest feedback, introduced SPG Mobile check-in and check-out in North America, and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings.Additionally, post its Starwood acquisition, the company has linked industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — and announced the matching of member status between the programs, thus leading to an even larger loyalty community.These investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy in the long run.Most importantly, frequent share buybacks and continuous increase in quarterly dividend payments affirm the company’s optimistic outlook and growth prospects.Potential Headwinds to the Top LineDespite immense growth potential, a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region. In the Middle East, political unrest and low oil prices also continue to hurt tourism.Meanwhile, in the domestic market, the company is facing increased competition in New York due to oversupply of hotels. Furthermore, soft demand in the oil producing regions is expected to continue hurting RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room).Also in Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to remain challenging post-Brexit. Given Marriott’s considerable presence therein, this might limit its business growth. Additionally, soft economic conditions in France and terror threats in some major locations are expected to hurt revenues of the company.Marriott’s considerable international presence also makes it highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, significant currency headwinds are affecting most hotel companies across the world, including Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corp. , etc. This volatility is expected to prevail in the near term.Currently, Marriott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

News of Irma’s coming sent the timeshare and vacation stocks lower. Meanwhile, Fed’s Vice Chairman announced his plans to retire in mid-October, citing ‘personal reasons’ behind his decision.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,807.64, gaining 0.3%.

This short-term debt ceiling extension comes as a part of the Hurricane Harvey relief Bill which provides government funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed support for the package.Extension of the debt ceiling is primarily part of the agenda of the Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced that a decision to push through the Bill was reached after Trump reached an agreement with congressional leaders in a meeting at the White House.The idea to push deadline ahead by only three months was met with open criticism by members of the GOP. House Speaker Paul Ryan termed the proposition by as ""ridiculous"" and ""unworkable."" Such comments hurt the investor sentiment. The House approved almost $8 billion on Wednesday as a part of the Hurricane Harvey relief funding. However, this did not include the debt ceiling extension or provisions for government spending.Possible Fallout of Hurricane IrmaThe likelihood of a category 5 hurricane, Irma, hitting the coast of Florida this weekend has increased, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Shares of Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV  -  Free Report) and Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) declined 1.4% and 1% respectively.Energy Shares Gained MomentumEnergy shares gained on Wednesday after oil refineries resumed action on Wednesday.

Fischer plans to quit in mid-October, whereas his term would have officially ended in June next year and his term as a Fed governor would have termed in early 2020.Economists commented that Fischer’s departure would raise speculations about whether Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen would continue with her role. Moreover, market watchers would be closely watching Fed’s moves as lower than targeted levels of inflation make it difficult for the central banks to raise rates.  Investors also have a keen eye on European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting scheduled for Thursday.Economic DataFed released its Beige book report on Wednesday.

Notably, Marriott’s earnings have been surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently in the last 14 quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.33% in the trailing four quarters.Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteGiven the company’s increased scale and distribution post Starwood purchase, Marriott’s top line is likely get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, is expected to drive the bottom line and aid in keeping up the earnings streak. For the third quarter, management expects earnings per share to be in the range of 96 cents to 99 cents.Also, our proven model shows that Marriott has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the this quarter.

RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties is projected to inch up in the range of 1% to 2%. Outside North America, the company expects the same to increase in 3% to 5% band.However, lingering global uncertainty in some key operating regions is likely to limit revenue growth.

885,MAR,"Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, before the opening bell.Extended Stay had been renovating its properties over the past few quarters, which hurt its occupancy rates. However, the trend is anticipated to improve in the third quarter as the company has completed renovating all the rooms. The capital expenditures related to the same are expected to be down significantly in the quarter.Meanwhile, the transformational initiatives undertaken by the company are expected to continue aiding RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) as hotels that have already been renovated are witnessing increase in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and occupancy levels.In fact, per second-quarter conference call, management anticipates third-quarter RevPAR growth in the band of 1% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $184 million to $190 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s RevPAR growth is pegged close to 2%.However, we note that the company’s lack of exposure to emerging markets might limit its revenue growth potential. That said, the same also limits its exposure to volatile oil markets and unfavorable currency impact, which may boost results.Additionally, various sales and marketing initiatives, and limited exposure to inbound international travel are likely to drive the top line. Also, the company expects its expense containment and cost savings measures to support growth of favorable margins.However, management noted that corporate demand had been low thus far in 2017 and the same might continue into the third quarter. Nevertheless, strong demand from leisure customers primarily through online travel agencies (OTA) has been aiding in offsetting declines in corporate travel and global distribution system channels.Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s top line is pegged at $359.3 million, reflecting growth of 1.4% year over year.

In fact, the company has been able to maintain a steady flow of clients by offering tours to diverse locations and programs with greater outreach.Marriott Vacations expects to continue driving contract sales and rental revenues in the third quarter via its two major growth initiatives. The first being tours from marketing programs, namely call transfer and universal encore programs and secondly, by additional sales distributions at its new locations.In fact, in the last two quarters the company’s new distribution points have driven roughly 7 and 10 percentage points of contract sales growth in the United States. This promising performance is expected to continue into the third quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s sales is pegged at $467.2 million, reflecting an increase of 14.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the same for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.11 per share, implying a 15.6% year-over-year improvement.Nevertheless, the company’s increased marketing expenses might pressurize the third-quarter margins as the timeshare industry is extensively marketing-oriented and relies heavily on sales initiatives to attract customers.Additionally, management expects that the utilization of rental availability for preview room nights to increase tours could be a headwind to rental margins in the second half of 2017. In fact, factoring in higher preview activity and the negative impact of seasonality, rental revenues net of expenses are expected to be lower year over year in 2017.Taking into account the headwinds, our quantitative model predicts that Marriott Vacations does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Marriott Vacations has an Earnings ESP of -21.62%.

887,MAR,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marriott Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue EstimatesMarriott posted better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results wherein both the bottom line and the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.13 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 by 10.8%. Also, the figure witnessed a 34.5% increase from combined adjusted EPS of $0.84 in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the bottom line came above management’s guided range of $0.99 to $1.03.Notably, combined second-quarter 2016 results assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business that completed on Jan 1, 2015 along with some other adjustments.Total revenue almost remained flat year over year at nearly $5.80 billion but topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion by over 13%.Excluding the impact of Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business on second-quarter 2016 results, the top line in the quarter increased a significant 48.5% year over year. This, in turn, reflects the positive impact of Starwood acquisition on second-quarter 2017 revenues.RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 2.2% in constant dollar (up 1.4% in actual dollars), driven by 0.7% growth in occupancy and a 1.2% rise in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came within management’s guided range of an increase of 1% to 3% on a constant dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 0.9% in constant dollars (up 0.8% in actual dollars). Though occupancy rate declined 0.3%, ADR witnessed an increase of 1.3%. Management had expected the same to be flat to up 2% for the quarter.In constant dollar, international comparable system-wide RevPAR rose 5.8% (up 3.1% in actual dollars) in the second quarter of 2017. Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 3.1% and 1.1%, respectively. Also, the figure came above management’s guided range of a rise of 3% to 5% on a constant-dollar basis.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $834 million, up 8% year over year, from combined adjusted EBITDA in the year-ago quarter.Worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margin increased 50 basis points (bps) in the reported quarter. The uptick can be attributable to higher RevPAR and synergies from the Starwood acquisition, including procurement savings. However, North American comparable company-operated house profit margins decreased 10 bps. Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 140 bps.Total adjusted expenses decreased 1.4% year over year to $5.15 billion mainly due to lower general, administrative and other expenses.General, administrative, and other expenses were $226 million, down 8.5% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to general administrative cost savings. Notably, the figure was just above the management’s expected range of $220 million to $225 million.Third-Quarter 2017 ViewMarriott's outlook for third-quarter, fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 is for the combined company and does not include merger-related costs.For the third quarter, earnings per share are estimated between $0.96 and $0.99.    Marriott projects comparable system-wide RevPAR to be roughly flat in North America on a constant dollar basis. RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties is projected to inch up in the range of 1% to 2%. Outside North America, the company expects the same to increase in the 3% to 5% band.Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $770 to $790 million, reflecting tough comparisons caused by the Olympics and the shift in the Jewish holidays year over year. Meanwhile, the company expects fee revenues between $810 million and $825 million.

889,MAR,"Hurricane Irma has grown into a massive Category 5 storm that is now surging through the Caribbean towards Florida. Irma’s looming threat to the large tropical island area has already triggered evacuation measures and other hurricane-based precautions. The hurricane also helped to sink stocks with strong ties to the Caribbean tourism industry on Tuesday.Irma UpdateThe National Hurricane Center recently updated its assessment of Hurricane Irma and outlined details of the tropical storm’s likely path though the Caribbean.“Irma is a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane and will bring life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards to portions of the northeastern Leeward Islands beginning later today and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico beginning tomorrow,” the NHC said in a statement on Tuesday.The center also issued hurricane watches for a portion of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. Irma is set to hit these areas by Thursday and Friday.The new report also suggests that the rest of the Bahamas, Cuba, Florida, and the Keys are on watch for later this week.New #hurricane watches have been issued for the Turks & Caicos Islands, SE Bahamas & the north coast of #Haiti https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb #Irma pic.twitter.com/uJmnbDnlY3— NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) September 5, 2017“However, it is too soon to specify the timing and magnitude of the impacts,” the NHC noted. “Elsewhere, it is too early to determine what direct impact Irma might have on the continental United States.”Irma is currently belting out 180 miles winds east of Antigua with a Northwestern trajectory. The storm is expected to remain a strong Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the coming days. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for the entire state yesterday.

891,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell.The company’s third-quarter results are expected to be positively impacted by its efforts to continue gaining market share globally on its solid brand portfolio, continuous expansion, and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests.Additionally, Hyatt is focusing on utilizing third-party distribution channels such as Booking.com and Expedia more effectively by implementing new initiatives intended to increase efficiency and flexibility, besides driving demand. Meanwhile, the company’s remodeled loyalty program is likely to aid in boosting occupancy.Moreover, improved leisure and business travel demand as well as greater pricing power have been driving Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) for the last few quarters. We expect the trend to have continued in the third quarter as well.Further, our proven model shows that Hyatt has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at +3.32%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Hyatt’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Hyatt Hotels Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Hyatt Hotels Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hyatt Hotels Corporation QuoteHowever, negative currency translation is anticipated to reduce the value of overseas sales, given Hyatt’s significant international presence, thereby hurting revenues and profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, lingering global uncertainty in certain economies, particularly the Middle East and Korea, is likely to limit revenue growth. Moreover, tough business conditions and recent terror assaults in key European cities have also affected tourism. Challenging market dynamics and ongoing renovations in France are expected to continue hurting revenues of the company too.Management is also mindful of the headwinds they face with respect to close-in group bookings in the United States.In the second-quarter conference call, management stated that third-quarter 2017 is anticipated to be relatively soft due to the shift in the timing of the Jewish holidays and a tough comparison at Rio property due to last summer’s Olympics. In fact, the quarter under review was expected to be the weakest quarter in 2017, with respect to both comparable system wide RevPAR growth and absolute adjusted EBITDA.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 17 cents per share, reflecting a decrease of 63.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the same for quarterly revenues is at $1.09 billion, a 0.5% improvement over the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter too.Choice Hotels International, Inc.

893,MAR,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

894,MAR,"Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, part of Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), recently announced the opening of Sheraton Guangzhou Nansha Hotel. This property is sited in the district of Nansha, which is located in the heart of the Pearl River Delta.Further, the new hotel marks Sheraton’s second property in Guangzhou and the 13th in the Guangdong Province, accentuating the demand and popularity of Marriott's most global brand.The 291-roomed hotel offers magnificent views over Nansha and the Jiaomen River through its floor-to-ceiling windows. It also features a fitness center, a club lounge, outdoor swimming and whirlpool, 11 function rooms, and four food & beverage outlets.Conveniently located in the Guangzhou Nansha free-trade zone, the hotel is an exclusive option for leisure and corporate travelers alike. Also, Nansha is the geographical center within the Shenzhen, Hong Kong & Macao bay area, playing a key role in international trading and financial services.Being the first internationally branded hotel in Nansha, Marriott’s new propertyis expected to further support the development of the region as a trade and business hub.Capitalizing on the Demand in Asia-PacificCurrently, Marriott’s Sheraton brand has about 450 hotels in over 70 countries around the world. We note that Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. In fact, the demand for hotels in these markets is greater than in the domestic space as the rising disposable income, primarily among the middle classes, seems to boost tourism.Notably, China promises immense growth potential within the Asia-Pacific region, despite itscooling economy.To this end, the company recently entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) — the largest e-commerce platform in the world — to develop a travel storefront that leverages Alibaba's digital travel platform, retail expertise and digital payment platform, Alipay.Meanwhile, as incomes increase, China's middle class is looking toward higher quality products and elevated travel experiences.Markedly, China is the largest source market for outbound travel now. In fact, Chinese outbound travel is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years. In sync with this, the company aims to broaden its offerings of guest amenities and services for the Chinese travelers in more hotels.In fact, Marriott anticipates this new joint venture with Alibaba to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market, grow membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs. In the meantime, the company continues to focus on expanding its presence in other Asian countries like India, Indonesia, Thailand and Australia, besides China.Bottom LineAccompanied by the boost in the economy and an improvement in business as well as leisure travel, Marriott is well poised to grow in the near as well as long term. The company’s significant international exposure and an aggressive buyback strategy add to the positives.Notably, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company, spanning across 125 countries with more than 6,200 properties. Post-acquisition, shares of the company have surged 67.2% while the S&P 500 index gained 17.1%.Though headwinds persist in the form of lingering political uncertainty in key international markets and currency headwinds, Marriott is well poised to grow in the long term on the back of its continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMarriott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The shares of the company increased 4.6% as compared with the industry’s gain of 1.2%.Additionally, the company’s earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next earnings estimates have gone up 10.2% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, Hyatt’s reported earnings have beaten the consensus estimate in the four trailing quarters with an average surprise of 85.36%.Key Growth DriversThe company’s strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans, extensive international exposure and efforts to grow the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel stays are major growth drivers.Notably, in addition to domestic lands, Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America regions. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain traction in the hospitality industry.Interestingly, the company has experienced net room growth between 6% and 7% over nine consecutive quarters. With roughly 60 hotel additions expected, 2017 is set be another year of record openings.Also, the company continues to rapidly expand the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands globally, reflecting its robust momentum in the fast-growing select service category.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Miraval in January 2017 has extended Hyatt’s brand beyond traditional hotel stays into a swiftly growing space, namely, wellness, which goes well with high-end travelers. Though Miraval’s operations are likely to contribute meaningfully to Hyatt's overall earnings starting 2019, the initial response has been positive as well.Taking a cue from the Miraval acquisition, the company is increasingly focusing on private accommodations, another fast-growing travel segment. Hyatt believes that this category has the potential to add meaningfully to growth over time.Hyatt also intends to continue exploring new avenues apart from traditional hotel in order to evolve with changing tastes and preferences of guests.Meanwhile, the company is continuously devising newer plans to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy in order to survive in a tough economic environment.  In first-quarter 2017, Hyatt launched a loyalty program World of Hyatt — a platform for guest engagement. The company expects the program to attract customers and aid in sustaining its market share gains.ChallengesMacroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. In the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotels and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending as well as travel.Meanwhile, in Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after the U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Recent terror assaults in key European cities have also affected tourism. We note that this might limit Hyatt’s business growth, given its considerable presence in Europe.Given its significant international presence, Hyatt remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates, like other hotel companies including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation . In fact, the company has been witnessing a decline in international inbound travel owing to a stronger dollar.Hyatt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

896,MAR,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) continues to expand its upscale brand, Hilton Garden Inn, domestically as well as internationally.Currently, Hilton’s Garden Inn brand comprises over 740 hotels across 33 countries and territories catering to the needs of business and leisure travelers alike.In fact, the brand’s most recent round of hotel openings includes two new properties in the United States and two more across the globe.The first U.S. property is located in Louisville, KY, minutes away from downtown and near many of the city’s best attractions. This 150-roomed hotel also encompasses a fitness center, an indoor pool and a 24-hour business center. The second one is situated in Jacksonville, NC, near one of the nation’s top military training facilities. The property has 128 rooms and boasts of a 5,000-square-foot ballroom.Moreover, the two international locations include one in the center of Shangri-La, China, and another in the Kocaeli province of Turkey.Interestingly, the company is committed to grow its presence in China, going forward. This is because it is a key strategic market where Hilton boasts a robust pipeline that is double its current portfolio in ideal locations.Meanwhile, it is to be noted that all the new properties are part of the company’s industry-leading guest loyalty program - Hilton HHonors loyalty program - which serves millions of members worldwide. In fact, we expect the company’s performance to be buoyed by strong unit development and tremendous growth in its loyalty program, given its scale, size, industry-leading brands and commercial platform.Notably, in January 2017, Hilton completed the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies. On the same day, the company put into effect the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split. All these changes are anticipated to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, having enormous growth potential worldwide.Post the split on Jan 4, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 9% while the S&P 500 market recorded a gain of 8%.However, Hilton’s international presence makes it vulnerable to lingering political uncertainties and economic downturns in certain parts of the world. Meanwhile, unfavorable currency translations and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might also hurt the top line.Nevertheless, aggressive expansion policies augur well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

897,MAR,"Millions of Americans flocked to high-visibility locations on Aug 21 to catch a glimpse of the first solar eclipse in 99 years to cross the entire U.S. continent.Stock markets have historically gained momentum after such solar eclipses. Such a once-in-a-lifetime event provides great business opportunity to travel and leisure companies. This calls for investing in solid stocks from such areas.Stocks Rally on Solar EclipseLPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated that “history has shown us that since 1900, any time a total solar eclipse has been seen in the U.S., equity prices have gone up”. According to him, one year after the last 15 other total solar eclipses visible in the U.S., equity prices have gained an average of 17.2%. Stocks have, in fact, gained a whopping 39.6% after the eclipse in June 1954, while the markets rallied nearly 32% after one eclipse in June 1918.Detrick also figured out that the broader markets tend to rise an average 0.9% in the month following an eclipse, while it climbs 7.2% over the next six months. On a lighter note, he added that “it appears our biggest worry isn’t what stocks might do, but whether those glasses we bought online are officially approved by NASA!”Of course, there are other drivers that correspond with the solar calendar including robust quarterly earnings and economic conditions gaining traction at a steady pace. The Q2 earnings season has almost come to an end, with 474 S&P 500 members having reported quarterly results so far. Total earnings for these companies are up 10.6% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% surpassing the revenue mark (read more: No Shortage of Positive Retail Sector Surprises).Americans, in the meanwhile, have spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19 trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the preceding quarter (read more: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers). Here is LPL’s full breakdown of past performance, post-eclipse:Date of EclipseS&P 500 (1-Month Return)S&P 500 (6-Month Return)S&P 500 (12-Month Return)06/08/19184.9%4.5%31.8%09/10/1923-5.6%4.5%10.6%01/24/1925-0.3%10.7%29.9%06/29/19278.5%20.5%22.6%08/31/1932-3.7%-17.4%32.7%02/04/19435%11.5%10.8%07/09/1945-3.5%22.1%20.1%06/30/19545.7%22.4%39.6%10/02/19590.4%-2.9%-6.7%07/02/19635.1%13.4%23%03/07/19700.0%-7.3%11.8%07/10/1972-1.3%10.5%-2.4%02/26/19794.9%11.2%16.7%07/22/1990-9.4%-6.8%7.8%07/11/19912.7%10.8%9.9%Average0.9%7.2%17.2%% Positive53.3%73.3%86.7% Solar Eclipse Gives Public Companies Hopes of Better BusinessAs the total solar eclipse bisected the United States on Aug 21, some of the firms are expected to benefit immensely. CEO and COO Larry D. De Shon of car rental company, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) said that eclipse helped push rental prices higher. Maven, the on-demand car sharing brand from General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), had offered a $10 discount code ECLIPSE for travelers to move towards the eclipse lookout point.  And with millions of Americans hitting the road to catch a glimpse of the once-in-a-century solar eclipse, such a move will surely lift the company’s margins.Financial and bank holding company, First Interstate Bancsystem Inc (FIBK  -  Free Report) has more than 120 offices in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Wyoming and Washington. These are some of the key states that experienced the total solar eclipse and with millions flocking to these states, the bank’s business will surely get a shot in the arm.Many brands also geared up to cash in on this rare event. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL aptly named its cruise Total Eclipse, where Bonnie Tyler sang “Total Eclipse of the Heart”. And for those who haven’t traveled, Discovery Communications Inc’s DISCA Science Channel gave live eclipse coverage all through the day.Solar Eclipse a Bonanza for Airlines, HotelsAirlines have largely benefitted from this once in a lifetime event, as many traveled to large parts of the country that are typically rural regions and don’t see much tourist traffic. In fact, Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report) organized for invitation-only flights for “astronomy enthusiasts” who wanted a sighting of the eclipse in the skies. Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also earmarked certain flights that helped travelers view the eclipse from high above the clouds.CNBC’s Eric Chemi noted that hotel bookings in some parts of the country, which were mostly along the eclipse path, skyrocketed 400%. Representatives from online marketplace and hospitality service, Airbnb declared that the site logged more than 40,000 guest bookings as of Jul 31.Many hotel chains like Marriott International Inc (MAR  -  Free Report) offered packages to commuters who head to cities in the path of the eclipse. The company reported that the number of rooms booked in 16 locations was up 60% from last year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT  -  Free Report) is another firm that tried to entice customers with special offers, while InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), another large hotel chain, said last month that two of its three Nashville, Tennessee, hotels were sold out.Top 5 WinnersWith solar eclipse primarily being a boon for airlines, cruises and hotel industries, investing in fundamentally sound stocks from such areas seems prudent. We have, thus, selected five stocks from such areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy).SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), through its subsidiaries, SkyWest Airlines, Inc.

898,MAR,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

899,MAR,"With focus on augmenting its presence worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) has large scale expansion and development plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. These markets can help the company gain traction in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.In line with such expansion strategies, a Hyatt affiliate recently entered into a management agreement with ORIX Corporation to open a Hyatt Centric hotel and Hyatt House hotel in Kanazawa, Japan’s north coast in the Hokuriku region, in mid-2020.Notably, this will be Hyatt’s first joint development and the first Hyatt House hotel in Japan.Located in close proximity to the JR Kanazawa Station, the key stop on Japan’s newest bullet train route, the hotels will attract guests for both business and tourism purposes. Hyatt Centric Kanazawa will have roughly 250 guest rooms, while Hyatt House Kanazawa will offer 90 apartment-style suites suitable for extended stay. Both the hotels will provide various services and amenities catering to customers’ need and demand, allowing them to enjoy both the brands in one location.Notably, Japan aims to welcome around 40 million tourists annually by 2020. This is because the tourism industry of Japan is expected to grow around the time owing to the Olympics and Paralympics events in Tokyo. Various new projects are being undertaken by hotel developers and institutional investors in Japan as investments in hotels are likely to prove rewarding in the nation, as reported by CNBC. Thus, it is an opportune time for Hyatt to expand its presence in Japan.However, Hyatt might face tough competition from hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) that are looking to expand in these untapped markets. Lingering political uncertainties in some key operating regions and currency headwinds might also restrict revenue growth.Meanwhile, year to date, shares of Hyatt have slightly underperformed its industry — recording a gain of 11% when compared with the industry’s 12.8%.Nevertheless, the company is poised to grow on a strong developmental pipeline along with consistent brand establishment and expansion strategies.Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

900,MAR,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to expand its Hyatt Centric brand footprint in Latin America. In this regard, a Hyatt affiliate has entered into a franchise agreement with Talbot Hotels S.A. for two Hyatt Centric hotel openings in Lima, Peru, and Santiago, Chile.Notably, the hotels are anticipated to open in early 2018 and will mark the brand’s foray in Peru and Chile.Hyatt Centric San Isidro Lima will be suitably located on Avenida Basadre in the heart of the San Isidro municipality, one of the upscale localities in Lima. The 254-room hotel is likely to be surrounded by several art galleries, high-end retail boutiques along with distinguished restaurants and bars.Meanwhile, the 166-room Hyatt Centric Las Condes Santiago will be located in Santiago’s financial district. It will also be in close proximity to Apoquindo Avenue, which is a hub for restaurants, shopping centers and banks.It is to be noted that Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in international markets, in addition to domestic lands. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain market share in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.Hyatt aims to differentiate its brands by providing a distinct experience for different travelers. It further intends to continue gaining global market traction on its solid brand portfolio and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests. Furthermore, its remodeled loyalty program as well as innovative offerings should boost occupancy.Launched in 2015, the Hyatt Centric brand is swiftly gaining momentum. It is a brand of full-service lifestyle hotels located in prime destinations and particularly catering to millennial-minded travelers. These additions testify the strong potential of the brand, following the recent openings in Guatemala and Uruguay.However, shares of Hyatt have slightly underperformed the industry in the last six months. While the industry has gained 12.3%, Hyatt has recorded a gain of 8%.Moreover, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Hyatt, like other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc.

901,MAR,"Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results wherein both the bottom line and the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, the company’s shares dropped 3% in afterhours trading on Aug 7, mirroring investor concerns surrounding weak earnings guidance for third-quarter 2017.We note that on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott had completed its acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. and became the world's largest hotel company.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.13 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 by 10.8%. Also, the figure witnessed a 34.5% increase from combined adjusted EPS of 84 cents in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the bottom line came above management’s guided range of 99 cents to $1.03.Notably, combined second-quarter 2016 results assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business that completed on Jan 1, 2015 along with some other adjustments.Total revenue almost remained flat year over year at nearly $5.80 billion but topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion by over 13%.Excluding the impact of Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business on second-quarter 2016 results, the top line in the quarter increased a significant 48.5% year over year. This, in turn, reflects the positive impact of Starwood acquisition on second-quarter 2017 revenues.RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 2.2% in constant dollar (up 1.4% in actual dollars), driven by 0.7% growth in occupancy and a 1.2% rise in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came within management’s guided range of an increase of 1% to 3% on a constant dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 0.9% in constant dollars (up 0.8% in actual dollars). Though occupancy rate declined 0.3%, ADR witnessed an increase of 1.3%. Management had expected the same to be flat to up 2% for the quarter.In constant dollar, international comparable system-wide RevPAR rose 5.8% (up 3.1% in actual dollars) in the second quarter of 2017. Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 3.1% and 1.1%, respectively. Also, the figure came above management’s guided range of a rise of 3% to 5% on a constant-dollar basis.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $834 million, up 8% year over year, from combined adjusted EBITDA in the year-ago quarter.Worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margin increased 50 basis points (bps) in the reported quarter. The uptick can be attributable to higher RevPAR and synergies from the Starwood acquisition, including procurement savings. However, North American comparable company-operated house profit margins decreased 10 bps. Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 140 bps.Total adjusted expenses decreased 1.4% year over year to $5.15 billion mainly due to lower general, administrative and other expenses.General, administrative, and other expenses were $226 million, down 8.5% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to general administrative cost savings. Notably, the figure was just above the management’s expected range of $220 million to $225 million.Marriott International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marriott International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteThird-Quarter 2017 OutlookMarriott's outlook for third-quarter, fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 is for the combined company and does not include merger-related costs.For the third quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 96 cents and 99 cents. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 is pegged higher than the guided range.    Marriott projects comparable system-wide RevPAR to be roughly flat in North America on a constant dollar basis. RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties is projected to inch up in the range of 1% to 2%. Outside North America, the company expects the same to increase in the 3% to 5% band.Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $770 to $790 million, reflecting tough comparisons caused by the Olympics and the shift in the Jewish holidays year over year. Meanwhile, the company expects fee revenues between $810 million and $825 million. Operating income is projected in the range of $595 to $615 million while general, administrative and other expenses are anticipated between $215 million and $220 million.Fourth-Quarter 2017 OutlookFor the fourth quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 96 cents and $1.05.
