2,JNPR,"Juniper Networks (JNPR) stock popped Wednesday on views that the rival of Dow component Cisco Systems (CSCO) has gained traction with companies upgrading cloud data centers.Juniper's cloud computing growth is coming from customers including two other members of the Dow Jones industrial average, Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM), as well as Facebook (FB) and Oracle (ORCL), analysts say.Juniper, a maker of computer networking gear, late Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings slightly above expectations. The company has been seeking a turnaround under new Chief Executive Rami Rahim.Juniper stock shot up 6% to finish at 29.46 in the stock market today. With Wednesday's gain, Juniper stock moved into the black for 2017.Arista Networks (ANET), a member of the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, has been a market share gainer vs. Cisco.""Juniper appears to be using a similar playbook to Arista in switching — customize for webscale (customers), enter during the 100 gigabit-per-second (upgrade) migration, and ride these wins as the architecture spreads to slightly smaller accounts,"" said Jeffrey Kvaal, Jeffrey Kvaal,  an analyst at Instinet Nomura.IBD'S TAKE:  Juniper on Wednesday was added to IBD's Swing Trader, which looks for quicker, shorter-term gains, and is strict about companies that qualify for the list.

4,JNPR,"Growth-hungry Cisco Systems (CSCO) has its groove back in cybersecurity — maybe in just the nick of time.With its core network business shrinking, cybersecurity seems a good bet for Cisco, analysts say. Hacker attacks are more sophisticated and widespread, while large companies and government agencies are making digital asset security a priority.And with Cisco being the Dow component and networking giant that it is, it can grow via acquisitions — something it's never been shy about doing. The new head of Cisco's security business, David Ulevitch, came from startup OpenDNS. Cisco acquired the specialist in advanced threat detection in 2015 for $652 million.""I think of us as a very large security startup,"" Ulevitch told Investor's Business Daily in an interview. ""There are only two competitors near our size, IBM (IBM) and Symantec (SYMC). We get to leverage the Cisco customer base and sales organization. But I like to operate like a startup that's growing out into the market for the first time, with products that are extraordinarily competitive, because customers are looking for best in class.""Cisco's security revenue jumped 14% to $528 million in the January quarter, growing at roughly twice the rate of the overall market. For the computer networking giant as a whole, however, fiscal 2017 revenue is forecast to grow a paltry 1% to $48.4 billion. That figure excludes divestitures.Meanwhile, cybersecurity has room to grow, comprising only 6% of Cisco's total revenue now. Cybersecurity is one key to Cisco's shift to a software and services business model from its origins in internet routers and switches. With security and other initiatives, Cisco's goal is to grow recurring revenue from software subscriptions.In late 2016, Cisco combined its networking hardware and security businesses under David Goeckeler, a senior vice president and general manager. Cisco plans to leverage its huge networking customer base and distribution channels to sell security products.Cisco was an early leader in internet firewalls that block unauthorized traffic from entering private networks. But Cisco, along with Juniper Networks (JNPR), let its product offerings grow stale.That opened the door for Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and others that introduced next-generation firewalls better suited for handling web-based applications a decade ago.Cisco took its eye off the security market for a while but has ""woken up,"" said Jonathan Ho, a William Blair analyst who follows rivals such as Palo Alto and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP).There is one caveat, though. Corporate budgets have tightened up since 2015's spending frenzy.""Security is a dynamic market where you cannot rest on your laurels,"" Ho said. ""Their customers want to stick with them, but they weren't offering compelling products before and now they seem to be doing a much better job.""Acquisitions have jelled. The 2013 purchase of Sourcefire for $2.7 billion continues to breath new life into Cisco's network security products, making Cisco a player in next-generation firewalls. Martin Roesch, Sourcefire's founder, is still at Cisco as a vice president and chief architect for the security business group.""(Cisco) has acquired a number of private companies that help them offer a broader solution than the competition,"" Ho added. ""Customers want to buy more capabilities from a single vendor, particularly if they can integrate those solutions. That seems to be the direction Cisco is heading. And the companies they are buying are addressing more forward-looking issues like public cloud and advanced threats.""Some analysts view Cisco as a security industry consolidator that could snap up more public companies, such as Sourcefire. Acquiring Check Point or Palo Alto, for example, would double the size of Cisco's security business. But, there might be too much product overlap and integration risks, analysts say.Instead, Cisco may kick the tires at more private companies. Aside from OpenDNS, Cisco bought Lancope for $452 million in 2015 and CloudLock for $293 million last year.Cisco's investment fund has backed many security startups, including Exabeam, HyTrust, Netronome, Team8, eSentire, and Skyport Systems. As in the case of OpenDNS, Cisco sometimes acquires startups it has backed.Venture capital funding in cybersecurity jumped in 2014 and 2015 after a slew of high-profile data breaches, reaching $2.5 billion in 2014 and $3.7 billion in 2015, says CB Insights.Ulevitch says he expects a shakeout among startups. It could give Cisco an opportunity to acquire emerging security technologies at fire-sale prices.""I think we're in for a Malthusian (unsustainable) environment where all these startups have been funded but there's not enough customer dollars to satisfy them,"" he said. ""There's innovation from startups but not revenue acceleration. It'll be interesting over the next 12 to 18 months. I think you're going to see a lot of consolidation.""UBS estimates that Cisco still garners half of security revenue from firewalls and intrusion prevention appliances, though it's expanding into other security markets.By acquiring Sourcefire in 2013, Cisco obtained firewall, intrusion detection and advanced malware protection technologies.With the purchase of ThreatGrid in 2014, Cisco got ""sandboxing"" technology that executes suspicious code in an isolated environment to test if a program contains a virus or malware. Through those moves, analysts say Cisco has been gaining share vs. FireEye (FEYE) in the advanced malware protection market.Cisco also competes with Proofpoint, an email security specialist. Proofpoint's software spots malware-ridden emails before they arrive in inboxes. Cisco gained email protection tools through the 2007 acquisition of IronPort Systems.With corporate America outsourcing more information-technology department workloads to cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, many security firms have been racing to acquire cloud tools. With the CloudLock acquisition, Cisco gained cloud-access security broker software. Cloud-access security products act as a middleman between a corporate network and web applications hosted externally.Analysts say internet firewalls have become a security hub, meshing various technologies. But, one worry for Cisco is that spending on network security could slow as companies prioritize new security tools.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in an October report, said Cisco could push into identity and access management, where many private companies are active, as well as security vulnerability management. Okta (OKTA), a startup that provides access management tools that authenticate network user credentials, has filed to go public. If Cisco moves into security analytical tools, it would take on Splunk (SPLK) and others.One of Cisco's challenges, analysts say, is in winning back ""thought leadership"" in how companies should combat hackers, some of whom are state-sponsored. With its networking products installed at millions of locations, one of Cisco's strengths is visibility into global internet traffic on a daily basis.To set its security technology apart, Cisco aims to turn its switches and routers into network sensors that gather intelligence and detect threats.""We gave petabytes of data that we analyze on a daily basis, and turn into strategic effectiveness,"" Ulevitch said. He says Cisco has 300 security researchers, some working on artificial intelligence and machine learning.Vijay Bhagavath, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Cisco outlined plans at a security conference in March on using its ""Talos"" security research outfit for tracking threats across corporate networks. Cisco expects attacks that flood a website with illegitimate requests for data to increase, for example.""Cisco's moat in next-generation security is driven by scale of the company's 400,000-plus sales-channel footprint and $200 billion networking installed base,"" Bhagavath said in a report.Amid slowing revenue growth, Cisco has restructured to lower costs. In 2016, Cisco cut 5,500 positions, about 7% of its workforce.While Cisco transforms itself, it has steadily hiked dividends. Cisco stock has been trading at the highest levels since the eve of the 2008 bear market. Cisco has $70 billion in cash on its balance sheet, giving it dry powder for shareholder returns and strategic moves.After shooting past the 32 level in mid-February, Cisco shares climbed then retreated. The stock was up 0.2% Monday to 33.02.

14,JNPR,"Share-price gains by a combination of stocks with promise and stocks with solid earnings records have helped put $2.2 billion AB Discovery Growth Fund (CHCLX) among the top mutual funds.Big share-price gainers include Beigene (BGNE) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO) — both yet to post annual profits. More seasoned holdings with solid earnings include Arista Networks (ANET), Align Technology (ALGN), Grubhub (GRUB) and Copart (CPRT).Discovery Growth has joined the ranks of top mutual funds by outperforming 93% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500 in 2017. The fund has also topped 94% of its direct rivals as well as the big-cap bogey this year going into Wednesday and 90% of them along with the benchmark over the past three years.Bruce Aronow, the management team's chief investment officer, says the secret sauce for AB Discovery Growth Fund's recent outperformance has two ingredients. One is ""getting fundamentals right,"" he said. ""That means identifying faster growing companies. The other is identifying companies that can outgrow consensus expectations, that can enjoy positive earnings revisions and surprises.""This top mutual fund uses fundamental research and quantitative modeling to find the companies it wants. ""That quant model triggers off such factors as earnings revisions, momentum, earnings surprises."" The fund wants companies whose growth potential is underappreciated and that post earnings surprises that lure more investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArista makes cloud networking software and hardware. One thing that Aronow likes about Arista is that it does not have to try to make old technology solve new customer challenges. ""Our thesis is that Arista has better solutions to go after the data center market,"" Aronow said. ""It was designed from the ground up to target that, whereas legacy companies like Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have to live with legacy code and technology, which makes it tougher for them to be as nimble as Arista.""Not having to adapt old technology has many benefits, Aronow says. ""Arista's solutions are more scalable,"" he added. ""It offers orders of magnitude better economies. It's been built to focus on what the market needs. That takes some bells and whistles out of the equation. But they provide solutions that the market values.""Arista's three-year earnings per share growth rate is 49%.

Check out IBD's easy-to-read Stock Checkup page to see how Arista's traits compare to its rivals'. Align Technology is another disruptive holding. In its case, the market it has upset is the one producing orthodontic braces. ""They make Invisalign, which is different from the traditional wire and bracket (orthodontic) solution. Invisalign holds big appeal for adults, who don't want to march around with metal braces as badges of honor. So there's a growing demand from adults.""Align has strengthened its growth by learning to provide aligners for increasingly complex cases, Aronow says. It is also expanding its market by developing products for older teenagers, not just adults.About 20% of North Americans needing orthodontic devices use clear aligners, Aronow says. Invisalign has about an 85% share of that market, he adds.Aronow thinks that clear aligners' market share can at least double. And with just a roughly 10% penetration internationally, ""there's an even better runway there,"" he said.EPS went from negative 2% five quarters ago to gains of 18%, 37%, 60% and 100% in the four most recent stanzas.Takeout food ordering platform Grubhub is an example of a company that benefits from being a first mover. ""This is a classic network effect model,"" Aronow said. He added, ""The model that has the most restaurants and diners continues to grow as a competitive leader because restaurants want broad reach (to the greatest number of prospective customers) and diners want variety.""Grubhub's acquisitions and alliances reinforce its network effect. Among those announced or completed in 2017 were its purchase of Eat24 from Yelp, OrderUp and food-ordering firm Foodler and its Dash delivery service. Grubhub also entered a partnership with Groupon to bring food delivery to Groupon customers across the U.S.Grubhub also agreed to integrate online ordering from all of its restaurants onto Yelp's platform and to make Grubhub the exclusive food-delivery provider for Yelp visitors in exchange for a referral transaction fee.And in February of this year, Yum! Brands said it would buy a 3% stake in Grubhub. Grubhub also said it would provide KFC and Taco Bell with online ordering, pickup and delivery services at their U.S. restaurants.Copart auctions off vehicles that have been declared total losses by insurers. Their inventory is up because more drivers are distracted by smartphones and because repair costs have soared. ""As vehicles have more sophisticated content in the form of sensors and electronics, the cost to repair more vehicles gets increasingly hard to justify,"" Aronow said.Copart share prices have not been hurt badly in the broad market's recent sell-off. Its shares are up about 68% in the past 12 months.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Hot Stocks Light A Fire Under AB Discovery GrowthYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

23,JNPR,"Cisco Systems' (CSCO) push into the security market could be one reason for woes at Palo Alto Networks (PANW), whose stock plunged Wednesday after the company late Tuesday reported fiscal second-quarter revenue, billings and guidance all below street expectations.Palo Alto Networks stock tumbled more than 24% to 115.21 on the stock market today, hitting an eight-month low and echoing a severe drop on Nov. 22  that came after fiscal Q1 revenue and billings missed expectations. While Palo Alto management attributed the Q2 miss to sales execution issues and a pause in spending ahead of the new product launch, analysts say increased competition from Cisco could also be a factor.For its second quarter ended Jan. 28, Cisco said security revenue rose 14% to $528 million. Palo Alto late Tuesday said fiscal second-quarter revenue rose 26% to $422.6 million, missing consensus estimates of $429.6 million.""Management cited execution issues as opposed to competitive challenges,"" Baird analyst Jayson Noland said in a report to clients.

29,JNPR,"Without its stellar group of ""cloud titan"" customers, network gear maker Arista Networks' (ANET) rise in the data center switching market vs. goliath Cisco Systems (CSCO) might never have happened.Now it's poised to make an even stronger move in the market, provided it can hang on to those customers, the likes of which include Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), eBay (EBAY)  and Yahoo (YHOO).These tech behemoths all buy speedy network switches and software for use in data centers that provide cloud computing services from Arista, even though industry leader Cisco now holds nearly 60% of the data center-switching market. Many of those companies will rely on Arista more as they crave faster network speeds to whisk content and apps to mobile devices or, in Netflix's case, stream high-quality video.While some of Arista's blue-chip clients are now developing their own switching hardware, a development that has some analysts worried, others say Arista's software expertise gives it an edge as the market evolves.""Arista is gaining share by focusing on the needs of a very demanding set of data center customers. They have a big presence with (web) hyperscalers, the cloud titans,"" said Brad Casemore, an analyst at research firm IDC.Arista had about 8.4% of the market in slower Ethernet switching in 2015, but its share is double that in higher-speed 40- and 100-gigabit sectors. Consequently, Arista's share of the overall market is close to 10%, Casemore estimates. IDC expects demand for 40- and 100-gigabit switches to boom through 2020 and for Arista to grow along with that.It's all helped Arista see its revenue jump 35% in the first nine months of 2016 to $801 million. Its stock has nearly doubled since reaching a low in early February. But shares dipped 1.4% to 93.14 Monday after a judge ruled that the company had infringed on patents held by Cisco.When it was founded in 2004, Arista first went after banks that needed high-speed switching for equities trading. Four years later, it began focusing on cloud data centers, says Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal.""When we spotted the cloud opportunity we were almost too early for it,"" Ullal told IBD in an interview. ""What we saw was the rise of cloud companies, the proliferation of mobile devices and new cloud applications that were very different than enterprise applications, very distributed, and that required a network that could aggregate information in a real-time fashion.""Arista's Ethernet switches speed up communications between computer servers packed into the data centers, and interconnect racks of servers in different buildings so they behave like one data center. While Arista has feasted on cloud networking, some of its internet customers — notably Facebook — have been developing their own data center technology.Facebook and Google have pioneered open-source software concepts in data centers. They lowered data center costs by running software on so-called ""white-box"" servers, built by lesser-known suppliers from Asia.One worry is that cloud builders may use contract manufacturers to make their own network switches — basically servers with built-in, high-speed communications functions — at the expense of Arista, Cisco and other suppliers. Ullal says Arista isn't worried about the white box trend.""We're a software company,"" she said. ""We could run on anybody's white box if customers wanted it. We don't view what Facebook or other companies do as a threat, we see it as an opportunity and as collaboration.""Some analysts aren't so sure. When Facebook, Arista's second-biggest customer behind Microsoft, in November announced ""Backpack,"" its first 100-gigabit switch, it set off alarm bells among industry watchers at Goldman Sachs.""Facebook believes it now has a full road-map to building a data center,"" a report from the investment bank said. ""We view these developments as a long-term negative for data center switching vendors Arista, Cisco, and Juniper (Networks) (JNPR).""IDC says original design manufacturer, or ODM, switch makers — contract manufacturers of white-box switches — had 12.3% of the 100-gigabit data center market in 2015, third in market share behind Cisco and Arista. Players in that market include Cumulus, Pluribus Networks, and Big Switch.Peter Christy, an analyst at 451 Research, says it's a ""fact of life"" that Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook design and engineer their own massive data centers. Microsoft is less focused on white-box switch replacement, analysts say.""They have unique networks,"" Christy told IBD. ""It's a real problem for the switching industry that the highest growth segment is increasingly being (sourced) internally.""But Mark Moskowitz, analyst at Barclays, says worries over Facebook's switching venture and those of others may be overblown.""While cloud service providers from time-to-time experiment with homegrown switching applications, such initiatives are not to fully displace the merchant suppliers,"" Moskowitz said in a report. ""In certain cases, these homegrown efforts are designed to influence the technology road maps of the merchant suppliers.""Citigroup analyst Stanley Kovler said in a report that Arista's risk of market share loss due to the white-box trend is ""negligible as Arista's products are primarily in the core, complex part of the data center.""IBD'S TAKE: Arista shares broke out above 90 in late November and have reached new all-time highs in several sessions since then. The company is at the top of the class among networking companies in performance. For a stock checkup on Arista, check here.IDC's Casemore says the white box trend as well as competition from China-based Huawei in switching are reasons why Arista is pushing into the $13 billion network router market, taking on Cisco and Juniper. Routers whisk data from data centers across the internet. Arista is using a new Broadcom chip called ""Jericho"" in router products, now in trials.Arista, which has over 4,000 switching customers, aims to have over 100 routing customers by mid-2017. Morgan Stanley, in a report, estimates that Arista could garner $200 million to $300 million in revenue from router products by 2020.""Network design is changing. It's getting more difficult to distinguish switching from routing,"" Ullal said. ""This is a natural opportunity for us, but it's not going to happen overnight.""Arista, which raised $226 million in its 2014 initial public offering, now is on track to easily top $1 billion in 2016 sales. Barclay's Moskowitz says it could hit $2 billion by 2020 based on share gains in the data center switching market alone.Aside from its push into the routing market, Arista aims to target the corporate market through a new alliance with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). And, it aims to grow revenue from government customers as well.Family trusts formed by co-founders Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton hold about 27% of outstanding shares, while Arista's top 10 shareholders own nearly 67% of the company's float, says Thomson Reuters.To keep its edge, Arista Networks has been spending 20% to 22% of sales on research and development.""Networking has been written off as being mature, but Arista is redefining networking for our customers,"" Ullal said. ""The company was really built by engineers for engineers.""

30,JNPR,"Cloud software vendor Coupa Software (COUP) has been unable to live up the promise of its huge stock market debut in October. The maker of a cloud-based software platform designed to help companies manage spending, cut costs and boost profitability priced its shares at $18 and rose as high at 41.61 on Oct. 6.

32,JNPR,"Juniper Networks' (JNPR) turnaround hit a rough patch Thursday as the company pre-announced third-quarter earnings below consensus estimates, a surprise that one analyst attributed to weakness at customer Amazon.com (AMZN).XA rival of Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks has been seeking a turnaround under its new chief executive, Rami Rahim. It has aimed to sell more networking gear to cloud-computing providers such as Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL). Its biggest customers have been telecom companies, such as AT&T (T).Juniper, in a release late Wednesday, blamed the disappointing outlook on ""lower than expected revenue in our cloud vertical."" Amazon Web Services is the cloud unit of e-commerce giant Amazon.""The (third-quarter) miss could suggest lumpiness at AWS, which we believe was Juniper's first 10% customer in several years,"" Steven Milunovich, a UBS analyst in a report.

Shares in Arista, also ranked No. 6 in the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, jumped 3.7% to close at 188.49 on the stock market today.""We see at least $8 in earnings power run-rate by fiscal 2020,"" said Faucette in a report.""Our new price target is 40 times 2018 EPS, which is a premium to large-cap hardware and software companies on an earnings growth basis,"" he added. ""We think the premium is warranted given Arista's fast growth, much better-than-industry margins, plus important optionality from its Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) partnership and an eventual entry into the campus (enterprise) networking market.""A fierce rival of Cisco and Juniper Networks (JNPR), Arista sells network switches that speed up communications among racks of computer servers packed into data centers.

35,JNPR,"Could cybersecurity specialist Palo Alto Networks (PANW) join Symantec (SYMC) in making acquisitions that reshape the market? At least one analyst thinks so.XAs it laid out its vision for how the computer security market will evolve at an analysts meeting in New York on Wednesday, Palo Alto updated its product strategy but made no major changes to guidance or long-term targets. But Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says Palo Alto may look to boost growth with a big acquisition.""We expect the company to propel itself into the future via a significant acquisition, perhaps by rounding out its visibility feature set with a target such as ForeScout, Gigamon (GIMO), or even Tanium,"" Zelnick said in a note to clients.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Symantec also purchased LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion. Symantec recently has been eyeing Splunk (SPLK), according to a Bloomberg report.Palo Alto competes in the corporate security firewall market vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Fortinet (FTNT). Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from entering a private network and monitor web-based applications.One view is that Palo Alto's share gains vs. those of Cisco and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have slowed. Palo Alto has partnered with Proofpoint (PFPT), Splunk and Tanium in some security areas.Some analysts say that the security industry's bigger incumbents could target privately held companies, such as Zscalar, before a new wave of initial public offerings.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8.

Palo Alto stock is down 14% from early November 2016.Andrew Nowinski, a Piper Jaffray analyst maintains an overweight rating on Palo Alto with a price target of 155 following the investor day.""Palo Alto has a large opportunity to cross-sell additional products within the installed base, as Palo Alto is only capturing 10-15% of the installed base's current security wallet share,"" he said in a report.

43,JNPR,"Starbucks' (SBUX) top bean, Howard Schultz, is relinquishing the position of chief exec come April and will focus on the coffee giant's premium retail efforts as executive chairman. In his stead will be current COO Kevin Johnson, a former Juniper Networks (JNPR) CEO and Microsoft (MSFT) vet who has been with the company since 2009.So what can coffee lovers and investors expect from the changes at the top?Some Wall Street pros mourned the loss of Schultz, who spent most of the last three decades at a company that is now a household name. Synonymous with coffee and often skewered as a yuppie staple, Starbucks has, under his tenure, become a pop cultural icon of middle-class aspiration.""In our coverage, we may not ever again follow a CEO with his combination of merchandising genius, energy, strategic thinking, and inspirational leadership,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called Schultz ""without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world."" She has an outperform rating on the stock.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks has been a market laggard over the past year. But if you have an appetite for restaurant stocks, here are several eateries that are in or near buy range. Starbucks' advances on the tech front have put it far ahead of restaurant peers. The restaurant has cultivated a solid loyalty program and a mobile payment function that as of the most recently reported quarter accounted for 25% of all transactions.Shares fell 2.2 to 57.21 on the stock market today in response to the CEO shuffle. Starbucks stock has retaken its 200-day moving average recently, but has been lagging the overall market for more than a year.But the leadership transition is not wholly unexpected, and not unwelcome. Herzog says it's been in the works for years.""Importantly Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course,"" she wrote.RBC's Palmer says the shift is occurring ""during a period of strength.""Broadly, analysts don't appear to expect a huge shake-up from the change.And stockwise, the move presents ""more of a buying opportunity than reason to run away,"" headlined a report from Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis, who believes that Schultz will still be very involved in the business and that Johnson is ""well qualified to step into the CEO role.""Other issues, in Zolidis' view, weigh on the stock. He sees a slowdown in U.S. same-store sales and ""modest downside risk to earnings.""Last month, Starbucks reported slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but issued somewhat cautious profit guidance for 2017. The company now seems to be looking to China as an area with the greatest growth opportunities.The stock has been on an upswing since then, however, going into management's investor day coming up on Wednesday.Starbucks in recent years has outpaced competitors at home, including McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN).But Dunkin' Brands earnings growth has picked up in recent quarters, with its Dunkin' Donuts chain expanding in California.

It said much of the growth has gone to Amazon's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure and Office365 cloud services.""The revenue trends here are robust as ever, which lends confidence to our view that capital expenditures will continue to expand,"" Nomura said in a research report. Amazon and Microsoft ""account for a material percentage of the growth of traditional IT hardware spending,"" Nomura said.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft has been riding high since it reported better-than-expected September-quarter results, boosted by its cloud offerings. Amazon is the leader in web services, with sales last year topping $10 billion, putting it in prime position to benefit from the accelerated use of cloud services.Nomura said it surveyed 50 global chief information officers in early October to gauge their spending priorities. Cloud computing is a driver for 70% of CIOs, while software-defined data centers drive 34%. These figures are up from 52% and 14%, respectively, in the October 2015 survey.Among the big beneficiaries of the cloud spending is Arista Networks (ANET), Nomura said. It expects Arista to maintain its rapid growth as it gains share in the hot data-center switching market.Another beneficiary is fiber-optic company Ciena (CIEN). Ciena's optical technology ""targets the data-center interconnect market directly and, thus, ought to boost Ciena's mix of data-center revenue,"" Nomura said.Other beneficiaries are Infinera (INFN), Broadcom (AVGO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).The survey said CIOs now expect 65% of 2018 workloads to be in the cloud, up from 57% in its March survey. This compares with 48% of workloads in the cloud in 2016.

46,JNPR,"Caught amid a product transition and tough competition from Acacia Communications (ACIA) and others, shares of fiber-optic component maker Infinera (INFN) have plummeted from 25 to 9 in the past year, and last month it said Q3 will be bad.Yet, on Monday investment bank Needham maintained a strong buy rating on Infinera stock. How's that?""... we still believe it has the best PIC (photonic integrated circuit) in the industry ... ,"" wrote Needham analyst Alex Henderson in his research report. ""We strongly believe INFN will ultimately be one of the two long-term winners in the optical systems market, along with Ciena (CIEN).""Infinera sells products to telecom and communications providers designed to speed networks and data centers and lower costs. Already hurting, Infinera stock plunged 34% on July 28, to a 27-month low of 8.20, after it posted a Q2 beat but gave such poor guidance that some analysts were shocked. Ciena stock fell 5% that day, and several other fiber stocks also fell.Infinera closed up 0.55% at 9.09 on the stock market today.Henderson, though, says Infinera stock oversold, though guidance was not in the ballpark of expectations. Jefferies analyst George Notter called the guidance ""nothing short of disastrous.""Infinera guided to sales of $185 million at the midpoint of its range, and EPS ex items of break-even, where analysts had modeled $273 million and 22 cents. That earned the company a bevy of downgrades, and on Aug. 8 Zacks called the stock a ""strong sell.""At Needham, though, Infinera is one of just five companies with strong buy ratings, out of about 100 companies that it rates. But Needham, too, has lowered its financial estimates, and Henderson says the company faces a tough 12- to 18-month turnaround.Infinera is hurting one of the top-performing IBD industry groups, Telcom-Fiber Optics, which ranks No. 3 out of 197, up from No. 63 just eight weeks ago. Highflying May IPO Acacia -- its shares have quadrupled -- is one reason for the group's rise.IBD'S TAKE: A strong industry group, naturally enough, generally houses some strong stocks, so it's a good idea to keep on top of top-performing groups. The optics group was among those recently highlighted in the IBD Industry Themes column.""Infinera lauded strong execution by Acacia and stated they had been 'schooled on turnaround time on DSPs (digital signal processors) and on power management.'

""Infinera also argued that the cost of using Acacia made it difficult for Acacia's customers to compete on price.""Henderson said Infinera said it will ""price aggressively"" to compete, which will hurt earnings and have an impact on rivals, though he said Ciena is better insulated against this price competition than is Infinera. He said the price competition will affect rivals such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).Other top rivals include non-U.S. companies such as Hauwei and Alcatel-Lucent, where much of the price competition will take place. Meanwhile, Henderson said Infinera much launch its next-generation PIC and start selling it into the key DCI, or data center interconnect, market.RELATED:Acacia CEO Weighs In On Fiber-Optics 'Super Cycle'

48,JNPR,"Industry group strength is like an afterburner for a top-rated company. It supplies that extra boost for a stock that's already moving on great fundamentals and technicals.Looking at shorter time frames for the group performance can give you an edge on emerging trends, and is especially useful in swing trades.IBD tracks performance for 197 industry groups. Each stock is placed in a group according to what part of its business provides the majority of its revenue. Apple (AAPL) for example, used to be in the computer manufacturing group and now, thanks to the iPhone, it belongs to the telecommunications consumer products group.What do you do with the information? Knowing which groups are performing best gives you a good indication of where to look for prospects. IBD ranks each industry group by its six-month performance. MarketSmith, a premium service offered by IBD, allows you to also sort groups by three-month performance to get an idea of power on a shorter time frame and provides all the components of each group as well.Looking at the computer networking industry group, it was ranked No. 81 out of 197 industry groups 13 weeks ago and made it to the top 10 nearly two months ago. MarketSmith currently shows it as No. 9 in three-month performance with a group move of 15% in that time frame.An industry rise like that means you may find a number of names extended, so you can't just buy anything. But going through 23 members of the group, Arista Networks (ANET) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) were two names that jumped out as leaders last month and both were considered for IBD's SwingTrader. Both had high Composite Ratings, but Juniper had better volume characteristics ahead of its earnings report on April 25 after the close (1).The stock vaulted after earnings and was added the next day at 29.49 as it broke out on huge volume (2). It wasn't added immediately at the open, but was watched closely in the first couple hours of the trading session to see if it would hold its gains.Within four days, on May 2, the stock was already ahead 5%, so profits were taken on half the position (3) at 30.91. A consolidation started the next day as Juniper dropped below its 5-day moving average line (4), prompting the removal of the remaining position at 30.36. The average exit price was 30.64 for a 3.9% gain in six days.The consolidation stands at eight days now and could provide another opportunity in the stock as the group remains strong. Other groups showing three-month strength according to MarketSmith include: education, semiconductors, internet content and casino stocks. You also may want to pay attention when stocks from different groups show a similar theme. Many of the above groups sport leaders coming out of China, which is confirmed by the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) reaching new highs.More details on Past Trades are available to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Make Sure Your Swing Trades Share This One FactorIndustry Group Moves Reveal Stock OpportunitiesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

49,JNPR,"Gigamon (GIMO) stock popped Monday after Reuters reported the company has hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options a few weeks after activist investor Elliott Management took a large stake in the maker of communications-network appliances and security gear.Gigamon stock rose 8.9% to 42.80 in the stock market today, closing just below its 200-day moving average after hitting 44.55 intraday.Elliott Management in May disclosed that it had built a 15.3% stake in the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company.Gigamon could draw interest from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), F5 Networks (FFIV) as well as private equity firms such as Thoma Bravo, according to Reuters. Gigamon's communications-network appliances analyze data traffic.The developments prompted Needham & Co. to hike its price target to 50 from 34.IBD'S TAKE: Gigamon was a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks in mid-2016. Gigamon stock plunged in late November on disappointing earnings and outlook. The IBD 50 now includes tech stocks such as Lumentum Holdings, Veeva Systems, and Lam Research.""We think the odds have significantly increased that Gigamon could be acquired,"" said Alex Henderson, a Needham analyst in a report. ""We think a fair value is in the 50 to 55 range.""Henderson went on to say: ""We think Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR), F5, HPE, Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), Riverbed, and a number of private investors are likely to be among the names that would be interested in Gigamon.""Gigamon competitors include Cisco, Ixia and NetScout (NTCT).

51,JNPR,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) could miss fiscal Q4 revenue consensus estimates amid weak IT spending and share losses to rival Arista Networks (ANET), says Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha.Cisco is scheduled to report earnings for its fiscal Q4 ended July 30 on Aug. 17 after the close. Cisco stock is trading near nine-year highs, up 0.3% to 30.95 in the stock market today, near 31.While 22 analysts rate Cisco a strong buy or buy, and 14 rate the computer networking firm as hold, Garcha is the lone analyst with an underperform rating, according to Thomson Reuters.Cisco's fiscal Q4 revenue is expected to fall 2% to $12.57 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. ""We continue to see the enterprise and service provider spending environment as subdued and would enter this earnings quarter with caution,"" wrote Garcha in a research report. ""We currently model fiscal Q4 revenue of $12.54 billion (-2.4%).""He says Arista Networks has been taking share at Cisco's expense in computer network switching gear.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco's stock has climbed 13% in 2016, while Arista Network's shares are down about 4%. Both are in the Computer Networking group. Arista Network's Composite Rating of 96 leads the group. Cisco upped its dividend by 24% in February and most gains have followed.

52,JNPR,"Startups led by Viptela are giving Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) a big challenge in the emerging market for software-defined wide area networking (WAN) equipment, says asset management firm Robert W. Baird.Telecom companies such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) are shifting to software-based, so-called ""intelligent networking architectures"" to serve enterprise customers. Cisco and Viptela are Verizon's initial technology partners for the telecom company's recently announced virtual network service, Baird said in a research report.Large companies, meanwhile, view software-defined WANs as a way to lower costs, according to the Baird report.According to market research firm IDC, the software-defined WAN market, which generated revenue of just roughly $225 million in 2015, is expected to top $6 billion by 2020.""By replacing expensive and operationally complex MPLS routers with virtualized and lower-cost connectivity options like broadband, enterprise IT departments can substantially reduce spending to service providers and simplify WAN management,"" said Baird analyst Jayson Noland in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco stock hit a nine-year high Tuesday. The computer networking gear maker has been growing revenue from software and services. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Noland says startups such as Viptela, CloudGenix and VeloCloud are winning software-defined WAN business. He says they're potential acquisition targets of Cisco and Juniper.""At this nascent stage of the market, we expect to see M&A and industry consolidation in the relatively near future,"" said Noland. ""Riverbed entered the SD-WAN market by acquiring German startup Ocedo at the start of 2016. … Leading networking vendors like Cisco, which have not only cash available, but also appetites for acquisitions and ongoing partnerships with SD-WAN developers, may contribute to such a trend.""Cisco stock, which hit a nearly nine-year high of 31.25 on Tuesday, ended trading Wednesday down fractionally to 30.85 on the stock market today. Juniper stock also was down a fraction to 23.01.

53,JNPR,"The median salary for a cybersecurity job is 2.7 times that of average wages in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., yet 82% of organizations in those countries are experiencing a shortage in skilled cybersecurity workers, chipmaker Intel (INTC) found in a poll by its Intel Security business.More than half (53%) of respondents say the cybersecurity skills shortage is worse than talent deficits in other IT professions.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski agrees. Cybersecurity firms ""can't hire people fast enough,"" he told IBD.A major challenge is that cybersecurity jobs require much more than a degree and applicable coding abilities, says Candace Worley, vice president of enterprise solutions marketing for Intel Security. Some of the best cybersecurity workers, she says, have hacking backgrounds, a skill with a questionable reputation in the industry. But it's a skill she calls crucial.IBD'S TAKE: Most stocks make their biggest gains fairly early in their publicly-traded lives, so IBD's IPO Leaders list is worth tracking. Security firm CyberArk Software is on the current list, making its IPO in September 2014 at $16 a share and now trading near 55.""Computer science and math degrees provide a certain intellectual skill set, but (they) don't necessarily hone the hunting and detective skills required for this industry,"" Worley told IBD. ""Coding, incident response ... there are a lot of skills required to play in the cybersecurity space.""Over the course of May, Intel Security teamed up with market research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey security staff at 775 companies and other organizations of 500-plus employees, in eight countries.Some jobs are especially hard to fill, Worley said. Jobs in intrusion detection, attack mitigation and software development -- creating software that is less susceptible to hacking -- are the ones that most often go begging, she says. Those skills are rarer than less-technical abilities like communications and management.To that point, Intel Security noted the highest technical security job last year in the U.S. paid $233,333 annually. That's $8,000 more than most chief information security officers (CISOs) make, according to job tracker Dice.Last year, the U.S. left 209,000 unfilled security jobs on the table, Intel said, citing a Peninsula Press analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That's about $41.8 billion in unpaid salaries, assuming a $200,000 average wage for each position. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (71%) say the shortage in skills left their organizations vulnerable to attack.The trend is continuing this year, but perhaps at a slower pace, according to Piper Jaffray's Nowinski. In June, there were 2,843 unfilled jobs at 13 cybersecurity firms in the U.S., according to job-postings information examined by Piper Jaffray. At, say, $200,000 a head, that's roughly $570 million in unfilled salaries. Among those with the most total open positions were KEYW Corp. (KEYW) (658), Fortinet (FTNT) (459) and Symantec (SYMC) (431).Overall, however, the number of unfilled positions at those 13 firms fell 28% in June vs. June 2015, and they fell 25% in May vs. a year earlier. In April, though, the number of unfilled jobs had risen 14%.Nowinski credits the fewer unfilled posts in June and May not just to companies filling slots, but also to some layoffs. Such was likely the case for Symantec. It had 71% fewer technical job openings this June vs. June 2015, but in May it announced 1,200 layoffs.""Cybersecurity firms can't hire people fast enough,"" he said.Networking companies such as Brocade Communications (BRCD), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) can fill technical jobs more easily because the required skills are similar, Nowinski says. ""But (jobs at) Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and) Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) are all vastly different,"" requiring multiple specialists, he said.Organizations aren't all on the same page in terms of hiring practices, says Intel's Worley. The lion's share of respondents (68%) to the survey say hands-on experience is critical to developing cybersecurity skills. And though more than half require at least a bachelor's degree, 23% say education isn't properly preparing students.There is a lack of master's programs for cybersecurity, says Tim Ashford, IT director for Ashford Capital Management, an independent research and analysis firm. Ashford is working toward his master's of science in information security engineering with the SANS Institute.The SANS Institute provides cybersecurity training for more than 165,000 security professionals worldwide, and it offers two cybersecurity master's programs. Two summers ago, Ashford, a 19-year veteran of the IT industry, began looking for cybersecurity programs.""I hit up websites like MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Stanford (University) and saw courses here and there, but as far as programs for preparing people with hacking techniques, managed qualitative skills, I saw next to none of that,"" he told IBD.In December 2014, the SANS Institute had just six graduates of its program, Ashford says. But breaches like those of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and LinkedIn (LNKD), dating back to 2013, have spiked interest, he says. Like Worley, he says there's a need for cybersecurity professionals who can ""break stuff.""Also like Worley, Ashford cites a need to reach younger minds.""You've got to find a way to get kids to think about cyber,"" Ashford said. ""It's part deconstruction, breaking things down. But there's always a delicate risk with kids. Let's teach them how to break stuff, but also educate them on the heart and soul of cybersecurity.""Workers at cybersecurity companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Check Point and Fortinet try to hunt down the origins of a breach, close it and then remedy the potential fallout.""That takes ability to deduct, it takes problem-solving, and it takes logic,"" Worley said. ""We're unlikely to see a decline in hacking and malware, so we're seeing the industry work with high schools and universities to build the curriculum.""Government also has a role to play. But 76% of respondents say their governments aren't investing enough in cybersecurity talent, and the same percentage say the laws and regulations surrounding security infrastructure in their nations are insufficient.In the U.S., Obama has pledged $19 billion for fiscal 2017, which starts Oct. 1, to bolster the government's aging security infrastructure. That could boost spending, but Piper Jaffray's Nowinski says that won't necessarily produce more qualified folks to fill cybersecurity jobs.Yet, 9 in 10 respondents say technology can help organizations fill the hole in skilled security workers. More than half (55%) say technology like automation and managed security service offerings will advance sufficiently in five years to meet the majority of a firm's security needs.Worley isn't as bullish on the rapid advance of security automation, but she says the idea is getting greater acceptance. Automation is a relatively nascent tool, relying on supercomputers like IBM's (IBM) Watson to hunt needle-in-the-haystack security abnormalities or automate update deployments.""If you go back a decade, most people were extremely uncomfortable with automation,"" she said. ""But now, and most companies are more tolerant of automation.""Still, she emphasized, ""skills that require significant analysis will continue to require human intervention.""RELATED:

55,JNPR,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) earnings growth might slow amid mounting competitive pressure from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and a “refocused” Juniper Networks (JNPR), says Goldman Sachs, which on Wednesday downgraded Cisco to neutral from buy.Cisco stock closed down 1.1% at 28.65 in the stock market today.While Cisco already faces “significant pressure” from Nokia (which this year completed its $17 billion acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent), Arista Networks (ANET), and China-based Huawei, new threats are emerging, says a Goldman Sachs research report. “We see heightened competitive pressure from a more focused HPE following its acquisition of Aruba last year and split from HPQ,” Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in the report. “In the data center segment, we see Juniper as a more meaningful competitor.”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., which focuses on PCs and printers. HPE last month said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC).HPE now could be on the prowl for acquisitions, analysts say.“Cisco has been able to offset share losses in networking with share gains in servers, but we see those as largely exhausted now,” Jankowski said. “In addition, the significant increase in management turnover over the last few months raises execution risks over the medium term.”Some analysts have speculated that Cisco could buy a data storage company with software expertise in converged infrastructure.“We believe HPE now has a much more rounded networking portfolio with the Aruba asset, as well as a much stronger focus on enterprise IT infrastructure,” added Jankowski. “In addition, its leadership in servers and significant presence in storage (where Cisco only participates through partnerships rather than directly) can give it a competitive advantage in situations where the customer is looking for bundled solutions.""HPE’s significantly lower margin structure allows it to undercut Cisco on price.”

56,JNPR,"Stocks finished mixed Tuesday after a morning rally faded. Rising energy prices and a late report that F5 Networks (FFIV) is in talks regarding a possible sale provided the day's excitement.The Nasdaq finished down 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.1% each in the stock market today. Small-cap stocks outperformed. The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%. Volume was also mixed, with the NYSE reporting higher volume but the Nasdaq exchange reporting lower turnover, according to preliminary figures.In the last hour of trading, F5 Networks vaulted 13% with a big volume spike on reports it was in talks with Goldman Sachs (GS) about a possible sale, according to Reuters.Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Citrix Systems (CTXS) also popped on the report.Oil continued to rise. West Texas Intermediate futures for July delivery settled up 79 cents to $50.48 a barrel. That's the first close above $50 for U.S. crude in 11 months. Declining production, along with fires in Canada and terrorism in Nigeria, have combined to double the price of crude since February.Among IBD 50 stocks, 37 were higher and 13 were lower. The best performer was Thor Industries (THO), which reported better-than-expected earnings but missed slightly on revenue. It gapped up on big volume for a nearly 6% gain.How Does Thor Industries earnings and revenue growth measure up with other leading stocks?The Dow was helped by advances for its two energy components, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). They rose 2% apiece on the strength of oil prices.But Verizon (VZ) was also a big contributor to the Dow's outperformance, popping by more than 2%. Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said at an industry conference that an acquisition of Yahoo (YHOO) would fit nicely into the company's strategy. It also expects a per-share hit to Q2 earnings of 5 to 7 cents because Verizon's recent labor strike required it to pay managers overtime and hire lots of contractors, while new installations lagged.

57,JNPR,"RBC Capital says it’s bullish on the sustainability of Cisco Systems’ (CSCO) gross profit margins in the wake of the networking leader's fiscal Q3 earnings beat.“Cisco continues to shift toward a recurring revenue business model with lower exposure to legacy routing and switching,” Mitch Steves, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a research report Monday.Steves said RBC is ""bullish on gross margins, given about $9 billion to $10 billion in software-related revenue and improved mix post the set-top box divestiture.” Cisco sold its set-top business to French firm Technicolor last July.Steves has an outperform rating on Cisco stock, with a price target of 33. Cisco stock ticked down 3 cents to 27.94 at the close in the stock market today, after rising Thursday and Friday.Late Wednesday, Cisco said revenue for its fiscal Q3 ended April 30 rose 3% from the year-earlier period, to $12 billion, just beating the consensus estimate of $11.97 billion, as polled by Thomson Reuters. Earnings per share minus items rose 5.6% to 57 cents, edging the consensus of 55 cents.Cisco has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 64 out of a possible 99.“Cisco is continuing to change its business model, offering switching/routing at lower costs in exchange for higher services/software revenue,” said Steves. “At this point we do not see a material change in margins, given the business model changes.”Cisco rival Juniper Networks (JNPR), meanwhile, was downgraded to market perform from outperform by William Blair, where analyst Dmitry Netis has just picked up coverage.In a research note Monday, Netis said the transition from routers and switches to newer technologies, software-defined networking and network function virtualization remains an overhang for Juniper.He also wrote that ""the spending environment has not been particularly robust this year,"" pointing to Cisco's earnings last week.Juniper stock was down 1%, to 22.49 at the close. Its shares have fallen 18% so far this year, while Cisco stock is up a fraction over the same period.

Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Lowe's (LOW) rose, but Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Whole Foods Market (WFM) sank.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running below Tuesday's levels on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Stocks got a lift early in the session from a report showing that New York-area manufacturing unexpectedly turned positive in June, helping to offset a bigger-than-expected decline in May U.S. industrial output.The Federal Reserve is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET. Economists expect the central bank to hold interest rates steady in a range of 0.25%-0.50%.Retail stocks were among the best performers, while utilities, medical and computer stocks were among the weakest.Home furnishings and repair retailer Lowe's rose 2% and reclaimed its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. However, the stock remains just below a 77.73 buy point following five straight declines.Lululemon, a yoga apparel retailer, rose more than 1% and is still in buy range above a 69.83 buy point.

"
59,JNPR,"Fears of a broad cybersecurity freeze could amplify after vendors Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye (FEYE) missed April-quarter expectations and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Imperva (IMPV) guided toward slower growth.Then again, rather than a broad slowdown, the pure-play security leaders might in fact be losing some business to tech giants Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), which are expanding deeper into security, and to specialized security vendors such as CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast (MIME).""Investors tend to look at security as a single sector, and the reality is you have a lot of different plays here,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens told IBD. ""In aggregate, we're seeing relatively consistent spending. There is some shifting that is happening, but that makes sense.""Security spending overall rose 13% year over year in Q1, barely down from 14% growth in Q4, Owens says. He says those growth rates are consistent with the past two years.Palo Alto, Fortinet and Check Point all had been hot stocks in 2014 and much of 2015 on the strength of their broad security platforms, but not this year. The focus has shifted to specific security areas such as privileged account management, email and cloud security, and endpoint protection, analysts say. So, while some vendors might be slowing, others are rising, Owens says.Fears of a broad security slowdown go back to last year, Owens told IBD.""We've been having this end-of-the-world discussion for a year now,"" he said. ""Certain vendors that may have been growing at rapid rates (have) decelerated.""Palo Alto Networks -- the No. 2 security software company by market cap, behind Check Point -- is an industry bellwether.Last month, Palo Alto disappointed Wall Street. It guided to 37% year-over-year sales growth for the current quarter, which would be great for most companies but would represents the highflier's slowest-ever growth. Last quarter was the first in eight where its sales rose less than 50%.But the slowdown is relative, Pacific Crest's Owens says.""Palo Alto will continue to perform well, but it can't continue to grow at four times the industry,"" he said. ""Fifty percent to 60% growth is unsustainable.""Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski anticipated slow April demand for Palo Alto products, citing checks with resellers.But Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick characterized the April slowdown as a ""blip"" in a typically seasonally weak quarter. She blamed FireEye CEO David DeWalt for the panic. During FireEye's fiscal Q3 earnings call in November 2015, DeWalt said ""emergency spending"" in the wake of the notable Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) breaches had normalized.""The CEO of FireEye last year said, 'You're just not having all these big breaches and we're not getting attacked from China as much, so spending is slow,'"" she said. ""So, everyone has been chanting the mantra.""(DeWalt is set to step down June 15, leaving COO and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia to take the reins. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.)Palo Alto Networks wasn't the only pure player to spot braking growth. On May 5, FireEye guided to its slowest quarter ever, and Imperva's outlook for this quarter would mark a fourth straight quarter of sales deceleration. In April, Check Point guided to 6% growth for Q2, down from six straight periods of 9% growth.Fortinet expects sales growth to slow to 27% in Q2 from 34% growth in the prior quarter. And even email specialist Proofpoint -- among those analysts peg as on the rise -- guided to its slowest quarterly growth in 11 quarters, to 32% growth from 37% the prior quarter.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group reflects fears of a general tech slowdown. The group was down as much as 34% for the year in early February, hitting a two-year low, as many tech stocks tanked on dour views from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). The group has since recovered in part, but is still down nearly 16% for the year.Cybersecurity Ventures Managing Editor Steve Morgan says pure players like Palo Alto, Check Point and Fortinet are no longer good barometers for the health of the industry. Instead, thousands of venture-capital-backed startups -- as well as tech giants increasingly expanding their security presence -- are gouging share.In Q1, IBM pulled in $400 million in security sales -- topping Palo Alto, Fortinet and FireEye, and closing in on Symantec (SYMC) -- up 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 12% growth in all of 2015. Its overall sales fell 5%. For its fiscal Q3 ended April 30, Cisco said its security sales jumped 17% year over year, accelerating from 11% growth in fiscal Q2.Still, the accelerating growth for the IBM and Cisco security businesses falls short of the decelerating growth for most of the pure players. The big companies, though, aren't going away.Microsoft (MSFT) swept three cybersecurity players off the public map in 2015 via acquisitions, but the company doesn't break out its cybersecurity revenue, Morgan points out. And Dell subsidiary SonicWall, acquired in 2012, is potentially pulling in billions, but since Dell is now privately held those figures aren't reported publicly.""That revenue just goes away from what's reported in the public market,"" Morgan told IBD. ""Unless you cover the market really carefully, you won't hear about it.""But the cybersecurity VC market is still booming, he says. In 2015, Dow Jones estimated that $1.9 billion in VC funding was spent backing cybersecurity startups, Morgan says. At one time, it was unheard of for cybersecurity startups to raise more than high single digits in funding, and ""now we're routinely seeing (funding hit) $50 million, $75 million, $100 million.""Those VC-backed companies are ""competing aggressively in the market,"" Morgan said. ""But if they're not public, their revenue figures aren't necessarily being reported.""As private businesses like MalwareBytes, the Herjavec Group (tied to Robert Herjavec of the ""Shark Tank"" TV show) and Black Duck Software begin to achieve scale, they'll further steal share from the publicly traded security firms, Morgan says.Pacific Crest's Owens sees pent-up demand. He says companies still aren't spending enough on security. He ballparks annual IT spending overall near $1 trillion, and cybersecurity spending at $25 billion to $30 billion.""I think security has been an under-spend area for decades,"" he said. ""You're spending about 3% of your capex (capital expenditures) that's focused on IT on security. That's relatively low. Some regulated industries like health care might be two or three times that, but there's still a long way to go.""Building up security spending takes time, Owens says.""There's that perception that you're able to spend an unlimited amount of dollars overnight within security, but that's just not the case in reality,"" he said. ""It's not an overnight type of thing.""Network security still has headroom, Owens says, and he sees products focused on authentication, detection, remediation and endpoint solutions as leaders. Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury pegs privileged account management -- CyberArk's bread and butter -- as the industry's next growth vector. Dougherty's Trebnick expects email security providers like Proofpoint and Mimecast to pick up share. Morgan's bet is on cloud security.Meanwhile, Symantec, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and FireEye will continue to struggle, Owens says. Symantec may ""throw out billions in cash flow"" to survive attempts to transition from legacy antivirus to next-generation endpoint protection. FireEye is shifting to a subscription model. Juniper and Barracuda deal with broader macro issues outside cybersecurity, he says.So, back to the original question: Is security spending slowing?Not for many, Morgan says.""What I think you're seeing is a squeeze on the pure-play company,"" he said. But overall, instead of any slowdown, ""I think we're entering an uptick. Spending is up, undoubtedly.""

60,JNPR,"Negative trends in the enterprise market -- large companies and government agencies -- are lowering expectations ahead of Cisco Systems' (CSCO) fiscal Q3 earnings, due out Wednesday after the market close.Many large companies are outsourcing business computing workloads to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), lessening their need for the routers, switches and other networking gear sold by Cisco and others.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate Cisco earnings minus items will rise 2% to 55 cents, though they see revenue falling 1% to $11.97 billion.“We see three major issues into this earnings release, including weak IT data points, all signaling industrywide IT spending weakness, less visibility around service provider spending, and global macro exposure,” Kulbinder Garcha, a Credit Suisse analyst, said in a research report.“Year to date, we have seen weak IT spending indications from large bellwethers including IBM (IBM), EMC (EMC), Juniper (JNPR), Brocade (BRCD) and SAP (SAP),” added Garcha, who has an underperform rating on the stock.JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall, in a research report, cited negative enterprise market commentary from Intel (INTC), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Reports of slower tech spending was a factor in the stock market's plunge early in the year.With many tech companies struggling to meet expectations recently, an in-line quarter for Cisco might be good enough to move shares higher, said Citigroup analyst Jim Suva.RW Baird's Jayson Noland was another analyst citing slower spending of late. “Our partner survey results indicate a softer-than-expected April quarter, with improved prospects for growth for the remainder of calendar 2016,” Noland wrote in a research note.Cisco stock, up 1% near 27 in early trading in the stock market today, is about even in 2016. Cisco stock is up 20% since touching a two-year low in early February.
"
61,JNPR,"The thrill of Juniper Networks (JNPR) management's optimism, despite their Q2 guidance miss, seemed to wear thin on investors who started Friday with a 2.6% pop but watched their stock deflate all day along with the overall stock market.After Thursday's close, Juniper, the biggest computer networking rival of No. 1 Cisco Systems (CSCO), disclosed refined first-quarter earnings and revenue growth that missed initial guidance. It surprised no one, since Juniper pre-annnounced similar numbers on April 11 while warning of delays from its big telecom service customers and some weakness in enterprise market demand for Juniper products, notably the EX Series ethernet switches and SRX Series next-generation data-center firewall.Indeed, Q1 enterprise sales fell 19% from Q1 2015, and telecom delays led service provider revenue to fall 16%, the company said. Juniper also guided Q2 below analyst Wall Street models.Nonetheless, CEO Rami Rahim was optimistic about the full year in his conference call with analysts after the earnings release, and investors seemed to key off that optimism early in the stock market today. But near the session's close, Juniper stock was flat, near 23, 27% off a five-year high 32.39 set Nov. 4. Cisco stock was down 1.5% late Friday.""We are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to the timing of these (delayed telecom) deployments as well as some early and important design wins with our new products,"" Rahim told the analysts. ""We remain constructive on the full year 2016 and intend to continue to make progress toward our long-term financial model.""Having closed on its acquisition of BTI Systems on April 1, which should add about $12.5 million in initial quarterly sales, Juniper guided current Q2 revenue down 2.6% to $1.19 billion, plus or minus $30 million, yielding non-GAAP earnings per share of 44 cents to 50 cents, which at the 47-cent midpoint is down 11% from Q2 2015's 53 cents.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $1.2 billion and 49 cents.For Q1, Juniper reported revenue up 3% to $1.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS up 16% to 37 cents.  But initially Juniper had guided Q1 to $1.17 billion and 44 cents.Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal lowered his price target on Juniper stock to 24 from 26, reiterating a neutral rating.""We found talk of new telco architectures and the need to diversify from telcos concerning,"" Kvaal wrote in a Friday research note. ""We have argued NFV (network function virtualization) is real, here and hurting routing -- here is more evidence. We view telco as (about) 40% of sales. We found comments on linearity, product migrations and switch/router integration perplexing, even conflicting.""But William Blair analyst Jason Ader reiterated an outperform rating on Juniper stock, ""based on our 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $2.05,"" or four cents more than consensus, he wrote in a Friday research note.""We continue to like the risk/reward equation for the stock in view of the operational improvements, capital allocation focus and likelihood of a second-half rebound in switching and routing,"" Ader wrote.

"
63,JNPR,"The major indexes remained stronger early Tuesday afternoon, reaching session highs after a midday pause.The S&P 500 and Dow industrials led with gains of 0.8% and nearly 0.9%, respectively, thanks mainly to a rally in the energy sector. Oil stocks gushed on news that Russia and Saudi Arabia had reportedly reached an agreement to hammer out a production cut, even if Iran doesn't go along with it. Crude oil was up more than 3% to $41.63 a barrel, crossing above the 200-day moving average.The Nasdaq was up 0.5%, advancing again after its rebound stalled for about an hour. The small-cap Russell 1000 led with a 1% gain.Volume was tracking sharply higher than at the same time Monday. Winners led decliners by 4-to-1 on the NYSE, and by 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq was running behind, not just because the energy sector was outperforming in today's stock market, but also because technology shares struggled.The sector's sell-off was sparked by Juniper Networks (JNPR), which preannounced quarterly results that missed estimates and cut its Q1 revenue outlook. Shares of the networking company tumbled 8% in heavy trading, deepening a long price correction.Other major tech stocks moving lower included F5 Networks (FFIV) and Brocade Communications (BRCD), each down 2%.Networking, software and chip industry groups were among the day's weakest. Cybersecurity stocks also lagged, with that industry group down 1.3% at midday.Starbucks (SBUX) gapped down 3%, falling to its converged 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The stock continued to work on saucer-type base. Deutsche Bank downgraded the company to hold from buy and cut its price target to 64 from 70.Analyst Brett Levy said a new Starbucks rewards program, which many customers have criticized, could slow sales traffic.

64,JNPR,"With a  14th week in its current third fiscal quarter and apparently enough momentum to hit 2016 consensus even if its switching business continues to weaken, Cisco Systems (CSCO) earned an upgrade from JPMorgan Wednesday.JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall used a proprietary statistical model suggesting ""limited downside"" for the world's most essential computer networking gear maker, assuming 2.5% global GDP growth in 2016. The model predicts calendar 2016 revenue of $49.1 billion, in line with consensus, Hall said in a research note to investors. The prediction helped him upgrade Cisco stock to neutral from underweight, and raise its price target to 27.50 from 17.Already ahead of his target by eight cents by the time the market closed Tuesday, Cisco stock responded early by jumping 1.2% by midday to 27.91 in the stock market today, putting it within 6% of a 29.90 high hit May 18 and 7.8% below an eight-year high set March 2, 2015.Among Cisco's most aggressive rivals, Juniper Networks’ (JNPR) stock was up 1% to 25.48 by midday Wednesday.That 14th week for the quarter and 53rd week for the year happens every sixth year or so for some companies that normally count 13-week quarters, a source of confusion for some investors that is ""now famous,"" Hall noted. He said that Cisco ""cautiously guided revenue"" for the 14th week, and Wall Street analyst consensus acknowledges that midpoint scenario, but JPMorgan's estimates ""adjusts for this.""""We believe this not only sets Cisco up to beat expectations in fiscal (Q3) but to guide well for (Q4),"" he said.For Cisco's switching gear, JPMorgan is modeling ""conservative campus and data center port share and ASPs (application service providers), but this is offset by better routing and security growth,"" Hall said, assuming that better Chinese and Indian acceleration will offset slower U.S. growth.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate EPS of 55 cents minus items for the current Q3 ending April 30, up 2% from a year earlier, on slipping revenue to $11.976 billion, down 1.3% from $12.137 billion in the year-earlier quarter.Hall revised his adjusted Q3 EPS estimate up a penny to 58 cents, his full fiscal 2016 EPS estimate up two cents to $2.31 and his full fiscal-year revenue model up by $139 million to $49.284 billion.""We continue to see commoditization as a major challenge for Cisco’s switching business,"" Hall said. ""However, we believe impacts are likely to remain muted in 2016 with the potential to increase in 2017 as private and public cloud adoption accelerate.""While his upgraded neutral rating on Cisco doesn't sound like a robust endorsement, Hall sees investors ""getting paid to hold.""""Cisco’s current dividend yield of 3.8% places it among the top dividend-yielding large-cap value names in the S&P 500 after a surprise 24% dividend increase on Feb. 10,"" he said. ""We see this highly dependable cash return as a critical supporting factor for the stock in the midst of current market volatility and believe the company has the firepower to further increase should they wish to do so.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

65,JNPR,"Highly rated chipmakers Macom Tech (MTSI), Microsemi (MSCC), MaxLinear (MXL), Inphi (IPHI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) are dropping in heavy volume today, though they pared their losses as the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied by the early afternoon.Some of the selling pressure is potentially coming from Juniper Networks' (JNPR) earnings preannouncement late Monday.The networking equipment vendor lowered its first-quarter revenue and earnings expectations below Wall Street estimates, citing weaker-than-anticipated demand from enterprise customers.Macom tumbled below its 50-day line and the 40 price level in intraday trade, but the shares found support at those levels, and closed down 1.4% at 40.79. The stock is trading 10% below its recent high.Microsemi is plunged below buy range intraday from a cup-with-handle base buy point it initially cleared in mid-March. But shares pared losses to ended 1.7% lower, still in buy range. Earlier, shares neared the 50-day line, which recently crossed back above the 200-day line as the stock’s performance improved.MaxLinear also dropped back below buy range intraday from a base it initially cleared in early March, though it pared its losses, to finished 2.3% lower. Several weeks ago, the stock dipped back below buy range but found support at the 50-day line before regaining composure.Inphi is still well extended from a double-bottom entry at 28.54, but it tested the lower bound of its buy range from an alternate entry at 32.42. Shares dipped 1.1% to 33.47.And Apple (AAPL) supplier Cirrus Logic is testing support at its 50-day line, but it bounced back to closed up 0.45%. Shares are trading 6% below their high set last May. Apple, for its part, rose 1.3%.Meanwhile, Juniper Networks gapped down 7.35% on the bearish outlook, plunging below its 50-day line in giant volume. The stock is now 28% below its November peak.

Valeant's pricing practices are being reviewed by the government. Valeant fell initially but turned up 2% to 31.99.On the tech front, Mizuho raised its price targets on Apple chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and radio frequency player Qorvo (QRVO). Qualcomm's went to 49 from 47 with a neutral rating -- still below Monday's close at 51. It raised Qorvo's PT to 55 from 50, with a buy.  Qualcomm fell 0.35% to 50.82 and Qorvo 0.65% to 47.68.Apple rose 1.3% to 110.44. Apple once again closed just below its 200-day moving average.

67,JNPR,"Earnings still matter. So do big earnings surprises. Tuesday's sell-off by Juniper Networks (JNPR) sparked sympathy-selling among networking gear makers after the midcap play reported preliminary first-quarter earnings that sharply missed consensus views. Wall Street had expected profit to jump 38%. Of course, such a negative announcement can happen to members of the IBD 50. How can one minimize the risk?…

68,JNPR,"When enterprise clients slow down purchases, and Internet service providers delay capital expenditures, Juniper Networks (JNPR) has a problem. The top computer-networking gear maker not named Cisco Systems (CSCO) pre-announced just such a first-quarter situation after the market close Monday, sending networking stocks lower Tuesday.Juniper stock fell 7.4%, to 23.06, in the stock market today, as at least three investment banks lowered their price target. Cisco stock was flat. The IBD Computer-Networking industry group fell 1.3%. Shares of Arista Networks (ANET) and rival Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) slipped 2.7% and 2.1%, respectively.Chips stocks weren't faring much better. IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group fell a fraction and had been down more than 4%, while the Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group also slipped a fraction. Microsemi (MSCC) fell 1.7%, MaxLinear (MXL) 2.3%, and Inphi (IPHI) 1.1% -- though all had been down more than 3% earlier.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi dropped his price target for Juniper stock to 25 from 27 and maintained a sector perform rating.""The primary reasons for the weakness include weaker-than-anticipated demand from enterprise (customers) and the timing of deployments of certain U.S. and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) Tier 1 telecoms,"" Seyrafi wrote in a research note Tuesday. ""It is somewhat disappointing to see the weakness in EMEA telecoms (which was the case in fiscal Q4 as well), especially considering that in Q4, JNPR's service provider segment grew by a strong 25% year over year and that JNPR had an easy compare in the Q1 service provider segment (where revenue declined 8% year over year the year before).""Seyrafi noted that AT&T (T) expects to grow capital expenditures 6% to $22 billion this year, while Verizon (VZ) implied a 3% decline in capex to a range of $17.2 billion to $17.8 billion. ""So U.S.-based service providers will likely not be driving much growth for communication equipment suppliers this year,"" he said.""We do think that Juniper felt what Cisco (outperform-rated) noted in February, namely that some customers paused to digest what was happening following financial market turbulence at the beginning of the year,"" Seyrafi wrote. ""However, we do note that financial markets rebounded in March, and JNPR CEO Rami Rahim stated that the company remains constructive on fiscal 2016 as the company expects new products to add to growth while the company maintains ongoing focus on cost discipline.""Juniper said that it expects to report earnings per share minus items of 35 cents to 37 cents, down from its prior guidance of 42-46 cents. Wall Street had expected 43-44 cents, up 34% to 38% from Q1 2015. Juniper's new midpoint, 36 cents, would be up 12%.Juniper expects Q1 revenue of $1.09 billion to $1.10 billion, down from its prior guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.19 billion.

Neither Ader nor Henderson have price targets for Juniper stock.""While we see Juniper as one of the weaker companies in our coverage, there could be read-throughs to other names such as Cisco, F5 Networks (FFIV) and Viavi (VIAV),"" Henderson said in a Tuesday research note. ""We think Arista and Gigamon (GIMO) are likely to be able to power through the choppy environment.

70,JNPR,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple's (AAPL) encryption battle with the FBI flashed again Wednesday as Silicon Valley bigwigs largely sided with the iPhone-maker during the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Calif., saying the policies of their companies also wouldn't allow for government backdoor access.The debate at the big annual security event also followed the arrest Tuesday of Diego Dzodan, a Facebook (FB) exec in Brazil, who refused to decrypt WhatsApp communications in compliance with a government order. Dzodan's arrest was yet another flash point in the ongoing battle. Wednesday, a Brazilian judge ordered police to set Dzodan free.At an RSA panel discussion Wednesday Michelle Dennedy, Cisco Systems' (CSCO) chief privacy officer, said the network gear giant, per policy, wouldn't provide the government backdoor access to encrypted communications. Silicon Valley companies such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook and Microsoft (MSFT) also have sided with Apple.Congress has yet to legislate backdoors, and outdated telecom laws don't tackle the now-hot topic. The Paris terror attacks and a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., have reignited the issue on Capitol Hill, where legislators are weighing privacy concerns against law enforcement needs.In the latter case, the FBI ordered Apple to decrypt the iPhone belonging to one of the two San Bernardino shooters. Apple is fighting the order. Cisco's policy would put it in the same hot waters, Dennedy said.""We do not intentionally build in backdoors, and we do not do business with others who do,"" she said. ""That is our policy.""Dennedy's position was echoed throughout the discussion, entitled ""Can Government, Encryption, Backdoor and Privacy Co-Exist?"" Backdoor access can act as a master key to all encrypted communications within a system. Apple's engineers haven't created that key, Apple CEO Tim Cook says.Intentional or not, backdoor access will backfire, Johns Hopkins University associate professor Matthew Green argued Wednesday.In December, Juniper Networks (JNPR) discovered unauthorized code running on an operating system backing their firewalls that let hackers decrypt VPN-protected communications, Green said. Experts have speculated a National Security Agency random-number generator, employed by Juniper, was to blame for the exploited backdoor.""This is the danger with backdoors,"" Green said. ""Juniper was protecting the Department of Defense and could not keep people from monitoring their code.""Richard Marshall, CEO of Secure Exchange Technology Innovations, says companies need to concentrate on existing vulnerabilities within their systems.""You don't need a designed vulnerability (such as with a backdoor) when there are so many other vulnerabilities being exploited on a day-to-day basis,"" he said. ""It's so much easier for those adversaries to break into our systems and violate our privacy.""But the panelists didn't side entirely with Apple.Marshall argued that U.S., and other, consumers have accepted the idea of reduced privacy.Chenxi Wang, chief security officer for Twistlock and the panel's moderator, noted Apple pushed a U2 album out to millions of phones but won't hand over the keys for government access.""Is this a double standard?"" she asked.""This is beyond a double standard,"" Marshall said. ""This goes to the actual user and their reduced expectation of privacy. It's a dangerous, slippery slope.""Dennedy, on the other hand, argued that the young-adult millennial generation is ""crying"" for privacy. Everything from their individualized clothing to the use of Snapchat messaging says as much. And therein lies the opportunity, she said.""People are trusting their commerce, their culture, their families and their communities to us (as corporations),"" she said. ""We have an ethical obligation to build privacy into their systems.""Her advice for companies?""Educate your users about what they are getting into rather than assuming, because they've fallen for your monopolistic practices, that they like it.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

72,JNPR,"Investors heaved a collective sigh late Thursday, relieved that a slowdown in network security spending didn't batter Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which delivered view-crushing fiscal Q2 earnings on its simplified platform approach.Midday on the stock market today, Palo Alto Networks stock was up 2%, near 143, after earlier rising as much as 9.7%. IBD's 41-company Computer Software-Security industry group rose as much as 4% in early trading Friday.For its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 31, Palo Alto reported 40 cents earnings per share ex items on $334.7 million in sales, up 110.5% and 54%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus view for 39 cents and $318.3 million.Sales and EPS growth, however, decelerated for the second consecutive quarter.During Q2, Palo Alto reported record billings growth of 62% year over year to $459 million, vs. consensus expectation for $417 million, Needham analyst Scott Zeller wrote in a research report.Zeller maintained his buy rating but cut his price target on Palo Alto Networks stock to 171 from 202. Palo Alto Networks isn't a ""fad"" in security, but the company will likely face some challenges in continuing billings acceleration, he wrote.Billings accelerated on 2,000 added customers and a 68% jump in subscription sales to $84.3 million. But Palo Alto Networks is a ""victim of its own success,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens wrote in a report.Palo Alto Networks cut its fiscal 2016 operating margin guidance to 18%-19% vs. earlier views for 22%-25%, noting commissions on subscription sales will impact sales-and-marketing expenses. Those expenses jumped by $16 million sequentially in Q2.""The upshot is strong free cash flow and free cash flow margin,"" Owens wrote. The company expects 40% free cash flow margin in Q3, suggesting fiscal 2016 free cash flow should reach $730 million, according to Zeller.Current-quarter guidance for $335 million-$339 million in sales topped Wall Street views for $334.9 million. But the EPS outlook for 41-42 cents missed analysts' consensus forecast for 45 cents.Sales and EPS would be up 44% and 80%, respectively, at the midpoints of Palo Alto Networks' guidance and are expected to decelerate for the third consecutive quarter.Yet Palo Alto Networks' Q2 sales increased by 50%-plus for the seventh consecutive quarter, and billings surged to the highest point in 11 straight quarters, amid concerns of a slowdown in security spending.A ""paradigm shift"" from legacy systems is buoying Palo Alto Networks, CEO Mark McLaughlin told analysts on the company's earnings conference call late Thursday. He sees Palo Alto Networks taking share from Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Juniper Networks (JNPR). Some analysts tend to agree.""I think it's very obvious we're taking share from everyone in the space,"" McLaughlin said.William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho sees Palo Alto Networks as on track to become the largest pure-play cybersecurity company. Currently, Check Point and Symantec (SYMC) have a narrow lead with $14.8 billion and $12.7 billion market values, respectively, to Palo Alto Networks' $12.6 billion.Blair maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.""Palo Alto continues to gain market share behind what we believe is flawless execution,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote in a report. Nowinski retained his overweight rating and 208 price target on Palo Alto Networks.The company's platform vision is beginning to bear fruit, Zeller wrote.""Platform (is) an overused term, but it's key to why we hear Palo Alto continues to grow 60%-plus (in billings) as others decelerate,"" he wrote. ""In an environment where there was much anxiousness about buying the point-solution of the moment, Palo Alto has crafted a position as the 'go-to' broad purchase for re-architecting security.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

74,JNPR,"Higher profit on lower revenue? Investors expecting greater efficiency out of home Wi-Fi networker Netgear (NTGR) likely won't be disappointed after the close Wednesday. That's when Wall Street expects Netgear to report that first-quarter earnings rose 30%, which would be its best showing in 17 quarters, while a decline in low-margin Internet service provider (ISP) gear might have led total sales to a 3.5% decline.All good, says Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams, who reiterated a buy rating on Netgear stock, with a 42.50 price target, in a research note issued Monday. Investors obliged by firming up the stock a fraction, near 39.50, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Netgear stock is forming a cup-with-handle base, with a 41.08 buy point. Shares are  14% off their record high 45.76 set on Dec. 7.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q1 EPS minus items of 60 cents, up 30% from the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $298 million, down 3.5%. CFO Christine Gorjanc, on the Q4 earnings call on Feb. 4, had guided Q1 sales to $290 million to $305 million, reflecting ""seasonality for the retail business unit, particularly for home security cameras, and a lower revenue outlook for the service provider business unit.""Adams wrote that ""our numbers are slightly lower (than the Street) but we do believe they can outperform our estimates and be in line if not slightly better than the Street."" He cited ""excellent fundamentals in their retail business, the disposition of the low-margin piece of the service provider business, and much lower inventories in the commercial business unit, which should lead to positive year-over-year revenues in that unit.""We should see a much-improved non-GAAP operating margin during 2016.""Adams says that ""walking away"" from the low-margin service provider sales lets Netgear focus on ""attacking markets where their product differentiation can bring higher margins."" ISPs provided about 33% of Netgear revenue last year.The No. 1 provider of networking gear to ISPs is Cisco Systems (CSCO), which is about 118 times larger than Netgear's $1.2 billion market cap. A distant No.2 is Juniper Networks (JNPR) with an $8.9 billion market value. Cisco stock was up a fraction Monday afternoon, while Juniper stock was down a fraction.Netgear's biggest niche comes from consumers, who generated 47% of Netgear revenue from 27,000 merchant locations last year. Adams is modeling 13% retail sales growth this year. Led by its Nighthawk WiFi routers and Arlo home security products, Netgear posted record retail sales in Q4, up 34%.Netgear is an enabler and beneficiary of the rising Internet of Things. Put simply, you can't connect your doohickey to the Internet without a Wi-Fi router in between, unless you use a hard-wired Ethernet connection, which Netgear also makes.""IoT continues to heat up and Netgear is in the middle of most of these developments,"" Adams said. ""We expect to see them enter another one of those markets in 2016.""Adams notes that Netgear generated more than $100 million in free cash flow last year ""and is not afraid to use it"" for stock buybacks. The Netgear board authorized a 3-million-share buyback last summer, 9.3% of outstanding shares, beyond the 19% of outstanding shares authorized in Q4 2013. ""They continue to believe it is important to return cash to shareholder in excess of strategic and operating needs,"" Adams said.

75,JNPR,"Technology companies such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google and Facebook (FB) were among 20 of the top 25 highest-paying U.S. companies in 2016, employment-related website Glassdoor said Wednesday.Competition for talent is especially fierce in the tech sector, adding pressure to pay. In recent years, tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Google have settled claims that they conspired to avoid poaching each others' workers.Apple reportedly hired Tesla’s (TSLA) former vice president of vehicle engineering, according to a report in Electrek Tuesday. Last week, Facebook said it hired Regina Dugan, who worked on ""moonshot"" projects for Google. And GoPro (GPRO) hired Danny Coster, a 20-year Apple design veteran, to be the action-camera maker's vice president of design.Despite the arms race in tech hiring, privately held consulting firm A.T. Kearney topped Glassdoor's list, with median total compensation at $167,534 and median base salary of $143,620. PwC subsidiary Strategy&, also a private consulting firm, came in second, with median compensation at $160,000 and media base salary at $147,000.From there on, tech dominated. Juniper Networks (JNPR) tops the list for techies with $157,000 in compensation and $135,000 in salary. Google came in fifth, with $153,750 in compensation and $123,331 in salary.Facebook (median base salary $127,406), Twitter (TWTR) ($133,000), LinkedIn (LNKD) ($120,000), Microsoft (MSFT) ($125,000), Adobe Systems (ADBE) ($125,000) and Salesforce.com (CRM) ($120,000) were other tech companies on the list.Among financial companies, Visa (V) made the lone appearance, though the credit card giant is listed under the information technology sector on the S&P 500. Visa's median compensation is $150,000, and its median salary is $130,000, according to Glassdoor.The admittedly unscientific report is based on company-specific salary reports that have been anonymously shared by company employees. Apple wasn't on the list.In addition to traditional forms of compensation, many tech companies have offered other perks to woo employees.Free gourmet food and ping pong tables are now passe. Newer perks include on-site doctors, free plane tickets anywhere, free Uber rides to and from work, carts that bring beer to employees' desks, and free overnight shipping of breast milk back home while new moms are on business trips.Facebook and Apple also offer to pay for egg-freezing procedures for females employees who want to delay motherhood.

76,JNPR,"The stock of Juniper Networks (JNPR), recently admired for being a sparkle in the eyes of Ericsson (ERIC), dived as much as 17% Thursday to a nine-month low, after management lowered its guidance for the first quarter and the company announced that its CFO had resigned.The stock's fall made Sanford Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu look prescient for downgrading Juniper stock Jan. 5, with the most upbeat downgrade that Juniper might ever see. While repeatedly praising Juniper for good performance, Ferragu warned that with an acquisition by Ericsson ""largely off the table ... the downside, a weak quarter, would probably take the stock back 15%-20%, as this is the minimum impact on earnings (that) weaker revenues would trigger.”Juniper stock is down 31% from its 32.39 high set Nov. 4, the day before Juniper's biggest rival, Cisco Systems (CSCO), entered into a ""strategic partnership"" with Ericsson. The announcement knocked Juniper out of Ericsson's sights as an acquisition target, although Ericsson said that it would continue to use some Juniper products.Juniper closed down 15.4% to 22.46 in the stock market today. Cisco stock closed down 1.4%.The weak Q1 2016 guidance that Juniper offered after Wednesday's market close was tied at least in part to foreign-exchange currency issues: ""Conservatism in the face of increased macro/FX concerns was the main reason for this adjustment,"" Jefferies analyst George Notter wrote in a research note Thursday.Juniper guided Q1 revenue to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.19 billion, up 6% from 2015's Q1. It guided Q1 EPS to a range of 42 to 46 cents minus items, vs. the 47 cents that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimated and that would represent a 47% jump from Q1 2015.""A bit confounding,"" Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a research note regarding Juniper's softer guidance. He added that F5 Networks (FFIV) ""cited top-down macro concerns in lowering guidance; Apple (AAPL) may also have overplayed macro in results.""Nomura rates Juniper stock a neutral with a 30 price target. Jefferies rates it as a hold but lowered its price target Thursday to 27.50 from 33.For Q4, Juniper earnings rose 54% from 2014's Q4 to 63 cents per share minus items, beating analysts by 3 cents, on revenue up 20% to $1.32 billion vs. Wall Street's $1.30 billion consensus. The recent Q4 benefited from a favorable comparison to 2014 when Q4 produced the only shrinking quarter for earnings in two years, down 5% from 2013.For 2015, Juniper's revenue rose 5% to $4.86 billion, or 7% adjusted for the sale of its Junos Pulse software in 2014. Earnings rose 40% to $2.03 per share minus items.""I'm pleased with how well we've diversified our customer base across multiple verticals and geographies, and improved our operations,"" Juniper CFO Robyn Denholm said in the company's earnings release. ""Our focus continues to be on our fundamentals: improving execution, continuing cost discipline and operational efficiency.""The company disclosed that Denholm had resigned effective with the 2015 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission but would stick around for ""several months."" Ken Miller, currently senior vice president of finance, will succeed her as CFO.""As a challenger in this industry, we plan to remain nimble, anticipate and deliver what our customers require for network innovation, and continue our relentless focus on execution to maximize long-term value for our shareholders,"" Juniper CEO Rami Rahim said in a statement.Top rival Cisco is by far the biggest player in IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, with a market value topping $117 billion vs. No. 2 Juniper's $8.6 billion. But Juniper has an IBD Composite Rating of 83, vs. Cisco's 63.

77,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) stock rocketed Thursday as the cybersecurity firm’s model of providing a simplified product boosted market-share gains and helped fiscal Q2 results as well as Q3 sales guidance top projections.For its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 31, Palo Alto’s earnings per share soared 110.5% to 40 cents, beating estimates by a penny. Sales jumped 54% to $334.7 million, above views of $318.3 million. Both measures, however, decelerated for the second consecutive quarter.Shares closed up 9.7% and rallied another 4% in after-hours trading.Customers aren’t interested in puzzle-piecing together their security solution, CEO Mark McLaughlin said on a conference call. That platform focus drove Palo Alto to add 2,000 new customers to its 30,000-strong client base. He also noted a “paradigm shift” from reactive security to the platform.“People are not interested in adding one more agent onto the endpoint,” he said. “So simplified on the endpoint is a driver and it’s very analogous to when people say, ‘Hey, I don’t want firewall and plus, plus, plus (more products).”Billings also surged 62% to $459 million during Q2 as customers began “buying all elements of our platform,” CFO Steffan Tomlinson said on the call.Subscription revenue of $84.3 million grew 68% vs. the year-ago quarter.“We’re seeing customers standardizing on our platform,” McLaughlin said. And with that, “they’re adopting a lot more subscription services than they have in the past.”Current-quarter sales guidance for $335 million-$339 million topped analyst forecasts for $334.9 million, but Palo Alto’s EPS ex items outlook for 41-42 cents missed Wall Street expectations for 45 cents.The company’s Q3 sales would be up 44% at the midpoint of guidance, and EPS ex items would rise 80% at the midpoint. But both metrics would also decelerate for the third consecutive quarter. On a seasonal basis, Q1 and Q3 tend to be weaker, Tomlinson said.While McLaughlin said security remains a top priority globally, IBD’s 41-company Computer Software-Security group has fallen 20% year to date. Over the same time period, Palo Alto Networks stock has lost 26%.McLaughlin acknowledged the stock shake-up — likely related to disappointing guidance from tech firms like Tableau (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD) — but said there’s nothing to indicate the macro environment will play out along stock market lines.Palo Alto also appears to be swiping market share from Cisco (CSCO), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), McLaughlin said.Of the $300 million in added 2015 revenue across the five vendors, Palo Alto accounted for $120 million.“The average is $58 million,” he said. “I think it’s very obvious we’re taking share from everyone in the space for the math to work out that way.”During Q2, Palo Alto also announced a data-sharing partnership with Proofpoint (PFPT), similar to a deepened IBM (IBM)-Check Point alliance unveiled Thursday. The Palo Alto-Proofpoint alliance will drive automated and coordinated protection across Palo Alto’s platform, Proofpoint’s targeted attack protection and SocialPatrol.Customers are fed up with cybersecurity vendors that try to monetize data threat intelligence, McLaughlin said.“The big picture is the way we monetize intelligence is in the platform itself,” he told analysts. “The more intelligence we have in the platform, the better job we do. And we have an insatiable desire for platform intelligence.”He added: “You better be able to take intelligence and put it in your platform, and do something with it. That’s where the value will lie.”

78,JNPR,"For individual investors who like to sell stocks short in bad markets, the head-and-shoulders pattern often provides a reliable entry. IBD founder William J. O'Neil observed in ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" that when identifying a top in a stock, ""head-and-shoulders patterns are among the most reliable.""Yet problems sometimes occur in interpretation.""If you have only a little knowledge of charts, you can misinterpret what is a correct head-and-shoulders top,"" O'Neil added. ""Many pros don't interpret the pattern properly. The right (second) shoulder must be slightly below the left shoulder.""Juniper Networks (JNPR) debuted on the stock market in mid-1999, just in time to ride a technology stock melt-up.A melt-up is a type of stock run-up that usually involves panic buying among investors who are afraid they are missing out on something big. It may occur without any stepped-up earnings to back up the euphoria. This is what happened in 1999-2000, when the market was an expanding balloon headed for a pop.In the quarter ended June 1999, Juniper reported an operating loss of $4.2 million vs. a loss of $7.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company was losing less money, which was progress but not ideal. Juniper would continue to lose money until the first quarter of 2000, the same time that the Nasdaq peaked, then sold off sharply.From a high in March 2000, Juniper dropped 55% in two months.Yet by this time Juniper was increasingly profitable. The company was on track to post a net profit of $147.9 million in 2000, enough to erase the net losses of the previous four years combined.The stock regrouped and thrust 249% higher from a May low to October.During the run-up, disciplined investors probably would've sold the stock for a triple-digit percentage gain at one of the dips below the 50-day line, especially if their original entry was October 1999, the first breakout at a 39.16 buy point.The right time to sell, though, isn't the right time to short a stock. It would be rare for those two situations to converge.As IBD observes in its ""Short Selling Home Study Program"": ""If an investor sells a stock on the way up — the proper strategy — the stock may often have further to rise. Shorting at that juncture could prove painful.""So when did the stock establish itself as a short? Juniper completed a head-and-shoulders pattern in December 2000.The left shoulder peaked at 181.25 (1). The right shoulder's high point was 168.50 (2). Note that the right shoulder was below the left shoulder, as it should be in a proper head-and-shoulders pattern.The low of the left shoulder was 118.06. Although the right shoulder dipped below that low several times, it was the wrong time to short — too obvious.The first correct short sale came around 114, when the stock regained and dived under the 10-week line.Another correct short sale occurred around 50 (3) after the stock regained the 10-week line, then broke under it.

79,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) gouged rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) during Q1, as Fortinet (FTNT) and Symantec (SYMC) demand toppled, according to a Piper Jaffray survey of 26 resellers and distributors.Meanwhile, cybersecurity vendors Imperva (IMPV) and FireEye (FEYE) improved on Q4 demand, and CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Proofpoint (PFPT) demand remained relatively stable.Cybersecurity stocks largely fell on the stock market today, with IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group down 1.1%.Proofpoint fell 3.6% and Fortinet 3.8% Tuesday. Palo Alto Networks stock was down 1%. Imperva was down 2.9%, and FireEye fell 1.3%.Bucking the trend somewhat, Symantec was flat, CyberArk up fractionally and Check Point rose 0.7%.Meanwhile, Cisco Systems rose 0.1% after initially selling off on Juniper Networks' (JNPR) weak preliminary guidance late Monday.Check Point is losing to Palo Alto Networks, according to resellers surveyed by Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski, but half of the resellers cited Cisco as the rival Palo Alto Networks beats out most frequently.""Cisco and Check Point have consistently been called out by resellers as the vendors most frequently losing to Palo Alto,"" Nowinski wrote in a research report. In Q4 and Q3, Juniper Networks was also cited by 13% and 18% of resellers as losing to Palo Alto Networks.""However, this is the first quarter resellers cited Fortinet as competition to Palo Alto, suggesting Fortinet may be moving more upstream into the mid-market enterprise space,"" Nowinski wrote.Only 35% of resellers sold more Palo Alto Networks products than they expected, Nowinski wrote, down from 56% in Q4. The largest distributors say Palo Alto Networks demand trends were unchanged, he added.Imperva jumped in Q1, as 20% of resellers were above plan vs. 8% in Q4. And FireEye demand improved to 31% below plan from 36% in Q4. CyberArk and Proofpoint were largely in line.But Fortinet and Symantec declined. In Q1, 31% of Fortinet resellers were below plan vs. 14% in Q4. Symantec fell to 50% below plan vs. 29% in the prior quarter.

80,JNPR,"Arista Networks' stock plummeted Monday after Jefferies lowered its price target, questioning the outlook for future sales to its No. 1 customer, Microsoft.Analyst George Notter, writing in a research report, reiterated Jefferies' underperform rating on Arista (ANET) and sharply lowered his price target to 40.25 from 52.50. He said Microsoft's SONiC ""announcements are troubling for Arista,"" referring to that company's software for open networking in the cloud.Arista stock was down more than 10%, near 56.50, in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, 35% off of a 16-month high hit in June. Arista shares -- which went public in June 2014 at 43 -- touched an all-time low of 52.59 on Feb. 9 of this year.Switching rival Juniper Networks (JNPR) was down 1.5% Monday afternoon, and and bigger competitor Cisco Systems (CSCO) was off a fraction, as Notter said they have less exposure than Arista to an anticipated decline in switching revenue with Internet content provider customers, though they too are exposed.In his research note Monday, Notter said last Wednesday's Linux-based Open Compute Project (OCP) Summit in San Jose, Calif., made Jefferies ""much more concerned about Arista's business at major customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL).""That's because Microsoft had just demonstrated SONiC, free software-defined networking (SDN) that makes high-speed switches unneeded. Cisco, Juniper and Arista all make such switches, but ""in Arista's case, the Web scale operators account for roughly 25% (or about $200 million) of the company's revenue stream -- all in switching,"" said Notter.He cited Cisco as saying ""several quarters ago"" that about 5% of its overall switching business, or ""roughly"" $700 million annually, comes from Internet content providers. For Juniper, it's about 20% (or $970 million) of total sales, Notter noted.""For us, the big 'wow' moment at the (OCP) show was our trip through Microsoft’s SONiC-themed booth,"" Notter wrote. ""We saw the operator demonstrating SONiC running on switch hardware from Arista, Juniper, Centec, Mellanox (MLNX) and Dell -- with different ASICs  (application-specific integrated circuits)   including Broadcom (AVGO), Barefoot Networks and Mellanox. The development of SONiC/ACS (Azure Cloud Switch) and SAI (switch abstraction interface) software now allows buyers to mix and match these components.""More pointedly, Arista is allowing Microsoft to use a hardware-only solution (i.e. without EOS, Arista's extensible operating system). Based on all the activity at Microsoft, it’s our view that -- over time -- all (or nearly all) of their switch deployments will migrate to white box hardware + SONiC.""He said Microsoft accounted for 12% of Arista's 2015 sales of $838 million.Wait, it gets worse: ""Microsoft noted that they are now running SONiC in their production environment (although we presume the extent of the deployment is still small). We understand that Microsoft plans to expand the software platform quite rapidly across all of their data centers,"" Jefferies' Notter said.What's bad for Arista may be good for Mellanox, however.""Separately, a number of industry contacts are saying that Microsoft is very interested in using Mellanox's Spectrum switching ASIC,"" Notter said.Mellanox stock was up a fraction Monday afternoon.Jefferies maintains hold ratings on Juniper and Mellanox and an underperform on Microsoft, but it rates Facebook stock a buy.Image provided by Shutterstock.

81,JNPR,"Tech giant Cisco Systems' (CSCO) 16-nanometer data center semiconductor could slug Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO), which is ramping its 28-nm Tomahawk technology, an RBC analyst said Monday.Broadcom's Tomahawk will go for $600-$700 per chip, replacing the outmoded Trident chip that costs less than $500, on average. Unlike Trident, however, Tomahawk won't win across-the-board vs. Cisco, RBC's Amit Daryanani wrote.Cisco recently unveiled its CloudScale application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), in direct competition with data center chipmakers Broadcom, Cavium (CAVM), Intel (INTC), Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).In the past, Broadcom's Trident won ""across the board"" at Cisco. This time, Cisco is likely to use its own CloudScale ASIC in its Nexus 9000, 9200 and 9300 platforms, leaving the 9500 to hold the Tomahawk silicon, Daryanani said.Other users include Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Arista Networks (ANET) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), which had a two-year head start to begin ramping Tomahawk-based solution, Daryanani wrote. He sees a five- to six-year lifespan for the product.Still, ""we believe Cisco encroachment into the merchant silicon market needs to be monitored by Broadcom investors,"" he wrote. ""For now, we continue to believe Broadcom's solutions are the market-leaders for cloud/data center spenders.""Daryanani maintained his 180 price target and top performer rating on Broadcom stock. Shares rose a fraction Monday, to 152.89, on a day when Apple released new products that didn't represent huge advances and were expected. Cisco stock fell a fraction on Wall Street Monday, while Apple was flat.

85,JNPR,"Facebook (FB) gained the support of AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) in a wide-ranging project to build large, low-cost computer data centers.AT&T, Verizon and several other international telecommunication companies joined the non-profit Open Compute Project, which Facebook launched five years ago. The goal is to design and build the most efficient server, storage and data center hardware with open-source software, designed to handle massive amount of data communications. The Open Compute Project could pose a threat to traditional communication hardware vendors that include Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).The Open Compute Project has focused on cloud computing and large-scale data projects, and it will now expand that to telecommunication centers.""AT&T will virtualize 75% of its network functions by 2020, and to do that, we need to move to a model of sophisticated software running on commodity hardware,” said Andre Fuetsch, senior vice president of architecture and design at AT&T, in a statement announcing the new members. ""We’re becoming a software and networking company,” he wrote. “As a result, our central offices are going to look a lot more like data centers as we evolve our networking infrastructure.”In addition to AT&T and Verizon, other telco companies joining the project include Germany-based Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) and South Korea's SK Telecom, while other members include Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and Goldman Sachs (GS).“We are optimistic about the potential of open hardware to bring large-scale gains to the telecommunications industry, and that starts with increased participation,” Jason Taylor, a vice president of infrastructure at Facebook, said in the announcement. Taylor is also chairman of the Open Compute Project.Three days ago Facebook announced its newest data center, to be built in Ireland.“All the racks, servers and other components have been designed and built from scratch as part of the Open Compute Project,” wrote Tom Furlong, also a Facebook vice president of infrastructure, in a blog post about the new data center. ""The facility will become part of the infrastructure that enables billions of people to connect with the people and things they care about on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and more,"" said Furlong.Facebook has also built data centers in Sweden and Prineville, Oregon.

86,JNPR,"One day before Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is slated to post fiscal Q1 earnings, the stock of half of the old computing pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co. rose 4.7% in the stock market today. The stock was doing what analysts expect it to do, outperforming the other half of the legacy company,  HP Inc. (HPQ), whose shares fell a fraction.The stocks, of course, reflect the market's interpretation of the companies' operational performance since splitting into two from the legacy corporation in November.  HP, which reported earnings last week, kept the PC and printer businesses -- and the old HPQ ticker. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the server, storage, networking, enterprise-software and cloud-migration businesses, seen as faster-growing endeavors, and kept the CEO, Meg Whitman (who in addition is chairwoman of HP Inc).Hardware and equipment-product sales comprise about 38% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise revenue, with services generating the rest.For the quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HPE to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1. The company reports after the market close.HP Inc.'s Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.For its first fiscal year ending in October, Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects EPS minus items of $1.85-$1.95, up from the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015, on revenue of $50.81 billion, down 2.5% from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015. Analysts have modeled $1.87 and $50.73 billion.""We like HPE because decent execution should be sufficient to move the stock higher,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a February research note.  ""We believe growth in servers, networking and storage, stabilization in high-margin technology services and continued improvement in the Enterprise Services margin should help close the gap between the current P/E of 7x and our target of 10x.""Storage head Manish Goel, as well as a few of our industry sources, say that HPE is taking business from Dell/EMC (EMC) during their proposed merge.  Still, we think it's time for Meg Whitman to provide a vision for the company. IBM (IBM) has cognitive computing.  What does hardware-heavy HPE want to be in 3-5 years and what will be its differentiation?""Nomura doesn't cover HPE, analyst James Chen advised IBD Wednesday, but he and colleague Jeffrey Kvaal are watching closely as HPE competes with companies that Nomura does cover, such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Arista Networks (ANET).Nomura said it expects 3% sales growth for HPE's enterprise group this fiscal year, compared with Cisco and Juniper's guidance ranges of 3% to 6%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise's ""projected growth rates are not likely to threaten networking incumbents, but don’t imply much share loss either,"" the Nomura analysts said in a research note.HPE's hybrid cloud business competes with IBM, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform services.Big Data startup Hortonworks (HDP), the Hadoop developer, on Tuesday said it would collaborate with HPE on the use of Apache Spark, making use of shared memory in HPE enterprise environments.UBS analyst Mulinovich, in his February note, said that ""upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock. . . .  Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock is 12.5% off its Dec. 1 record high of 15.88, while HP Inc. is 26.5% off its record high of 14.82, set Nov. 24.

87,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) last quarter again nabbed market share from rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), a Piper Jaffray analyst wrote Monday ahead of Palo Alto's fiscal Q2 earnings late Thursday.In a survey of third parties selling Palo Alto products, half said Palo Alto is most consistently beating out Check Point, Piper Jaffray's Andrew Nowinski wrote in a research report.""Cisco, Check Point and Juniper have consistently been called out by resellers as the vendors most frequently losing to Palo Alto,"" he wrote. ""These are also the top vendors in the firewall market, suggesting Palo Alto continues to gain share at the expense of all the major vendors in the space.""That's sure to rile Cisco, which last week unveiled a next-generation firewall in direct competition with Palo Alto, Check Point, Fortinet (FTNT) and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee. It was also the first time that Check Point was cited as the vendor Palo Alto beats most often, Nowinski wrote.Nowinski retained his rating on Palo Alto Networks stock to overweight, with a 208 price target. At least three other analysts, however, cut their price target on Palo Alto stock Monday ahead of the Thursday earnings report.Palo Alto stock rose 2.3% on the stock market today, but rival FireEye (FEYE) was up 9.4%. FireEye announced Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as its global alliance partner of the year.For fiscal Q2 ended in January, Palo Alto Networks is expected to report $318.3 million in sales and 39 cents earnings per share ex items, up 46% and 105%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. It would be its first quarter eclipsing the $300 million-mark.But sales and EPS minus items are expected to decelerate for the second consecutive quarter, according to the consensus of 40 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The consensus model is in line with Palo Alto's earlier guidance for $314 million to $318 million and 38 cents to 39 cents.Palo Alto stock is down 26% this year, slightly worse than IBD's 25-company Computer-Software Security industry group, which is 22% off its 2015 closure. Cybersecurity stocks were pounded in January on a perceived slowdown in spending after gloomy reports from firms like Tableau Software (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD).Neither Nowinski nor Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick see that slowdown for Palo Alto. Trebnick maintained her buy rating and 215 price target on Palo Alto stock. She urged investors to compare Palo Alto to direct next-generation firewall vendors.Barracuda Networks (CUDA), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT), Imperva (IMPV), Rapid7 (RPD), Qualys (QLYS), Splunk (SPLK) and FireEye ""have provided a seemingly negative read-through for Palo Alto Networks,"" Trebnick wrote in a research report. ""Unlike elsewhere in security, next-generation firewall vendors that cater to enterprises have all managed to produce good enough results for investors.""Trebnick expects Palo Alto to beat consensus expectations. Wildfire and Traps are driving higher attach rates, she wrote. Wildfire is Palo Alto's cloud-based malware-analysis system, which competes with FireEye.

88,JNPR,"Starting what almost surely will be its first year with revenue of $1 billion, Arista Networks (ANET) connected with buyers, who drove the stock up by double-digit percentages Friday, while sellers unplugged Alliance Fiber Optics (AFOP), its stock falling by double digits, after both companies reported Q4 earnings late Thursday. Guess which did better.Both companies compete with bigger computer networking product makers Juniper Networks (JNPR) and much bigger Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco stock was flat in early afternoon trading Friday, while Juniper was up 1%.Arista stock rose as much as 16% Friday and was up 11%, near 65, in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, still 27% off an eight-month high of 88.56 set June 24.Meanwhile, Alliance's Q4 results were hurt by cutbacks from its top customer, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. Alliance stock fell as much as 17% Friday, touching a nearly 16-month low, and was down 15% in early afternoon trading, near 12. It's 45% off a nearly two-year high set July 24 at 22.35.Helped by Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure public cloud, Arista said Q4 earnings jumped 51% to 80 cents per share minus items, as revenue rose 41.5% to $245.4 million. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 61 cents and $241 million. Arista provides a network operating system, data center storage and other products.
"
89,JNPR,"Arista's non-GAAP gross profit margin settled at 64%, near the high end of the 62%-65% range it had forecast, but that was down from the 67.4% in Q4 2014 and 69% in Q1 2014, said FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi in a research note.""Therefore, there is some downside risk on the (gross margin) line going forward,"" he wrote.Still, he and other analysts said Arista had solid momentum.Arista guided the Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to 62% to 65%, and revenue at $232 million to $240 million. Analysts expect Q1 EPS to rise 14% to 57 cents, on sales up 30% to $233.48 million.Reiterating Needham's buy rating with a 105 price target, analyst Alex Henderson said in a Friday research note that ""the news should only get better over 2016.""We think the shift to (faster-bandwidth) 25G architectures will accelerate Arista's share gains,"" he wrote. ""We think Arista could pick up 3-5 points of market share on a base of 12%, driving continued stronger-than-forecast growth. This company is best in breed.""Seyrafi had noted that when FBN began covering Arista in September 2014, ""one of the key bear points"" was that Microsoft revenue was ""quite robust,"" comprising 11% of total Arista sales, as Microsoft built out Azure. He thought, though, that revenue for Arista might decline after the buildout. Instead, Arista said 2015 revenue from Microsoft topped $100 million, 12% of total sales, ""so sales to MSFT do not appear to be slowing down,"" said Seyrafi.FBN retained its outperform rating with an 80 price target for Arista stock.So what's happening with little Alliance Fiber Optics, where adjusted EPS crashed 80% to 5 cents in Q4, while sales fell 13% to $16.4 million?Google ""plummeted from 45% of revenue to 20% in (Q4) as it sharply reduced inventory at the behest of its new (Alphabet/Google) CFO (Ruth Porat) and cut capex by 40%,"" said Needham's Henderson in a separate research note Friday.Alliance ""was caught in the crossfire,"" he said.""But all indications are that that's over. Google is expected to meaningfully increase spending in 2016, and the shift to 25G architectures should strongly improve AFOP's results. ... Despite the miss in (Q4), we are maintaining our 2016 and 2017  EPS estimates and reiterating our buy rating and 20 target price.""Needham expects adjusted EPS of $1.18 for 2016, up from  95 cents in 2015.Image provided by Shutterstock.

90,JNPR,"Proofpoint (PFPT) rebuffed Wall Street concerns that tech spending has slowed this quarter, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote Monday, following last week's 40,000-attendance cybersecurity RSA Conference in San Francisco.Fears of a tech spending depression slugged IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group after dismal outlooks by Tableau Software (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD) last month. The group hit a 20-month low on Feb. 9 but has since risen 31%.A weak spending outlook did not play out at RSA, Nowinski and William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote Monday in separate research reports.""(Proofpoint) management said they are seeing 'absolutely no change in the buying environment,'"" Nowinski wrote. ""Based on our meetings at the conference, we believe demand trends in Q1 have remained strong through the first two months of the year.""Trending buzzwords include endpoint security, internal access management and privileged account management, Nowinski wrote. Symantec (SYMC), FireEye (FEYE) and IBM (IBM) (via a partnership with Carbon Black) compete in the endpoint market.Industry tracker IDC sees endpoint security revenue reaching $4.6 billion in 2016, up 5.4% and accelerating from 2% year-over-year growth in 2015, Nowinski wrote.Despite a marketing refresh, Symantec will struggle against ""rapidly growing next-generation endpoint vendors that have demonstrated stronger solutions,"" Ho predicted. FireEye, on the other hand, bolstered its threat-prevention capabilities by adding exploit detection to its endpoint.IDC also expects internal access management revenue to reach $5.9 billion in 2016 and grow at an 8% compound annual growth rate through 2019. Within that sector, privileged account management will comprise $550 million, growing at a 10.6% CAGR over the next four years, Ho says.CyberArk Software (CYBR) rivals Centrify in the identity access management ring, Nowinski wrote. But Centrify's tools for securing both privileged accounts and end-user identity give it a broader portfolio than CyberArk, he wrote.During RSA, CyberArk released a new version of its privileged threat analytics system, aimed at stopping ""Golden Ticket"" attacks which exploit privileged credentials in Microsoft (MSFT) domain-level administrator accounts, Ho wrote.Ho also noted that a platform focus continues to buoy Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which he says still wins ""bake-offs"" against Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).But Check Point's software-based firewall could be a game changer, he wrote.""Check Point's software-based firewall appears better positioned than competitors for the upcoming shift to third-party cloud architectures such as AWS (Amazon (AMZN) Web Service) and (Microsoft) Azure,"" he said.Ultimately, the RSA Conference quelled concerns of slowing spending and lengthening sales cycles, Ho wrote. RSA saw 70 first-time exhibitors, giving it 500 companies at the event, and more than 20% growth from 33,000 attendees in 2015.""We observed continued excitement over the space and a strong appetite for new solutions, consistent with prior years,"" Ho wrote. ""Our discussions with private and public companies suggest that the environment remains robust and that security spending has not weakened near term.""Overall themes included the burgeoning Internet of Things market, encryption, third-party cloud security, identity/access management as-a-service, real-time visibility, next-generation endpoint security, automation/orchestration and leveraging Big Data analytics, Ho wrote.""The conference reinforced our view that the companies best positioned to benefit from increased spending are those that offer innovative next-generation approaches that will see rapid growth in investment,"" he wrote.Customers are looking at cost, manageability and vendor consolidation, Ho wrote.

"
94,JNPR,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock gapped down Friday to a six-week low after the company gave lower-than-expected guidance late Thursday, with investors not appeased as yet with CEO Chuck Robbins' message that better days are ahead.The company's earnings and sales for its fiscal Q1, ended Oct. 24, beat Wall Street expectations, but its Q2 guidance missed.""We're doing all the right things to drive our growth,"" CEO Chuck Robbins said on the company's earnings conference call. And he said those things would be more obvious in the ""coming months.""Just maybe not this month or next. Cisco guided the current-quarter earnings at 53 to 55 cents per share minus items, on revenue rising 0% to 2%. Analysts had modeled EPS up 6%, at 56 cents, and sales up 5%, to $12.55 billion.On the other hand, more than $1 billion in annual sales should accrue starting in 2018 from Cisco's ""strategic partnership"" with Ericsson (ERIC), Robbins had assured when he and Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg announced the partnership Monday.FBR analyst Daniel Ives pointed out in a research note Friday that Cisco's Q1 security segment revenue had risen 7% despite touch comparisons with the year-earlier figure. He called that a ""bright spot.""""The company's impressive turnaround on this segment after years of pain and on the shoulders of its SourceFire acquisition (in 2013) now appears to be hitting its stride, which we loudly applaud,"" Ives said.""We continue to point to massive strength in firewall spending and next-generation cybersecurity initiatives (unified threat management, endpoint, email, database security) heading into 2016, while 'emergency security spending' has ticked down, which clearly impacts FireEye (FEYE) more than any other vendor. Cisco security share gains have subsided as the company has finally figured out the right formula/better execution and now the focus is on identifying the winners in the land grab opportunity for this $30 billion cyberpie over the next three years.""Ives said FireEye and possibly Fortinet (FTNT) could be Cisco acquisition targets in 2016 ""for Robbins as he looks to significantly expand Cisco's security footprint in this fertile market for years to come.""Similarly, Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, which offers the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK) with Cisco as a top-10 holding, sees promise in Cisco's security products.""Investments in areas like cybersecurity for the firm have the potential to provide some more growth as opposed to its other, more mature business lines,"" Chanin told IBD Friday. ""It's a combination of them not just relying on their mature revenue-generating business units but expanding into those with more growth potential.""FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his outperform rating on Cisco stock but lowered his price target to 32 from 35, ""driven largely by uncertainty from macro (primarily outside the U.S.) and currency.""""Although data center revenue of $850 million basically met consensus, its growth (23% year over year) continues to be strong as Cisco continues to take share in the server market,"" Syrafi wrote in a research note.Cisco stock was down 6% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 26.Among Cisco's healthiest networking rivals, Juniper Networks (JNPR) stock was down 3% Friday afternoon. Ericsson stock was down 2%, near 9, and is off 9% since its Monday gain following the partnership disclosure with Cisco.

129,JNPR,"While investors applauded Hewlett Packard Enterprise's first quarterly performance as an independent company -- beating Wall Street estimates and driving its stock up more than 13% Friday -- some analysts and owners are pushing CEO Meg Whitman to compete harder.That means more aggressively taking on cloud enterprise leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), and buying up software  rivals such as Workday (WDAY) or Salesforce.com (CRM), rather than directing cash to shareholders.""I think we need to give Meg a chance to see if she can take advantage of the opportunities in servers with the cloud migration led by Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft on the service and software side,"" said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust, which holds 251,971 shares of HPE, in a Friday interview with IBD.""Further, the 54% year-over-year growth in the Q1 2016 quarter in networking allows HPE to build more momentum in this space"" vs. rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), he said.""And finally as we discussed before, the huge opportunity to expand the software unit with its 17%-plus operating margins (enables) a large acquisition in the cloud space. Right now software is just 8%-10% of total HPE revenues.""Buying enterprise software rivals Salesforce or Workday specifically is ""a chance to make that unit significant by bringing it up to 20%-25% of revenues,"" he said. ""Post-split, Hewlett Packard Enterprise was supposed to be the growth portion of the Hewlett-Packard Co., (creating) a reinvigorated growth company.""Nevertheless, happy with HPE's earnings performance issued after Thursday's market close, investors bid up its stock up 13.5% to close at 15.44 in the stock market today. That's less than 3% below its Dec. 1 high since splitting from its parent Nov. 1.For now, HPE stockholders interested in growth of any kind will need patience because the company is still shrinking, despite the slight Q1 beat.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, on sales down 3% to $12.72 billion vs. pro forma figures from a year earlier. The results slightly beat the average view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which called for EPS of 40 cents on sales of $12.68 billion. The non-GAAP 41 cents EPS is down from 47 cents a year earlier. (However, if HPE had been a standalone company at the time, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS would have been 44 cents, the company said in a March 1 note.)That's pretty much as planned, with HPE not projecting much growth until fiscal 2018. For Q2 ending in April, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q2 EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.297 billion before Thursday's earnings release, but on Friday, the revenue consensus was revised up to $12.332 billion.For the entire fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31,  analysts  polled by Thomson Reuters projected $1.87 EPS ex items for fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, on revenue revised up Friday to $50.805 billion. HPE earlier had modeled $50.81 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016, down 2.5% from a $52.12 billion pro forma in fiscal 2015.The slightly smaller half of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., now called HP Inc. (HPQ), kept the legacy PCs, printers and ticker. HP Inc. lifted 0.6% to 11.18 Friday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the enterprise software, servers, networking and financial services businesses.To encourage patience among Hewlett Packard Enterprise shareholders, CFO Tim Stonesifer said HPE will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1. In ""addition,"" Stonesifer said, shareholders will receive a ""majority"" of proceeds from the sale of a 51% stake in its Chinese server and storage business to Tsinghua Holdings, valued at $2.3 billion at the time the deal was announced last May. The transaction was supposed to be done by February, but Whitman said regulatory delays have pushed back closing to May, after which the cash will flow to shareholders.To UBS analyst Steve Milunovich, who complained in the post-earnings-release conference call that HPE shares were priced too low, Whitman chuckled: “We appreciate that, which is why we’re backing up the truck” to buy back more shares, which helps boost the price.Whitman advised analysts that by investing internally and encouraging organic growth “you don’t end up with a Frankenstein of architecture"" as the company would risk doing by  growing through acquisitions. She cited HPE for pursuing both paths.“Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT (Internet of Things), all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.” Aruba Networks is a networking leader in mobile enterprise that the old Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy last March for about $3 billion, strengthening the new HPE's rivalry with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks.As for ""taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace,"" Whitman said, ""we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's (IBM) sale of their server business to Lenovo. ... We have a big opportunity to go take (merging) Dell and EMC (EMC) business, much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo.”She told CNBC on Friday that ""in the last quarter, we had about 107 deals that we actually took from Dell/EMC.""She also told analysts that HPE has become the ""leading infrastructure provider for SAP (SAP) HANA (application server) with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor.”In the cloud, she said, ""following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials.”It just wasn't enough for Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who chided the company in a research note issued Friday, arguing that the $2.3 billion windfall from Tsinghua should be spent on organic or M&A growth, not shareholders' short-term benefit.""We had hoped that post-split, HPE would be able to focus on getting its house in order and leverage its cash and balance sheet to buy/invest in solutions that solve their product gaps,"" Kugele said. ""Instead, the company seems intent on continuing financial engineering by doubling its cash return to shareholders (including the pending Tsinghua cash). In our view, this creates no sustainable value for the company or its investors but merely provides a floor for the stock during a period of poor enterprise spending.""With no material growth, revenue improvement or product strategy to build a buy thesis around, we reiterate our hold rating on the stock.""Said Morgan, the Synovus Trust portfolio manager who wants to give Whitman time to execute: ""I did hear HPE management touting its share repurchases and FCF (free cash-flow) generation capability on the call. And this is very reminiscent of when Mark Hurd was leading HPQ  (the former Hewlett-Packard Co.) and grew the share price through financial engineering and not new product growth.""Hurd is now co-CEO of Oracle (ORCL), one of HPE's toughest software rivals, and another legacy giant growing slowly.

130,JNPR,"SAN FRANCISCO -- CyberArk (CYBR) CEO Udi Mokady surveyed the crowd. A man decked in a traditional Native American headdress passed the booth -- his movement highlighted by the nearby fire-truck-red semitrailer that Fortinet (FTNT) rolled in as its booth, and Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) towering blue signage.Tweeted photos show a bright orange fox touting social media security firm ZeroFOX. Open-source manager Black Duck Software handed out ""What the (Duck)"" T-shirts. And the entire event was overshadowed by a Terminator-Darth Vader mash-up mascot.""A lot of CEOs don't even walk the floor,"" Mokady told IBD at the annual cybersecurity RSA Conference in San Francisco's Moscone Center convention hall. ""But there are a lot of meetings that set the tone for the year, (there are) relationships happening behind closed doors.""If the RSA Conference sets the tone for the cybersecurity industry, 2016 will be marked by roaring noise -- mostly in marketing. But execs tend to agree the overarching themes for the year will center on technological leaps and possible collaboration.""Platform"" is a buzzword for a reason, Needham analyst Scott Zeller wrote in a research report after Palo Alto Networks last month crushed Wall Street's Q2 expectations. The broad-based platform approach works in security.But Palo Alto wasn't the only vendor lauding its platform-centric approach at the RSA Conference. An overwhelming majority of companies -- IBM (IBM), FireEye (FEYE) and Fortinet included -- touted their platforms.Consumers are confused, Fortinet threat researcher Derek Manky told IBD. That's where third-party testing comes into play. Fortinet calls it a ""security fabric,"" which integrates Fortinet's firewall with threat intelligence data from FortiGuard researchers.""We can say how good we are, but there are a lot of third-party vendors that are doing validation of security,"" he said.A recent test by NSS Labs ranked Fortinet's FortiGuard 3200D and Check Point Software Technology's (CHKP) 13800 NGFW Appliance as top products, blocking 99.6% of all exploits. The lab examined 13 leading products comprising 96% of the next-generation firewall market.Palo Alto Networks' PA-7050 scooted in with 95.9% effectiveness, trailing a Juniper Networks (JNPR) offering and two Cisco Systems (CSCO) products with a respective 98%, 96.5% and 96.3% scores.Confusion is lending itself to the advent of software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, former iSight Partners CEO John Watters told IBD. FireEye acquired iSight in January for $275 million and retained Watters and much of the iSight leadership team.Watters sees SaaS making a play for the platform market.""The big trends line is customers are moving from best-in-class niche product to best-in-class platform,"" he said. ""And they're moving from a self-serve model to an as-a-service model.""That shift benefits FireEye. New FireEye-as-a-Service billings nearly doubled in 2015 vs. 2014, CFO Michael Berry told analysts during the company's Q4 earnings conference call in February.Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Intel (INTC) Security and Symantec (SYMC) are leading a sector push to share threat intelligence data across the map. In 2014, the quartet became odd bedfellows in a security collaboration dubbed ""the Cyber Threat Alliance.""Davis Hake, Palo Alto Networks director of cybersecurity strategy, told IBD the group's goal is to reduce the noise generated by low-level, easy-to-launch attacks.""We take that data back out, and we work to democratize it with the rest of the security community,"" he said. ""It allows us to understand, across the community, attackers' game plans against all of these other entities.""Palo Alto Networks CEO Mark McLaughlin, on the company's recent earnings call, said the days of monetizing threat data are over. A company's value stems from its overall platform, he says.Watters disagrees: ""All the people that are driving sharing are people who don't have a bunch of intellectual property,"" he said. ""Everybody is filling up each other's in-boxes with all the same stuff. It's all the machine-generated event data.""ISight fits into a detection hole in FireEye's model, he explained.""We detect ... everything that leads up the time they hit enter on the keyboard,"" he said. ""As soon as they hit enter, we went blind because we didn't have attack surface monitoring.""FireEye's incident response leg, Mandiant, sees the attack itself, watching how hackers escalate privileges, jump firewalls and burrow through systems. ISight detects the attack prep and follows the fallout on the black market.That intelligence is proprietary, Watters said. Because of that, FireEye doesn't need to reboot its software every several years; the software is updated every hour. Fortinet makes a similar boast, noting its FortiGuard research updates systems every five minutes.Artificial intelligence (AI) won't look like Haley Joel Osment in the 2001 Steven Spielberg flick. Rather, machine-learning will be bolstered by data-heavy Internet of Things devices, Sol Cates, chief security officer for encryption specialist Vormetric, told IBD.The trend could boost the chip sector. Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) forged alliances with Facebook (FB) and Chinese Internet major Alibaba (BABA) during Q4 for speedy intelligence chips, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said during last month.Just as ""platform"" is a commonplace buzzword, so too are Big Data, the Internet of Things and the cloud, Cates says. But they'll also be integral to future technology -- and that's either a boon or a bust for the cybersecurity industry.AI generates two big questions for the sector, Cates said.""How do we protect the sensitive data going in? And how do we harness it for security?"" he asked. The problem is, the cybersecurity industry often trails innovation. ""We have to figure it out after the fact, and we're not yet experts on it.""IBM, which just acquired Resilient Systems, plans to push machine-learning to accelerate automated penetration testing, Marc van Zadelhoff, the company's security general manager, told IBD. Penetration testing -- purposefully probing a system for vulnerabilities -- will become more and more necessary in the security world as the BYOD (bring your own device) trend opens more endpoints.Gemalto exec David Etue argued during an RSA lecture that software updates could right the likely-to-occur wrongs as the cybersecurity sector tackles the Internet of Things market.""If we get this right, this puts us in a position for long-term success,"" he said.Fortinet's Manky says wrangling the Internet of Things and protecting Big Data will be more complicated than that. Industry experts estimate 20 billion-30 billion Internet-capable devices will come online in the next four years.""That generates a lot of noise, and there's a lot of traffic, you need to inspect all of that,"" Manky said. ""Anything and everything is a target now. ... If you think of any device that has an Internet connection, it's got memory, it has a processor and a connection, and that's all hackers need to go after (it).""

133,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) fiscal Q1 beat-and-raise late Monday came at the expense of rivals Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and FireEye (FEYE), analysts wrote Tuesday.Palo Alto Networks stock was rising for a seventh consecutive day, up 5% in midday trading in the stock market today, above 181. Shares hit an all-time high of 199 on July 24 and are up more than 45% this year.On Tuesday, at least seven analysts boosted their price targets on Palo Alto Networks stock. FBR analyst Daniel Ives called Palo Alto Networks' fiscal Q1 ""another rock-solid quarter"" and Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski noted that it was the company's 10th consecutive beat.For its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 31, Palo Alto Networks reported 35 cents earnings per share ex items on $297.2 million in sales, up 133% and 55%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period. Both measures broke a recent trend of acceleration but beat Wall Street expectations.Palo Alto Networks guided to $314 million to $318 million in current-quarter sales and 38-39 cents EPS. Sales and EPS would be up 45% and 102%, respectively, at the midpoints of guidance but would show slowing growth.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $310.6 million and 38 cents.Q3 billings jumped 61% year over year to $388 million, over the consensus forecast for $359.1 million.Upping The Ante Over RivalsDuring Q1, Palo Alto Networks replaced Check Point in a deal with one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world and beat out Cisco in a seven-figure global perimeter deal, CEO Mark McLaughlin told analysts on the company's earnings conference call.The PA-7080 data center firewall ""was the cornerstone"" of several large deals in Q1, and product revenue jumped 46% year over year to $147.7 million, McLaughlin said.Palo Alto Networks' WildFire, a cloud-based malware detection environment, added 1,000 new customers during Q1 and now has 8,000 globally. By comparison, FireEye's alternative to WildFire has 3,999 customers, Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wrote.Nowinski raised his price target on Palo Alto Networks stock to 208 from 200 and maintained his overweight rating.FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi said Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet (FTNT) gained the most market share during the October quarter, while Cisco and Juniper Networks (JNPR) lost the most.Seyrafi raised his price target on Palo Alto Networks stock to 215 and reiterated an outperform rating.Palo Alto Networks could be headed to No. 1, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote in a research report.""In our view, the framework for evaluating Palo Alto is likely to shift from market share gainer to scenarios in which the company can become potentially the largest vendor in the cybersecurity space, driven by its market share gains,"" he wrote.The lion's share of Palo Alto Networks' sales are derived from ""competitive displacements,"" rather than a refresh among its captive, installed base, Ho wrote.Ho rates Palo Alto Networks stock outperform. FBR's Ives raised his price target on Palo Alto Networks stock to 210 from 200 and also rates it outperform.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

137,JNPR,"Luxoft (LXFT) stock gapped up to a new high Wednesday after the tech service firm late Tuesday reported earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations.The third-party software developer also raised its fiscal 2016 guidance for profit and sales.Luxoft rose as much as 10% in the stockmarkettoday, above 77, and was up 7%, above 75, in afternoon trading.Luxoft reported second-quarter earnings minus items of 84 cents a share, up 45% from the year-earlier, smashing analyst expectations for 71 cents.Sales rose 29% to $161.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating Thomson Reuters analyst consensus of $159.9 million.Luxoft's annual sales growth hasn't been below 24% since the June 2013 quarter, and its EPS growth has exceeded 22% in all but two quarters since then, growth rates that would be the envy of much-bigger rivals IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).For fiscal '16 ending March 31, Luxoft raised its adjusted EPS guidance to at least $2.60 per share vs. $2.55 guided previously, on revenue up at least 24% to $645.5 million instead of the earlier 23% estimate. Analyst consensus suggests $2.76 EPS on $661.93 million for fiscal '16.Luxoft is among the healthiest in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, where only Tyler Technologies (TYL) and Virtusa (VRTU) share the best-possible 99 Composite Ratings with Luxoft.

"
165,JNPR,"""We were a disruptive company,"" said Palo Alto Chief Marketing Officer Rene Bonvanie in an interview with IBD. Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""
"

167,JNPR,"The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.
"
168,JNPR,"In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.
"
169,JNPR,"The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.

182,JNPR,"Based on a recently published Nomura survey of 30 security professionals asked about their buying plans for this year and next, Palo Alto and rival FireEye (FEYE) could be expected to gain the most in spending dollars.
"
183,JNPR,"The survey indicated that the No. 1 priority for security spending this year is for advanced persistent threat protection, which plays into Palo Alto's WildFire product. WildFire's customer base increased 140% by the fourth quarter vs. a year ago to more than 7,000.

"
195,JNPR,"In a recent research note, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said that Palo Alto's platform ""is increasingly resonating with customers"" and that demand for its products ""remains robust.""Big-box retailers, investment banks, health insurers, governments, universities: No enterprise seems immune from cyberattacks. That is bad news for victims, but it means more work for cybersecurity companies such as the fast-growing Palo Alto Networks (PANW).This year alone, hackers gained access to millions of personal records, including Social Security numbers from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and other personal data from Anthem (ANTM), one of the nation's largest health insurers. More than 30 million e-mail addresses were infamously stolen from extramarital-affairs website Ashley Madison.Even Apple (AAPL) got hacked: popular Chinese names in its App Store were infected with malicious software.And these were just high-profile examples this year. They followed a long list of headline-making breaches, including attacks on Sony Pictures (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD). Untold others suffered breaches outside the spotlight.""There will be more,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst with William Blair & Co.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks is one of the fastest growing of all the cybermilitia forces and claims to be the fastest growing in next-generation network firewall security.It launched its first next-generation network firewall security product in 2007 and has since expanded to encompass advanced threats, endpoints and the cloud. Meanwhile, it keeps enhancing existing products and rolling out new ones.Palo Alto competes with established names in network security such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software (CHKP), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Fortinet (FTNT).Disrupting The Legacy Players""We were a disruptive company,"" said Palo Alto Chief Marketing Officer Rene Bonvanie in an interview with IBD. Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""Palo Alto's next-generation firewall platform is still core to the company's mission: to make it safe for people working in private or public enterprises to use any application from any kind of device.The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.Next-generation firewall solutions have more and better defenses, including analytics, intrusion prevention and anti-malware to thwart ""lots of different bad things that affect your computer,"" he said.Legacy players are adapting, but it takes longer for big companies to change course than small ones. Meanwhile, Palo Alto is ""rapidly catching up"" to the leaders in network security, Cisco and Check Point, Bonvanie says.""We are now the third-largest player in the enterprise security market after Cisco and Check Point,"" he said, adding that his firm's share is around 9%.Palo Alto has been growing revenue more than 50% on average the last two years. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in July, revenue jumped 59% to $283.9 million, billings 69% to $393.6 million — both well above analysts' estimates.Excluding items, it earned 28 cents per share in Q4, 3 cents above views, up from 11 cents last year.Revenue is expected to slow some from a robust 50%-plus rate, but it's still seen growing in strong double-digit percentages.

220,JNPR,"Cisco Systems, about to end an era when its longtime CEO John Chambers steps down, continues to show some resilience. The No. 1 maker of computer networking equipment late Wednesday reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that edged analyst estimates, and gave guidance for the current quarter that was basically in line with views.Cisco's (CSCO) prior earnings report in February also beat views.Cisco stock fell a fraction in after-hours trading. Shares rose 0.4% in Wednesday's regular session to 29.35.The San Jose, Calif.-based company is undergoing a transition that involves focusing more on emerging growth areas, including products and services for data centers, wireless networks and security, to offset slowing growth for its core network routers and switches.The company's newer product areas also include Software Defined Networking, where software takes the lead role in managing company information networks. And a year ago, Cisco said it would invest $1 billion over the next two years in building up its cloud services for customers.On May 4, Cisco said 18-year company veteran Chuck Robbins, senior vice president of worldwide operations, will replace Chambers as chief executive starting July 26. Chambers, who has led the company since 1995, will become executive chairman.Equipment makers such as Juniper Networks (JNPR) and F5 Networks (FFIV) also have posted better-than-expected quarters this year.

Revenue rose 5.1% to $12.1 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled 53 cents and $12.06 billion.For the current quarter, Cisco predicted adjusted EPS of 55-57 cents on revenue of $12.48 billion to $12.73 billion.Analysts had forecast 56 cents EPS on sales of $12.59 billion.Cautious guidance was expected, White says.""You are going to hear a little more conservatism with your guidance because you don't want to have (Robbins) come in and have the company miss,"" he said.In the conference call with analysts, Chambers said Cisco continues to perform well in a tough global market, including emerging markets such as China and Russia, and a tough foreign exchange environment.""Across every market and every industry we are moving from the information age to the digital age and the pace of change is only accelerating,"" he said. ""Our vision and strategy are working as every company, city and country becomes digital. They are realizing that Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations.""For Q3, product revenue rose 5.7% to $9.32 billion and services revenue rose 3.1% to $2.81 billion.Router sales rose 3.8% to $2 billion and switching equipment sales rose 5.7% to $3.56 billion. Switches and routers combined for 60% of total product revenue.Data-center gear sales outpaced that growth, rising 21%, but still totaled just $801 million.But new products, including the company's SDN package, called ACI, are starting to gain traction, White says.Meanwhile, FireEye (FEYE)fell 3.4% late after Chambers shot down takeover talk. The network security firm's stock closed up 5.2%.

235,JNPR,"Juniper Networks (JNPR) announced late Monday that chief executive Shaygan Kheradpir resigned and will be replaced by Rami Rahim, a 17-year veteran at the computer networking gear maker.
"
236,JNPR,"Rahim most recently served as Juniper's head of development and innovation. Kheradpir had been Juniper's CEO for just over 10 months.
"
237,JNPR,"Kheradpir resigned following ""a review by the board of directors of his leadership and his conduct in connection with a particular negotiation with a customer,"" Juniper said in a statement. Juniper said the board's review will not result in any adjustments to the company's financial statements.
"
238,JNPR,"Before joining Juniper in January, Kheradpir had been chief technology officer at Barclays and CTO at Verizon Communications (VZ).
"
239,JNPR,"Rahim had been running Juniper's routing and switching businesses.
"
240,JNPR,"Juniper shares were little changed in early pre-market trading Tuesday on the stock market today
"
241,JNPR,"""Ultimately, we see this as an indictment of Juniper's board,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair & Co. analyst in a report. ""After conducting a CEO search process in late 2013 that yielded an outside candidate, Juniper will undergo its second leadership transition in under 12 months. While the company's strategy does not appear to be changing in any material way, the situation is certainly unsettling. Still, with Rami Rahim —a long-time, respected Juniper veteran and top-level executive — stepping in, we have little reason to alter our view of Juniper from an operational perspective.""
"
242,JNPR,"George Notter, a Jefferies analyst said in a report: ""The CEO change is positive, but the top line picture at Juniper remains difficult — perhaps even more so in light of AT&T's (T) recent announcement that their 2015 capital budget will be $18 billion (down from roughly $21 billion in 2015). Moreover, an increasing portion of (Juniper's) earnings power comes from un-sustainable sources (share repurchases and ongoing cost restructuring).""
"
243,JNPR,"Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst said: ""The hiring of Rami as CEO could signal a new direction for the company as both Shaygan and previous CEO Kevin Johnson were outsiders. As a long-time Juniper employee, Rami's hiring is likely to be well received internally as he is well versed in Juniper's culture and also its product portfolio and roadmap, given his prior role as executive vice president and general manager. However, it remains unclear to us as to why Rami was not named CEO a year ago.""Juniper Networks (JNPR) announced late Monday that chief executive Shaygan Kheradpir resigned and will be replaced by Rami Rahim, a 17-year veteran at the computer networking gear maker.Rahim most recently served as Juniper's head of development and innovation. Kheradpir had been Juniper's CEO for just over 10 months.Kheradpir resigned following ""a review by the board of directors of his leadership and his conduct in connection with a particular negotiation with a customer,"" Juniper said in a statement. Juniper said the board's review will not result in any adjustments to the company's financial statements.Before joining Juniper in January, Kheradpir had been chief technology officer at Barclays and CTO at Verizon Communications (VZ).Rahim had been running Juniper's routing and switching businesses.Juniper shares were little changed in early pre-market trading Tuesday on the stock market today""Ultimately, we see this as an indictment of Juniper's board,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair & Co. analyst in a report. ""After conducting a CEO search process in late 2013 that yielded an outside candidate, Juniper will undergo its second leadership transition in under 12 months. While the company's strategy does not appear to be changing in any material way, the situation is certainly unsettling. Still, with Rami Rahim —a long-time, respected Juniper veteran and top-level executive — stepping in, we have little reason to alter our view of Juniper from an operational perspective.""George Notter, a Jefferies analyst said in a report: ""The CEO change is positive, but the top line picture at Juniper remains difficult — perhaps even more so in light of AT&T's (T) recent announcement that their 2015 capital budget will be $18 billion (down from roughly $21 billion in 2015). Moreover, an increasing portion of (Juniper's) earnings power comes from un-sustainable sources (share repurchases and ongoing cost restructuring).""Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst said: ""The hiring of Rami as CEO could signal a new direction for the company as both Shaygan and previous CEO Kevin Johnson were outsiders.

246,JNPR,"The cloud computing trend has become a rainmaker for investors in Arista Networks, which went public in June and whose stock has doubled from its IPO price.
"
247,JNPR,"Arista (ANET) makes cloud networking equipment that manages data traffic between Internet users and the data centers for big customers such as Facebook (FB), Yahoo (YHOO), Microsoft (MSFT) and eBay (EBAY).
"
248,JNPR,"The more users such companies sign up, and the more they do online, the greater the demand for the kind of gear Arista produces.
"
249,JNPR,"""Arista makes equipment that provides the infrastructure for Web 2.0 companies like Google (GOOGL) or Facebook to build their clouds on,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Inder Singh. ""Arguably, they make some of the world's fastest switching equipment. These guys have an edge in high-speed switching.""
"
250,JNPR,"Internet giants aren't the only ones in need of what Arista makes. Singh expects that in the next five to 10 years, demand for high-speed switching equipment will expand to include many new end markets such as health care, media and the oil and gas markets.
"
251,JNPR,"""I think we are seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of demand for high-speed networks today, with more and more of these other parts of the economy embracing the technology over the next five years,"" Singh said.
"
252,JNPR,"Switching Traffic
"
253,JNPR,"Cloud-computing data centers have thousands of servers and storage systems connected by optical-fiber lines, routers and switches that can distribute software apps and data quickly across the Internet and wireless networks to smartphones, tablets and PCs.
"
254,JNPR,"Arista's core product line consists of high-speed ethernet switches used to connect servers and other devices into a computer network so applications can be quickly deployed and cost-effectively updated, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"
255,JNPR,"Its switching products incorporate its Extensible Operating System, or EOS software, which the company says is ""fully programmable and highly modular.""
"
256,JNPR,"The ""programmability"" of EOS has enabled Arista to create software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation and network analytics, and help customers quickly integrate a wide range of apps, according to the SEC filing.
"
257,JNPR,"The company declined to comment, with spokeswoman Amanda Jaramillo noting that Arista is still in a quiet period.
"
258,JNPR,"Arista's biggest competitors are Cisco Systems (CSCO), the No. 1 provider of ethernet switches, and No. 2 Juniper Networks (JNPR).
"
259,JNPR,"But Arista's differentiated technology is among the reasons investors like the stock, and it's why the company has successfully competed against Cisco and Juniper, analysts say.
"
260,JNPR,"""Arista is one of the fastest growing companies in the networking market. They approach the switching market differently than their competitors and they've been taking market share,"" Singh said. ""That's appealing to investors.""
"
261,JNPR,"Arista's approach differs from rivals in a few ways.
"
262,JNPR,"The point that its EOS operating system is programmable makes it more flexible than ethernet switches from other companies, says Singh.

270,JNPR,"While Cisco is ""by far"" the market share leader, ""increasingly Arista is really taking market share,"" said Singh, noting that Arista is the No. 3 player behind Juniper.

"
272,JNPR,"""They are not a one-trick pony,"" said Singh. ""They have an entire portfolio of switching products.

Sonus plans to provide more details about its cost-cutting plans when it reports Q1 earnings results on April 22.Sonus, with about $300 million in annual revenue, was among the first to market more than a decade ago with packet-based networking, which bundled data into packets.But it's had a harder time competing with industry giants such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) in the hot wireless networks market.On Monday, Wunderlich Securities cut its price target on Sonus to 17 from 22, saying that it expects growth amid demand from large companies and service providers but in further-out quarters.Sonus shares gapped down 31% on the stock market today. The stock has plunged 56% so far this year, and revenue growth has fallen in the last four quarters from 12% to 9%, 8% and 1% last quarter.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

322,JNPR,"You may not notice the difference in your cellphone conversations or the look of Internet content on your computer screens. But fundamental changes taking place in many of the structural components of telecom networks is flashing some positive signals — and raising critical challenges — for makers of fiber-optic telecom gear. The changes come with labels like NFV, SDN, 100G…
"
323,JNPR,"Hewlett-Packard showed some muscle in the fledgling Network Functions Virtualization market by beating Cisco Systems, VMware and others in signing telecom carrier Telefonica to a multiyear pact.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is one of several tech giants scrambling to offer NFV, a virtualization computing system that relies more on software than hardware to help service providers speed an increasing amount of data through their networks at a reduced cost.Besides Cisco Systems (CSCO) and VMware (VMW), other NFV providers include Juniper Networks (JNPR).HP will fuel Telefonica's Unica project. Telefonica is moving all of its services, including Internet and mobile, to a new platform driven by NFV and software-defined networking, another technology system where software presides over hardware. The project will take several years.Spain-based Telefonica (TEF) is a large telecom operating in 21 countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America.HP is stepping up its NFV efforts, launched only last year, as the company gets closer to splitting into two separate companies. One will focus on PCs and printers, the other on enterprise products and services.Signing Telefonica should boost HP's revenue and set a bar for rivals in the NFV market, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""It's a nice win in advance of the split,"" Del Prete told IBD. ""Carriers are going to be moving more toward these network functions and virtualization environments. This is a big industry shift that is going to be measured in billions.""UBS on Tuesday upgraded HP to buy from neutral and hiked its 12-month price target to 40 from 37.25. HP stock is trading near 33. In a research report, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said, ""(HP Enterprise is) too hardware-dependent but improving. Software and services need to pick up, or HP Enterprise might be forced to merge with another larger computing vendor.""With the Telefonica contract, HP has seemingly leapfrogged rivals in what looks to be a very large market, says Roz Roseboro, an analyst for Heavy Reading, a market research firm that focuses solely on the telecom market.""From an endorsement standpoint, it's very big,"" she told IBD. ""The market right now is very much up in the air in terms of who is going to end up in the lead position with all of this NFV transformation.""HP provides NFV services for several customers, but Telefonica is a milestone for the company, says Saar Gillai, general manager of HP's NFV program.""This is our biggest deal in terms of providing end-to-end capabilities across our entire portfolio with open NFV,"" he told IBD.Not all of HP's rivals can handle such a large NFV migration, Gillai says.""We are uniquely positioned in this space because a lot of the traditional vendors are playing defense — they have a lot of existing systems that are in the old architecture, and they are not necessarily that motivated to get the new architecture that quickly,"" he said.Other vendors, such as Cisco, are stepping up their efforts in the NFV and SDN markets, said Amitabh Passi, an analyst for UBS Securities, in a March 2 research report.""Unlike years past, Cisco is more openly embracing shifts to software defined networking and Network Functions Virtualization, and in fact accelerating the shift to software and cloud services,"" he wrote.Several other telecom carriers, including AT&T (T) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), are in the process of adopting NFV.Reducing costs and streamlining networks are top priorities, says Roseboro.""They are moving from a world where you have lots of different boxes that are specialized to do one thing and moving all of that onto more commodity servers, which allows you to lower your capex,"" she said. ""And once it's virtualized, you can start using some other kind of IT tools to automate a lot of your processes and reduce your opex quite significantly.""Gillai declined to put a value on the Telefonica contract.""I can say that it's meaningful revenue, and it's also an indicator of things to come,"" he said.HP's revenue needs a boost. In the quarter ended Jan. 31, its enterprise revenue was flat with the year-earlier quarter, at $6.98 billion. And its enterprise services revenue fell 11% to $4.99 billion.

"
325,JNPR,"Known for network firewalls and other corporate security offerings, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) makes the IBD Leaderboard list of high-potential stocks. On Monday, it pushed up more than 3% to 83.85.
"
326,JNPR,"""PANW remains a top pick for 2014, our favorite play on the secular trend toward consolidated network-security functionality,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in an early-Monday research note boosting his price target to 105.
"
327,JNPR,"Weiss says several factors, including corporate security purchasing plans, bolster his confidence that the company can sustain 30% or better billings growth in fiscal 2015. He also notes that the company will see slower growth in capital expenditures and a reduction in litigation expenses.
"
328,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks offers a next-generation network-security platform used by enterprises, service providers and government entities to protect their networks from viruses, malware and other threats. Its lineup includes network firewall software and hardware. It also sells subscription services for threat detection and prevention, web filtering and mobile device security.
"
329,JNPR,"Patent Issue Past
"
330,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks stock is up 46% this year and 21% since the firm announced the end of a legal saga May 28 and released third-quarter fiscal 2014 results. They topped estimates with 49% year-over-year revenue growth to $150.7 million, and 57% earnings growth to 11 cents a share.
"
331,JNPR,"""These results were driven by continued strong product demand, robust service growth and a rapid market-share gain in the large and growing strategic enterprise security market,"" CEO Mark McLaughlin said on a call with analysts at the time, noting the firm had ""settled all existing litigation with Juniper.""
"
332,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks paid $175 million to settle a suit in which Juniper Networks (JNPR) claimed that Palo Alto Networks products infringed on six of its patents. Under terms of the deal, Palo Alto Networks agreed to make a one-time payment of $75 million in cash and pay $100 million in shares of common stock and warrants to buy common stock.
"
333,JNPR,"Juniper Networks filed the suit in December 2011. Palo Alto Networks later accused the company of infringing on three of its patents. As part of the settlement, the two firms agreed to license the patents at issue to each other and not file infringement suits for the next eight years.
"
334,JNPR,"""As we said from the beginning of this case, we do not believe that we infringed on any Juniper patents, and we still believe this to be the case,"" McLaughlin said on the Q3 call. ""However, over the course of the last 2-1/2 years, we've spent a large amount of time, money and other resources on this litigation. ... We believe that this outcome will allow us to continue to focus our efforts in what we do best: innovating and developing new products, servicing our customers and the growth that results from that.""
"
335,JNPR,"Although $175 million is a hefty sum for a company with less than $400 million in revenue as recently as its last fiscal year, the settlement did remove ""a key overhang"" on Palo Alto Networks stock, says FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi.
"
336,JNPR,"Stock Sets New High
"
337,JNPR,"With the overhang gone, Palo Alto Networks stock, which debuted in an IPO two years ago, hit a record high of 82.27 on June 17 and then passed that by almost 2% Monday.
"
338,JNPR,"The settlement is also seen resolving hesitancy on the part of some customers to do business with Palo Alto Networks as long as the lawsuit was up in the air.
"
339,JNPR,"""With this removal, we think Palo Alto can experience incrementally more sales,"" Seyrafi noted.
"
340,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks seeks to continue expanding an operation that already includes 16,000-plus customers in more than 120 countries across multiple industries. One potential growth area is in the enterprise market, where it looks to win business with a next-generation security firewall designed for corporate data centers.
"
341,JNPR,"Guard For Data Centers
"
342,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks' new PA-7050 security appliance will help it gain market share in the enterprise market, analysts predict. The product, launched in February, provides up to 120 gigabits per second of throughput speed to analyze threats to corporate data centers.
"
343,JNPR,"""Palo Alto has plenty of room left to take share in enterprise network security,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Rob Owens wrote in a report. ""Data-center deployments account for over 30% of Palo Alto's product revenue, and the release of the PA-7050 appliance expands the opportunity into even higher-performance environments.""
"
344,JNPR,"Meanwhile, analysts praise Palo Alto Networks' ability to win new business in a competitive field that includes pure plays such as Juniper, Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), plus broader hardware and software firms such as Cisco Systems (CSCO).
"
345,JNPR,"""Palo Alto is the clear market leader and is defining the market in the next-generation firewall space,"" Citi Investment Research analyst Walter Pritchard noted. ""With clear differentiation and technology leadership, we see continued share gains ahead for Palo Alto.""
"
346,JNPR,"Among factors working for Palo Alto Networks' potential, Morgan Stanley analyst Weiss notes that 43% of corporate security executives polled plan a firewall refresh (upgrades and replacements) this year vs. 23% last year. And with only 10% using Palo Alto for their primary firewall and/or unified threat-management needs now, he sees room for market share gains.
"
347,JNPR,"Weiss says the company has strong positioning and an improving margin trend past fiscal 2015.
"
348,JNPR,"More Acquisitions Ahead?
"
349,JNPR,"As Palo Alto Networks gains size, it may also eye more buyouts as a way to expand its piece of the pie, analysts say. The firm has not made a huge number of deals through the years, though it has made a couple in 2014. In January, it acquired Morta Security, a Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity company, for an undisclosed sum. In April, it completed its $200 million buyout of Cyvera, a privately held cybersecurity company in Tel Aviv, Israel.
"
350,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks might be set for more acquisitions after its recent decision to issue $500 million of convertible senior notes due in 2019. In a research note, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said Palo Alto intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.
"
351,JNPR,"""We believe the funds from the convertible offering would provide the company with significant latitude to further broaden its technology and next-generation security-solution suite, as it did with its recent acquisition of Cyvera to enter the endpoint-protection space in what we view to be a very positive fashion,"" Ho said.

354,JNPR,"In its ""Global Application & Network Security Report"" for 2014-15, Radware called 2014 ""a watershed year"" for the cybersecurity industry, one in which cyberattacks ""reached a tipping point"" in terms of their quantity, length, complexity and targets.Radware (RDWR) should know. It provides integrated application delivery and network security hardware for enterprises ranging from banks and insurers to manufacturers, retailers, telecoms, government agencies, media firms and service providers.The company's core product provides load balancing, traffic management, application performance monitoring and network security. Its website boasts that it offers ""complete security of business critical applications"" for around 10,000 enterprises and carriers worldwide. Its partners include Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).In addition to helping businesses improve productivity and profitability, and lower IT operating and infrastructure costs, Radware's cybersecurity and application delivery solutions are designed to help customers secure and manage network traffic.Safety Is SellingThe security end of the business has become ""a very hot market"" for Radware, says Chief Financial Officer Meir Moshe.""President Obama even talked about how this is a nationwide challenge following the attack on Sony, which he said came in from North Korea,"" Moshe told IBD in a phone interview from his Tel Aviv office. ""Companies need to be protected against cybersecurity attacks, and so we've seen an acceleration of growth in this market.""Radware's technology is designed to recognize potential threats in a network's traffic and block them before they have a chance to do any damage, Moshe says. That requires sophisticated gear that can analyze anomalies in traffic so that ""only legitimate traffic"" flows into the network.One such product, a new version of Radware's DefensePro platform, was launched this month. It is designed to help high-end cloud service providers mitigate sophisticated attacks by providing more security capacity.""Security in the cloud is our main focus for 2015,"" Moshe said. ""We have put a lot of resources into this because it is a very high-demand and growing market.""Analysts likewise have a bullish outlook on the cybersecurity market, as well as Radware's growth opportunities in it.New ServicesIn a research note, Imperial Capital analyst Michael Kim said he anticipates ""continued strong growth driven by increasing demand"" for Radware's security solutions.""We see particular opportunities for broadening deployments of application security and data center protection solutions, with potential upside from new cloud security services — e.g., managed attack mitigation and web application firewall,"" Kim noted.Buckingham Research analyst Rohit Chopra calls Radware ""one of the most compelling hybrid ways to play strong secular trends in security.""He expects Radware to increase R&D; and other spending as a way to capture new cybersecurity opportunities as well as prepare for a new partnership with a still-unnamed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that Chopra says will likely be a ""large networking provider.""Partnership PlanningMoshe would not divulge the name of the OEM, though he did confirm that the OEM will be identified during the second quarter and that revenue from the relationship will start coming in during the second half of the year.Financially, Radware continues to bounce back from a sluggish 2013, when it reported lower earnings and only a slight increase in sales. Part of the problem then was fierce competition that drove down prices, Moshe says.Thanks to a bigger emphasis on higher-margin security products, Radware has now posted four straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth, the first time that's happened since 2012.On Jan. 28, Radware reported fourth-quarter earnings of 28 cents a share, up from 22 cents a year earlier and a penny above the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 15% to $61 million, also slightly above estimates.The company's operating margins expanded to 22% at the end of 2014 from 14% at the end of the year.Radware's stock price sank 12% to 19.72 after it guided Q1 sales and earnings at the low end of analyst expectations. Shares have since regained some ground and currently trade near 22.For the full year, Radware's EPS grew 25% to 86 cents while revenue climbed 15% to $222 million — the biggest annual top-line gain since 2011.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Radware to increase 2015 earnings by 20% to $1.03 a share and revenue by 12% to $247.9 million.""By focusing on high-performance capabilities, tight integration of multiple services and multiple deployment options, Radware is carving out a defensible portion of the application delivery assurance market,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Mark Kelleher noted in a research report.He reckons Radware's ""continued innovation"" will let the company ""expand its addressable market and maintain mid-teens top-line growth for at least the next three years.""Radware has an IBD Composite Rating of 95, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. It belongs to IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, which ranks No. 45 in performance among 197 tracked.Radware is the top-rated stock in the group. Other high-rated stocks in the group include QLogic (QLGC), Arista Networks (ANET) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).

Cisco.Cisco Systems (CSCO) faces difficult product transitions that might enable smaller rivals to gain market share, says Barclays, which downgraded Cisco stock to equal weight from overweight.Barclays also noted in a research note Tuesday that Cisco has no apparent plans to exit unattractive or non-core businesses.Cisco stock fell a fraction to 21.45 near midday in the stock market today, but it's down nearly 20% since August and fell 11% in November, after Cisco lowered its outlook.Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes also lowered his price target on the stock to 23 from 25.""Given that well over half of Cisco's product revenue comes from routing and switching, we believe execution on large product transitions in both of these segments is critical to a revenue and margin recovery,"" Reitzes wrote. ""We believe revenue and EPS estimates for the next two quarters or so are achievable, with slight upside potential given backlog trends. However ... we are detecting more momentum with emerging, private players and others like Juniper (Networks) (JNPR), F5 Networks (FFIV) and Aruba (Networks) (ARUN).""Cisco's dividend yield should support shares in the low-20 range, says the Barclays analyst.Cisco appears unlikely to divest its cable TV set-top box business, says Reitzes. Google (GOOG) last year sold its ""Motorola Home"" set-top TV business to Arris Group (ARRS) for $2.35 billion.""It feels like (Cisco) remains particularly committed to its STB business — perhaps its most secularly challenged — given the strategic value to large cable customers that buy other products from Cisco,"" Reitzes wrote.RELATED: Aruba Q2 Beats On Market Share Gains Vs.

435,JNPR,"Software-defined networking is moving to the big bucks stage.Annual global spending by Internet, telecom and other service providers on SDN systems — where software takes a more prominent role in network management — will soar above $15 billion in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate above 90%, says a new study.The findings by ACG Research, released last month, track above two separate estimates of SDN spending by the other main buyers of the technology, enterprises.The ACG report is good news for companies moving fast into SDN, including VMware (VMW), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), as well as a rising number of startups, says Paul Parker-Johnson, ACG's practice leader.""Cisco, Juniper, VMware and Alcatel Lucent (ALU), and to some degree even Red Hat (RHT) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), may be players, and it's also going to be a mixture of brand-new companies that have made the transition,"" he said.In 2018, ACG says, service provider spending on SDN systems will reach $15.6 billion, up from $626 million last year.No other projections of service provider SDN spending could be found, but two outfits have projectted SDN spending by enterprises.Market tracker IDC pegged annual global SDN spending by enterprise companies at $3.7 billion in 2016, while Pacific Crest Securities forecast $2.2 billion in spending that year. The ACG study has service provider SDN spending in 2016 at $3.9 billion, with a 146% jump forecast for 2017 and another 62.5% rise in 2018.Service providers might be the most demanding market because they answer to a wide range of consumer and business customers, says Parker-Johnson. For them, the need for speed is perpetual.""There is no observable sign that we are decreasing the amount of applications we want to consume — people want their video when they want it and they want their news when they want it,"" he said.IDC analyst Rohit Mehra says the projection is higher than he would have expected. Service providers usually lag enterprises ""in terms of changing infrastructures and technologies,"" he said. ""If you combine the telecom routers and the switches and the optical and the wireless gear globally, $15 billion sounds a little high to me, but it's not out of the ball park.""SDN is billed as providing a more flexible network that can move data faster and more efficiently than before. It requires a combination of hardware and software to be effective, says Parker-Johnson.The vendors pursuing SDN ""are providing really elegant software to enable the applications at the controller level, and so a company like Juniper or Cisco is going to be making money off both the software and the hardware,"" he said.As data and cloud computing explode, service providers need ever faster and more flexible networksAnother challenge for service providers is keeping up with mobile users and apps, Parker-Johnson says. ""It's causing the operators to look for ways to scale up their networks,"" he said.Less Than $1 Billion This YearThe ACG study projects service provider SDN spending at $777 million this year, jumping to $1.67 billion in 2015, $3.9 billion in 2016 and $9.6 billion in 2017.Sales will accelerate as more service providers realize they need to upgrade their hardware to better accommodate SDN software, Parker-Johnson says.""The reason the growth is so steep is that the application providers and the Internet service providers not only want to deliver their applications and use this really cool software that is controlling the infrastructure, they are also going to be buying switches and routers that are being evolved so they can work with SDN,"" he said.Cisco, VMware and Juniper will also be competing with Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) in SDN revenues, says Parker-Johnson. ""You have some international firms from a network infrastructure point of view going hard after SDN and network virtualization for mobile infrastructures,"" he said.Last year, Cisco developed its first SDN hardware and software products and expects to start shipping them soon. Some analysts have said SDN could hurt Cisco, Juniper and other networking hardware makers. Parker-Johnson says the ACG study suggests otherwise.IDC's Mehra says the jury is out until at least 2015. It's too early to expect SDN to become a revenue boon for companies like Cisco and Juniper overnight, he says.""Many customers are still in the process of sorting out what SDN means to them, so there is not necessarily hundreds of millions of dollars in deals that Cisco would get for SDN,"" Mehra said.

534,JNPR,"Maybe RSA Security should have changed the R in its name to N when referring to its big conference in San Francisco this week.The RSA Security Conference, which wraps up Friday with a keynote delivered by, of all people, Stephen Colbert, has been dominated by discussion of the Edward Snowden revelations regarding the National Security Agency's surveillance activities.Keynote speakers admonished the NSA, attendees debated the topic in the halls of the Moscone Center, and the NSA was the focus of numerous breakout sessions.There might have been even more NSA discussion if not for a grass-roots boycott that resulted from media reports of RSA having created backdoors the NSA could use to crack RSA's encryption technology, which a lot of companies and agencies use.The allegations, first out in a Reuters story in December, led to an unknown number of speakers and attendees opting not to attend the annual conference, one of the biggest in the computer security field.Some critics even organized an alternate one-day event called TrustyCon, slated to be held just down the street from the RSA gathering on Thursday.Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at security software vendor F-Secure, pulled out of his scheduled session at RSA and instead was slated for a TrustyCon speech titled ""The Talk I Was Going to Give at RSA.""Transparency ParamountArthur Coviello, RSA's executive chairman, stayed clear of the topic in his opening keynote on Tuesday. The closest he came to mentioning the NSA was a vague, yet telling, comment: ""Openness and transparence are paramount.""That's not to say RSA, a unit of data storage giant EMC (EMC), hasn't addressed the allegations.In a blog post two days after the first story, the company denied the reports, which also asserted that the RSA had accepted $10 million from the NSA to create the backdoors.""RSA, as a security company, never divulges details of customer engagements, but we also categorically state that we have never entered into any contract or engaged in any project with the intention of weakening RSA's products, or introducing potential backdoors into our products for anyone's use,"" the post read.That denial was made more plausible by RSA's willingness to let the NSA be such a frequent topic at its signature event. It scheduled a lunchtime exploration of the topic by two Washington insiders — Richard Clarke, the former national cyberczar, and Michael Hayden, former CIA director and a principal at the Chertoff Group, an intelligence consulting firm.Clarke, now CEO of cybersecurity advisory firm Good Harbor Security Risk Management, suggested that because of advances in technology, safeguards are needed to prevent a future U.S. president from ramping up surveillance efforts to dangerous levels in the event of another 9/11 massacre.""Once you have a police surveillance state in place, you can't go back,"" Clarke said during the session, held Tuesday.RSA also didn't interfere with the message of Nawaf Bitar, a senior vice president at Juniper Networks (JNPR), who delivered a keynote speech.Bitar used his slot to express anger regarding the NSA's actions and the public's apathy, even taking a shot at those who boycotted the conference.""Not showing up to a conference is not (showing) outrage,"" Bitar said, adding that Americans would express true outrage only if the NSA's actions affected their families or finances. ""If the Snowden revelations would have resulted in our tax rates going up to 90%, there would've been rioting in the streets.""Such outrage would be misplaced, suggested Hayden during the lunchtime session with Clarke.Hayden, a retired Air Force four-star general, said Americans need to understand that NSA surveillance is necessary to ensure national security in a world with new enemies and new technologies.""This is an R-rated movie,"" Hayden said. ""It's for adult nations.""

560,JNPR,"F5 Networks is hiring. That's a good sign for a company whose growth slowed markedly in 2013.
"
561,JNPR,"The company added 115 new employees in fiscal Q2 and expects to hire another 100-plus this quarter. Many are salespeople.
"
562,JNPR,"""We're hiring because we are seeing demand overall as an opportunity,"" John McAdam, the data center gear maker's CEO, said during a fiscal Q2 earnings call on April 23. ""I think you'll see us doing (more hiring) in the future because it would be crazy not to do that.""
"
563,JNPR,"In the quarter ended March 30, Seattle-based F5 Networks (FFIV) posted its best quarterly revenue growth in two years as sales rose nearly 20% to $420 million.
"
564,JNPR,"F5's core business involves Web traffic management. It sells application delivery controllers (ADCs) that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping to speed up websites and communications networks.
"
565,JNPR,"""After a weak 2013, the application delivery market appears to be staging a comeback,"" Citigroup analyst Ehud Gelblum said in a report.
"
566,JNPR,"The ADC market was flat in 2013 at almost $1.6 billion, though F5's sales rose 8%, says Citigroup. It estimates that the ADC market will grow 12% on average from 2014 to 2017. F5 holds more than 40% of the market for hardware-based ADCs, analysts say.
"
567,JNPR,"While F5 is the biggest maker of ADCs, competition has intensified. Citrix Systems (CTXS) and Riverbed Technology (RVBD) have gained market share selling software-based, or ""virtual,"" ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers. In the hardware ADC market, F5 also competes with A10 Networks (ATEN), which went public in March, as well as Radware (RDWR).
"
568,JNPR,"One big rival, Cisco Systems (CSCO), exited the ADC market in late 2012. While Cisco has steered its customers to Citrix, F5 has offered Cisco customers special deals, including trade-in credits, to buy ADCs.
"
569,JNPR,"F5 has also rolled out bigger, more advanced versions of its ADCs. F5's electronic boxes cost from $50,000 to $300,000, depending on how many servers and how much traffic they handle.
"
570,JNPR,"""It took a while, but the product cycle appears to be kicking into gear for F5,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue, who says that replacement of Cisco ADCs boosted F5's fiscal Q2 results.
"
571,JNPR,"Acquisitions and F5's push into security software have also helped revive its revenue growth. F5 bundles security and other software with its data-center hardware.
"
572,JNPR,"""F5 appears to be crossing over into a next-generation platform with software features that extend into security, mobility and software-defined (networking),"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin said in a report.
"
573,JNPR,"F5 has partnered with SDN startup Big Switch Networks.
"
574,JNPR,"In fiscal Q2, F5 reported winning major security deals from a large telecom company and a financial services company.
"
575,JNPR,"Still, some analysts are cautious, given slowing corporate IT spending. F5's federal government sales are a concern. And while F5 has seemed to gain traction in security, it still has tough rivals in Juniper Networks (JNPR), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Cisco, analysts say.
"
576,JNPR,"UBS analyst Amitabh Passi, who has a neutral rating on the stock, forecasts revenue growth as moderate to ""low double digits"" by fiscal Q4. Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey, who also has a neutral rating, expects growth as moderate to ""lower teens"" in 2015 and 2016.
"
577,JNPR,"One worry for IT companies in general and ADC suppliers in particular is that customers such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are building warehouse-sized data centers using their own computing architectures. The Internet companies aim to use low-cost, ""white box"" servers, open-source software and new technologies such as SDN.

578,JNPR,"And Internet cloud-data centers have been designed with ""in-house load balancing solutions"" that direct data traffic to server farms, rather than more costly, branded ADC hardware from F5 and others, Gelblum says.

685,JNPR,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) burst into the enterprise network security forefront in July with an initial public offering, with the stock rising 33% on day one.
"
686,JNPR,"The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is a relative newcomer to the field of network security, taking on longtime leaders such as Check Point Software (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).
"
687,JNPR,"It's disrupted the market by pioneering next-generation firewall technology, says Nir Zuk, chief technology officer and co-founder of Palo Alto Networks.
"
688,JNPR,"Companies need next-generation firewalls because businesses and their employees increasingly use external software applications available through the Internet ""cloud."" This greatly boosts the number of ways cyberattacks gain entry into a business network.
"
689,JNPR,"Zuk spoke with IBD about the company, ahead of the firm's quarterly earnings report slated to released after the close Thursday .
"
690,JNPR,"IBD: What's the big problem businesses face securing their networks today?
"
691,JNPR,"Zuk: In general, your IT (information technology) department knows how to deal with security. They know how to protect you from receiving bad things via email, or accidently sending things you're not supposed to send. They know how to scan incoming traffic for malware, spyware and other viruses.
"
692,JNPR,"But the enterprise today wants to let employees use (cloud) applications like Dropbox (for cloud data storage); or SharePoint (for collaboration in cloud); or WebEx, an online conferencing application that allows for file transfers; or apps like Google (GOOG) Gmail and Docs; or even apps like Salesforce.com (CRM), which allows for file sharing.
"
693,JNPR,"But businesses don't have the same controls and security for these applications as they have for email. They can scan for viruses but they cannot be sure the file you got via Dropbox has a virus in it. Dropbox is one example of (an app that) makes sharing much simpler and enhances the productivity of the user. These are great applications, but the IT department doesn't know how to secure them.
"
694,JNPR,"IBD: And Palo Alto Networks does this with what you call next-generation firewall technology?
"
695,JNPR,"Zuk: Yes. The technology is about taking network security and applying it to all the new applications and making them safe to use. Our customers can safely enable the use of many different applications for their employees.
"
696,JNPR,"The reason our customers switch from an incumbent security provider to Palo Alto Networks is because they are sick of blocking these applications. They see value in using Dropbox and SharePoint and WebEx and instant messaging within an enterprise.
"
697,JNPR,"IBD: Does this require that businesses completely revamp their security system?
"
698,JNPR,"Zuk: Yes and no. Large customers don't wake up one morning and throw away everything they have and replace it with Palo Alto Networks. They do it one step at a time.
"
699,JNPR,"So maybe in the beginning they replace their corporate firewalls, and then they will have a project to replace their data center firewalls, and then their branch office firewalls.
"
700,JNPR,"And sometimes they don't start at the firewall. They may start with an intrusion prevention device or a content filter, and later we become their firewall. But most of the customers, when they start buying our product, set themselves on the path to eventually replace their entire network security infrastructure with Palo Alto Networks.
"
701,JNPR,"IBD: Can other security providers do what Palo Alto Networks does?
"
702,JNPR,"Zuk: Network security today requires a fundamentally different technology and a complete rewrite of the entire product. Incumbents can't afford to do this because of the innovator's dilemma — if they did (rewrite) they'd be cutting the branch they are sitting on, forcing their customers to switch to a new product. That creates a huge revenue gap for them. Since they cannot really go and rebuild their products, they are trying to modify their existing products as close as possible to Palo Alto Networks.
"
703,JNPR,"Our competitors, like Check Point, agree the problem is that all the new applications pose a risk to the enterprise. Their solution is to give you a 'blade' that sits on top of the firewall and blocks these applications. Our solution is we will give you a fundamentally different firewall that secures these applications.
"
704,JNPR,"Until our competitors decide to dump their entire product line and come up with a completely and fundamentally new product line, they will be in the mode of trying to convince the customers that a product that blocks applications is what the customer really needs.
"
705,JNPR,"IBD: What's the reason for all these attacks on networks? Is it corporate espionage, for financial gain or vendettas?
"
706,JNPR,"Zuk: It's all of those. It's corporate and state espionage. More often than not, it's for some kind of financial gain. And the attacks are getting more sophisticated. A lot of money is being pumped into developing these attacks, for financial gain, and more money is coming in.
"
707,JNPR,"Though the reasons for the attacks essentially haven't changed in the last 10 years, the techniques have changed. Money is going into developing new methods of attacks.
"
708,JNPR,"It is difficult to explain the details, but in general the way these attacks happen is by either directly attacking the data center, or more commonly by attacking an end user inside the company and then using their credentials to jump to the data center and steal or change information.
"
709,JNPR,"What's changing is the way those end users are being attacked. In the past, they were attacked via email. Now, a lot of social networking apps are being used to access those users or peer-to-peer apps and Web-based email apps.
"
710,JNPR,"IBD: How did you get into this area?
"
711,JNPR,"Zuk: I was one of the first employees at Check Point. Before that, I spent a few years in the Israeli military, where I dealt with security-related stuff. At Check Point, I built one of the first commercially viable firewalls in the world, which is technology that Palo Alto Networks is replacing. And I started the first intrusion security prevention system company in the world called OneSecure and sold it to NetScreen, which was, at that time, Check Point's biggest competitor. It ended up being acquired by Juniper Networks for $4 billion.
"
712,JNPR,"And then I started Palo Alto Networks. I have been doing this for 20 years. And I have a team that has been following me for many years that is really good at this. It takes time to build expertise in building products like this. I like it. In many areas of networking technology, you follow standards. Here, you follow the bad guys, who are very creative. We have to be very creative as well.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) burst into the enterprise network security forefront in July with an initial public offering, with the stock rising 33% on day one.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is a relative newcomer to the field of network security, taking on longtime leaders such as Check Point Software (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).It's disrupted the market by pioneering next-generation firewall technology, says Nir Zuk, chief technology officer and co-founder of Palo Alto Networks.Companies need next-generation firewalls because businesses and their employees increasingly use external software applications available through the Internet ""cloud.""

A lot of money is being pumped into developing these attacks, for financial gain, and more money is coming in.Though the reasons for the attacks essentially haven't changed in the last 10 years, the techniques have changed. Money is going into developing new methods of attacks.It is difficult to explain the details, but in general the way these attacks happen is by either directly attacking the data center, or more commonly by attacking an end user inside the company and then using their credentials to jump to the data center and steal or change information.What's changing is the way those end users are being attacked. In the past, they were attacked via email. Now, a lot of social networking apps are being used to access those users or peer-to-peer apps and Web-based email apps.IBD: How did you get into this area?Zuk: I was one of the first employees at Check Point. Before that, I spent a few years in the Israeli military, where I dealt with security-related stuff. At Check Point, I built one of the first commercially viable firewalls in the world, which is technology that Palo Alto Networks is replacing. And I started the first intrusion security prevention system company in the world called OneSecure and sold it to NetScreen, which was, at that time, Check Point's biggest competitor. It ended up being acquired by Juniper Networks for $4 billion.And then I started Palo Alto Networks. I have been doing this for 20 years. And I have a team that has been following me for many years that is really good at this. It takes time to build expertise in building products like this. I like it. In many areas of networking technology, you follow standards. Here, you follow the bad guys, who are very creative. We have to be very creative as well.

751,JNPR,"Just before VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger took the stage Monday for his keynote to open the VMworld user conference, a food truck with the phrase ""Take your virtualization to the next level"" on its side drove down the street outside.Gelsinger might as well have been delivering his talk from that truck, as its message clearly meshed with what he was imploring VMware (VMW) customers to do.""You've created the most resilient infrastructure in the history of computing,"" Gelsinger told an audience of thousands at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. ""And we're just getting started.""Not that VMware is alone.The truck was paid for by rival Microsoft (MSFT). In any case, Gelsinger and VMware are doing their best to give customers the technology they need to take their virtualization efforts up a notch.Specifically, VMware is looking to break out of its legacy of providing server virtualization software — a market that's becoming saturated — and extend virtualization to networks and storage resources.Virtualization lets one machine, which typically has been a server, run multiple operating systems, giving it more flexibility and reducing hardware needs.Software-defined networking (SDN) and the software-defined data center, in essence, use software to extend that flexibility in data centers and computer networks.It's a hot trend that networking gear leaders Cisco Systems  (CSCO) and Juniper Networks  (JNPR) are embracing.Along those SDN lines, VMware introduced technology Monday that addresses network and storage virtualization, management of cloud computing resources, and the transition by users to hybrid cloud environments that combine public and private cloud computing resources.The new products, Gelsinger said, will let customers ""build the architecture for tomorrow, but also reduce the costs of the infrastructure you have today.""It's all part of VMware's vision of the software-defined data center, which consists of virtualized applications, network and storage that are automated using software-based management tools.The ability of VMware to deliver on this concept will be key to its future.""A software-defined data center is a bigger problem and bigger market,"" said Peter Christy, an analyst with consulting firm 451 Research. ""The question is whether VMware can maintain its dominant position as this new market develops.""The company took a step toward trying to do just that when it bought network-virtualization vendor Nicira last year.But the nearly $1.3 billion cost of that deal, which led to development of the NSX network-virtualization platform that VMware introduced Monday, has worried investors and analysts.Perhaps bigger issues for observers are whether VMware has exhausted its growth potential in the server virtualization market it pioneered and leads, and recent turnover in the executive ranks. Gelsinger took over for Paul Maritz just before last year's VMworld.Dana Gardner, an analyst for Interarbor Solutions, says concerns have been overblown.""There was this huge opportunity over the past five to seven years to virtualize server workloads,"" Gardner said. ""When you've virtualized all those servers, and you've saved people all that money and allowed them to do things like business continuity and disaster preparedness with greater flexibility, of course your revenue (growth) is going to slow.""VMware can adapt, he says.Investors, though, weren't impressed with Monday's announcements, as VMware shares fell 1.5%.Still, VMware reinforced that it's attacking the software-defined data center.And it says it's already having an impact.Gelsinger brought a panel of big-name customers, such as eBay (EBAY), on stage to share their progress in network virtualization. All cited benefits in the software-defined data center.Sri Shivananda, an eBay executive, said VMware's network virtualization technology has helped the e-commerce giant simplify its infrastructure and gain significant business agility.""Software-defined data centers are a reality,"" he said. is on the line.

768,JNPR,"The prospect of software minimizing the need for hardware has networking leaders Cisco and VMware scrambling to latch onto an emerging technology called software defined networks.
"

"
770,JNPR,"They so far are the biggest companies jockeying in the SDN market, providing a software architecture that helps companies build and configure networks that can deliver more automation, utilization and programmability.
"
771,JNPR,"VMware entered the market last month, saying it would buy SDN vendor Nicira for $1.2 billion. VMware is the No. 1 maker of virtualization software, which lets companies run multiple software programs on one server and which analysts say likely will work in conjunction with SDN.

"
775,JNPR,"But don't expect SDN to reduce a company's spending on computer network gear, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for research firm IDC.
"
776,JNPR,"""Think of SDN as an abstraction layer above the physical infrastructure,"" he said. ""For anyone to say companies will need less network and ports and that Cisco is in trouble is jumping the gun.""
"
777,JNPR,"Yet, the fact that Cisco launched its own SDN effort underscores its potential, says Shaw Wu, an analyst for Sterne Agee.
"
778,JNPR,"""It makes sense to hedge your bets,"" he said.
"
779,JNPR,"Many companies perceive SDN as another step toward adopting virtualization and cloud computing, says Andre Kindness, an analyst for Forrester Research. Cloud computing lets companies store and access their data in data centers with servers that run virtualization software, which send that data to customers via the Internet.
"
780,JNPR,"Virtualization alone isn't able to fully accomplish this goal, Kindness said, ""and that's the reason SDN is so hot.""
"
781,JNPR,"SDN is sort of a glue bringing more cohesion between a company's hardware and software in data center networks, says Mehra. ""SDN will bring to the table a high level of programmability and flexibility,"" he said.

794,JNPR,"""SDN is going to be much bigger than (OpenFlow) but we don't really know what the other pieces are so we can't really size it,"" he said. ""This is more like a three- to five-year story.""The prospect of software minimizing the need for hardware has networking leaders Cisco and VMware scrambling to latch onto an emerging technology called software defined networks.With at least one notable exception, analysts say SDN is no hardware killer. But SDN increasingly looks like a technology that will be widely used to augment computer networks — and that's why Cisco Systems (CSCO) and VMware (VMW) aren't taking any chances.They so far are the biggest companies jockeying in the SDN market, providing a software architecture that helps companies build and configure networks that can deliver more automation, utilization and programmability.VMware entered the market last month, saying it would buy SDN vendor Nicira for $1.2 billion. VMware is the No. 1 maker of virtualization software, which lets companies run multiple software programs on one server and which analysts say likely will work in conjunction with SDN.Cisco's June RolloutCisco, the No. 1 maker of networking gear, rolled out its first SDN offering in June.SDN, a software platform for computer networks, can help companies move and store their data more efficiently, for less cost.But don't expect SDN to reduce a company's spending on computer network gear, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for research firm IDC.""Think of SDN as an abstraction layer above the physical infrastructure,"" he said. ""For anyone to say companies will need less network and ports and that Cisco is in trouble is jumping the gun.""Yet, the fact that Cisco launched its own SDN effort underscores its potential, says Shaw Wu, an analyst for Sterne Agee.""It makes sense to hedge your bets,"" he said.Many companies perceive SDN as another step toward adopting virtualization and cloud computing, says Andre Kindness, an analyst for Forrester Research. Cloud computing lets companies store and access their data in data centers with servers that run virtualization software, which send that data to customers via the Internet.Virtualization alone isn't able to fully accomplish this goal, Kindness said, ""and that's the reason SDN is so hot.""SDN is sort of a glue bringing more cohesion between a company's hardware and software in data center networks, says Mehra. ""SDN will bring to the table a high level of programmability and flexibility,"" he said.But at least one analyst calls SDN much more disruptive.VMware buying Nicira is ""a game-changing moment that will speed customer adoption of SDN architectures,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in a report last month.

802,JNPR,"The $85 billion in government spending cuts from its sequester plan will lower U.S. information technology sales, analysts say, but the full impact is unclear.
"
803,JNPR,"The cutbacks, which began on March 1, recently pushed Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels to cut his forecast on how much money businesses will spend on technology this year in the U.S. by about $10 billion.
"
804,JNPR,"The sequester effects also showed up in the results and outlook issued Wednesday by Oracle (ORCL), which missed Wall Street's sales expectations with its guidance for the current quarter. Oracle's profit and sales for its fiscal Q3 ended Feb. 28 also missed views.
"
805,JNPR,"Then late Thursday, business software maker Tibco Software (TIBX) reported quarterly results that lagged views, as did its outlook.
"
806,JNPR,"""Sequestration will have a negative impact on U.S. tech buying by business and governments, but not a giant one,"" Bartels told IBD.
"
807,JNPR,"He expects U.S. IT spending to rise 6.2% this year, down from his previous estimate of 7.2%. He now expects $829 billion in information technology purchases in the U.S. this year.
"
808,JNPR,"""It's likely federal spending on technology will not grow at all,"" Bartels said.
"
809,JNPR,"The Federal government accounts for 9% of spending on information technology, with state and local governments accounting for a similar percentage, he says. Government cutbacks will likely depress growth in the overall business economy as well, he says.
"
810,JNPR,"The U.S. accounts for 39% of global IT spending. Bartels expects to slightly lower his global IT spending forecast to a 3% increase — to $2.1 trillion — where he had earlier forecast 3.3% growth.
"
811,JNPR,"Software Leads In Spending
"
812,JNPR,"Some 26% of that spending will be for software, 20% for computer equipment and 19.4% on consulting and systems integration.
"
813,JNPR,"Evidence that the sequester cuts are having an impact surfaced in the conference call Oracle held with analysts after posting quarterly results Wednesday. Oracle, a provider of business software and technology, blamed its weak report largely on an expanding salesforce that needed more training. But it saw other factors.
"
814,JNPR,"""It didn't help that the sequester deadline was on the last day of our quarter,"" Safra Catz, Oracle's chief financial officer and co-president, told analysts on a conference call Wednesday. ""That has a little bit of an impact here in North America, but not necessarily anywhere else.""
"
815,JNPR,"But she also said ""our problem was largely sales execution, especially with the new reps.""
"
816,JNPR,"Oracle executives did not say whether business IT spending overall was hot or cold. When an analyst asked if Oracle was slowed by economic weakness or by a flawed business strategy, Co-President Mark Hurd said neither was the case.
"
817,JNPR,"""Anybody can come up with all kinds of factors,"" Hurd said. ""There's always something going on around the world at any given time, and for us we feel good about our ability to execute through it.""

FBR said Cisco and Juniper will be challenged to offset weaker spending on routing and switching gear as they transition to more software and services sales.
"
820,JNPR,"But the problems facing Cisco and Juniper, as with Oracle, do not seem to be slowing IT spending overall. All three companies are facing a tough business transition to cloud computing.

870,JNPR,"EL AL Israel Airlines recently announced that it has launched a fast, reliable commercial in-flight Wi-Fi service, powered by Viasat Inc. , in its aircraft fleet. The high-capacity Ka-band inflight connectivity service will enable non-stop business communication and high speed in-flight connectivity experience for fliers. To date, EL AL has equipped 15 of its aircraft with Viasat's latest equipment, which offers high-speed connectivity to EL AL's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Boeing 737-900 aircraft and Boeing 737-800 planes.Viasat's high-speed Ka-band inflight connectivity service will enable EL AL passengers to stream more internet content and allow flight crews to remain connected for enhanced passenger service. Notably, while flying on TransAtlantic routes, the company’s in-flight Wi-Fi system will connect to the ViaSat-2 satellite that has the highest Ka-band capacity over the Atlantic Ocean. This will provide passengers a high performing in-flight connectivity from across North America and the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Notably, EL AL has decided to offer three internet service packages to passengers — “Basic”, “Social” and “Business”.Existing Business ScenarioViasat has been serving the business aviation industry for a decade. With the surging popularity of high-engagement in-flight connectivity and high passenger engagement, leading airline companies are scouting for new ways to utilize Viasat’s high capacity satellite solutions to maximize passenger satisfaction. The company’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellites providers that run on incumbent business models. Also, as the company has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, it believes that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner.Recently, Viasat extended its partnership with Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) to offer high-speed Ka-band in-flight service to large and mid-cabin business jet passengers. The deal enables fliers to experience business and entertainment even at 40,000 feet above the ground. The company is seeking opportunities to extend broadband satellite mobility to rotary wing aircraft, as it is a large addressable market that can emerge as a key profit churner.In the past three months, Viasat has outperformed the industry, recording a gain of 10.4% compared with 6.1% growth for the latter.Further, of late, the company has been ramping up investments in the development of its revolutionary ViaSat-3 broadband communications platform, which will boast roughly 10 times the bandwidth capacity of ViaSat-2. Solid market traction of ViaSat-1 satellites, coupled with strategically planned ViaSat-2 and ViaSat 3 satellites, are expected to provide Viasat with a solid competitive edge over its peers, thereby bolstering growth in the long run.Key PicksA couple of top-ranked stocks from the same space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

871,JNPR,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) has decided to divest its field service business in Sweden to local communication infrastructure firm, Transtema Group, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, subject to mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals.The to-be-divested unit — Ericsson Local Services AB (“LSS”) — primarily offers field services and maintenance of fixed and mobile networks in Sweden. With an employee base of around 700, the company has created a niche for itself and is reportedly the market leader in the field services operations market in the country.  Ericsson decided to get rid of such a profitable unit to align its businesses with its corporate strategy of operating networks only on behalf of customers and not selling new standalone field services project on its own. Post divesture, LSS will operate as a legal entity of Transtema, with Ericsson as a minority stakeholder.Ericsson is actively pursuing three main areas, namely core business expansion, targeted growth and cost & efficiency to fuel its growth. The company constantly seeks to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployments and prepare grounds for the forthcoming 5G revolution. Ericsson also plans to focus more on software sales and recurring business that complements its thriving Professional Services business in terms of “targeted growth” investments. With such concerted efforts, Ericsson expects to be better-equipped to address the varied needs of its customer segments and capitalize on the market opportunities for faster growth.The company has recorded an average return of 9.4% in the past six months, while the industry declined 0.2%.With a broad proliferation of the Smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased in the recent times. In order to maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson, being one of the premier telecom services providers, is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. Notably, Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide.Therefore, the strategic sale of the field service operations is likely to serve the company in good stead.Ericsson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the industry include Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report), Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report) and SeaChange International, Inc.

872,JNPR,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a sharp rise initially and maintained a flat trajectory thereafter as the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of imported goods against China. The stocks resumed its ascent later in the week but slipped partially yesterday, as Washington issued a fresh threat to impose additional tariffs against the communist nation.At the stroke of midnight last Friday, the United States implemented its long- publicized trade tariffs against China, prompting a swift retaliation of the same magnitude by the latter. As the battle lines were drawn and shots fired from both sides, the U.S. equity markets remained more or less unfazed by the events and seemingly waited for one of the warring nations to blink first to avert any catastrophic damage. However, after Trump issued threats to impose an additional tariff on $200 billion of goods from China, equity markets became shaky and lost resilience.Amid this cacophony, the U.S. Commerce Department offered a window of opportunity for the initiation of trade-related negotiations with China, as it inked an escrow agreement with ZTE to move it closer to resuming its business activities. This would allow China’s second biggest telecommunications equipment manufacturer to start its normal production schedule with access to U.S. suppliers. The seven-year ban imposed on the beleaguered telecom firm in April would be revoked, post its deposit of $400 million in the escrow account.      Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and new investments for network expansion ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) inked an agreement with China Mobile Limited to carry out joint research to explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in 5G networks in China.By collaborating with Nokia, China Mobile seeks to establish a laboratory in Hangzhou, China, to develop a demo system that will evaluate the feasibility of newer applications within 5G ecosystem and leverage AI and machine learning capabilities by working in tandem with third parties.

874,JNPR,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks initially witnessed a V-shaped recovery on game-changing merger news but later witnessed a sharp fall as concerns over fresh restrictions against Chinese companies intensified fears of an escalating trade war in the telecom domain.The Trump administration is reportedly mulling to introduce an executive order that could raise the bar for federal agencies to buy or sell products from Chinese technology firms, citing national security issues. The bone of contention stems from an innate desire between the two warring nations to claim dominance in cutting-edge technologies and the next generation of wireless services. The Pentagon has also banned the sale of smartphones from ZTE and Huawei — two of China’s leading technology brands — from all military establishments.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost.

Product revenues (accounting for 65.7% of total revenues) decreased 14.2% on a year-over-year basis to $710.8 million on lower demand for routing and switching products, partially offset by positive momentum in security products.Services revenues (34.3% of total revenues) were down 5.2% year over year to $371.8 million, largely due to the adoption of new accounting standards (ASC 606).Geographically, revenues increased to $308 million from $284.5 million in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) due to higher number of projects associated with the cloud business and decreased 17.4% and 16.9% in the Americas and Asia Pacific, respectively, to $587.6 million and $187 million.By verticals, revenues from Cloud and Service Provider businesses declined 19.1% and 15.6, respectively, to $268.3 million and $479.9 million due to architectural shifts in the former and seasonality issues and customer transition in the latter. Revenues from the Enterprise vertical were up to $334.4 million from $320.9 million in the year-ago quarter, due to strong financial services and healthy trends across all technologies.MarginsNon-GAAP gross margin was 58.2% for the quarter while non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 12.3% from 20.8% due to lower revenues, customer and product mix and higher service costs, partially offset by improvements in the cost structure.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowTotal cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Mar 31, 2018 were $3,448.4 million compared with $4,043.7 million in the year-ago period.

877,JNPR,"Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 financial results after the closing bell on May 1. The company is unlikely to report higher revenues in either of the operating segments due to volatile demand and stiff market competition.Whether this could result in lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ContractionUnfavorable global macro environment and weak investment patterns among customers are likely to hurt Juniper’s revenue growth. Ongoing consolidation in the telecom market is also expected to weigh on the company’s financials.Moreover, Cloud revenues, which is expected to be $212 million in the to-be-reported quarter, is posing challenges for the company due to spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers as well as architectural transitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Product segment (comprising Routing, Security and Switching products), which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, is currently pegged at $664 million, down from $829 million reported in first-quarter 2017.For the first quarter, net revenues from Routing are expected to decrease to $397 million from $522 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues from Switching might come down to $202 million from $242 million reported in the previous-year quarter.Revenues from the Service segment are expected to be $383 million compared with $392 million in the prior-year quarter. Consequently, total revenues for the quarter are likely to decline to $1,049 million from $1,221 million reported in the year-earlier quarter.Other FactorsDuring the quarter, Juniper expanded its partnership with Affirmed Networks and Netronome to offer mobile providers a simple-to-manage, high-performing distributed mobile cloud solution for rapid deployment of Internet of Things and 5G services.Additionally, Juniper and TIM have initiated a joint agreement to collaborate on the research and development of an innovative cloud-oriented network infrastructure in order to explore the viability of the platform based on automation, virtualization and open interfaces.Juniper also introduced an expanded portfolio of offerings to bring businesses closer to a secure and automated multicloud environment. It aims to provide the infrastructure solutions organizations need to become multicloud-ready by adding to its robust portfolio of data center, campus, branch and cloud networking solutions.The company augmented its unified cybersecurity platform with improved features to thwart data theft and other cyber-crimes. The strategic endeavor is aimed at empowering customers to run their business enterprises with increased confidence at higher efficiency level. Such technological collaborations and new product launches are likely to improve its market position and generate incremental revenues in future.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Juniper is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess one of the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Juniper has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 26 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Juniper Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Juniper Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Juniper has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.81% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Instructure, Inc.

878,JNPR,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks were initially slow off the blocks but gradually picked up pace, as protective measures by the U.S. government seemed to propel the industry to gain an upper hand over its Chinese counterparts.At a meeting held last week, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) came up with a concrete date to auction licenses of high-band spectrum so that wireless networks could roll out 5G technology by the end of the year. The FCC voted unanimously to auction off licenses for the 28GHz spectrum on Nov 14, followed by another round for 24GHz spectrum soon after. The FCC expects to sell about 6,000 individual licenses for different chunks of spectrum in different geographic locations.The FCC also voted unanimously to finalize a plan this year to prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to the U.S. national security. The decision takes a swipe at Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE and intensifies the murky trade war between the two superpowers. The strategic plan aims to thwart the U.S. companies to utilize the $8.5 billion FCC Universal Service Fund to procure goods or services from Chinese firms, limiting the latter’s ability to sell their products in the country.Regarding company-specific news, the earnings season started off with ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) reporting results, while continued product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership gained momentum over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ADTRAN reported lackluster first-quarter 2018 results with both the top line and bottom line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP loss for the reported quarter was 29 cents per share against earnings of 18 cents in the year-earlier quarter and was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents.Total revenues for the first quarter were $120.8 million compared with $170.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $126 million. The significant decline was primarily attributable to slowdown in the spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer (resulting in lower product volumes), high restructuring expenses and a merger-related review. (Read more: ADTRAN Q1 Loss Wider Than Expected on Revenue Decline)2.    In a deadly blow to QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), the U.S. government has banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp.Citing a breach of agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. The strategic move is likely to hit Qualcomm the most, as it accounts for the lion’s share of semiconductor chips used in ZTE smartphones. Consequently, the move could prove to be a boomerang for domestic manufacturers like Qualcomm. (Read more: Qualcomm's Revenues Might be Hit by Ban on Sales to ZTE)3.    In a concerted move to offer superior viewing experiences, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) announced the launch of its MediaFirst End-to-End Ultra High Definition solution.

T-Mobile has agreed to pay a fine of $40 million to the U.S. Treasury to resolve the dispute with the government. (Read more: T-Mobile Fined for False Ring Tones on Rural U.S. Calls)5.    Sprint Corporation (S  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Sprint Smart UC.

(Read more: Sprint Unveils Smart UC to Elevate Employee Collaboration)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major telecom stocks over the past week and during the last six months.In the last five trading days, Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) was the major gainer with its share price rising 3.8% while Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) was the major loser, with its stock declining 1.3%.Over the last six months, Motorola Solutions, Inc.

880,JNPR,"T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has augmented its LTE coverage in New York City area by enabling CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) owned WLNY-TV to repack 600 MHz spectrum per the FCC mandate to clear spectrum for wireless providers. The freed up spectrum will facilitate T-Mobile to better serve its customers in the region with 5G-enabled products and services.Due to the auction of 600 MHz spectrum in April 2017, a significant portion of the TV band spectrum was repurposed to be used by wireless service providers to meet the increased demand of 5G technology. WLNY-TV had time till August 2019 to clear the spectrum for telecom firms on portions of Long Island and the surrounding area that extends into Brooklyn and Queens. However, the broadcaster decided to accelerate the process as it moved to its new spectrum frequency earlier this month.T-Mobile is increasingly deploying 600 MHz LTE across the country and has forged several partnerships with broadcasters to assist them in the move to new airwaves. Its innovative network expansion methodologies continue to be faster and technologically sounder.

By the end of 2017, it had already rolled out 600 MHz spectrum in 586 cities and towns in 28 states across 300,000 square miles. T-Mobile plans to use its 600 MHz spectrum holdings to deploy America’s first nationwide 5G network by 2020.T-Mobile's stellar network performance, deployment of LTE technology and attractive unlimited data offers remain key tailwinds. This is supported by improving scale, healthy free cash flow generation, strong liquidity and valuable spectrum assets that also provide credit support. Backed by impressive subscriber additions, T-Mobile projects postpaid net customer additions between 2.6 million and 3.3 million in 2018.With a diligent execution of operational plans, T-Mobile has gained 0.2% in the past year on an average against a decline of 2.4% for the industry.T-Mobile currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The stock has returned 3.1% against the industry’s 2.7% decline.Moreover, the company’s global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets are commendable. Apart from the company’s strong portfolio of wireless technology solutions, the addition of technologies related to sensors, user interface and video to its offerings is likely to drive considerable value, considering the massive size of the market it licenses.Meanwhile, InterDigital’s is focusing on strategic acquisitions to strengthen its product portfolio. In this regard, the company’s plan to acquire the patent licensing business of Technicolor is expected to provide it with an enhanced portfolio of video technologies besides opening up new opportunities in the consumer electronics market.However, the company’s high investment in R&D projects is likely to affect its profitability in the coming quarters. This apart, the decline in return on capital despite rise in the company’s capital spending and capitalized patent costs remains a concern for the company.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report).

884,JNPR,"Continuing its upbeat performance for the seventh straight quarter, Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported strong results for first-quarter 2018, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company’s expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s revenues, margins and earnings per share, all coming ahead of expectations, were the main highlights of the quarter.Fortinet’s non-GAAP earnings per share of 33 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than management’s guided range of 21-32 cents and marked an improvement over the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 17 cents. This was mainly driven by higher revenues and improved gross profit due to sales mix shift to higher-margin subscription services, which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing (S&M).Quarter in DetailFortinet reported first-quarter revenues of $399 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $390 million. The reported figure also came in 17.1% higher than the year-ago tally. Revenues also came ahead of management’s guided range of $387-$393 million. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter proved conducive to top-line growth.Segment wise, Product revenues increased approximately 6% year over year to $143 million, while Services revenues jumped 25% to $256 million.During the quarter, the company witnessed 21% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth more than $100,000, while the number of deals, worth more than $50,000, climbed 20%.Billings were up 15% on a year-over-year basis to $463.2 million.Non-GAAP gross profit jumped 20.6% from the year-ago quarter to $301.8 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 76.4%. It also came above management’s expectation of 75–76%. The robust gross margin performance was mainly driven by aforementioned shift in sales mix to higher-margin subscription services.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating expenses jumped 11.5% year over year to $234 million. The figure includes a benefit of $11.7 million from adoption of new accounting standards which resulted in lower commission. Excluding the same, operating expenses flared up 17% to $247 million.Management noted that the increase was mainly due to an impact of $7 million from unfavorable currency exchange rates and a 16.8% increase in S&M expenses. Hiring was the main factor that resulted in higher S&M costs. The company revealed that since last September head counts in S&M department has increased 12%.Non-GAAP operating profit surged 65.6% to $70.7 million from approximately $42.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin expanded 520 bps to 17.7%. The figure includes a 390-bps benefit from the aforementioned accounting standard adoption. Excluding the same, operating income improved 130 bps to 13.8%, which came above management’s guided range of 12-13%. Increase in operating margin mainly attributed to higher gross margin.Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.30 billion, down from $1.25 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $313.1 million compared with $348.2 million recorded at the end of fourth-quarter 2017.During the first quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $139.7 million. Free cash flow came in at $128.1 million. Fortinet bought back 2.5 million shares for $115.5 million during the quarter.GuidanceBuoyed by overwhelming first-quarter results, Fortinet raised guidance for full-year 2018.For 2018, management now projects revenues at $1.715-$1.735 billion (mid-point: $1.725 billion), up from the previous range of $1.695-$1.715 billion (mid-point: $1.705 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.71 billion. Billings range has also been raised to $2.040-$2.065 billion from $2.030-$2.050 billion forecasted previously.However, non-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged at 75-76%. Non-GAAP operating margin projections have been raised to 20.2-20.7% from the previous range of 17.7-18%. Non-GAAP operating margin include a 250-bps benefit related to the adoption of new accounting standards.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now estimated between $1.51 and $1.55 (mid-point $1.53), up from earlier forecast of $1.30-$1.32 (mid-point $1.31). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.42 per share. The updated range includes a 19-cent benefit from new accounting rules adoption.The company initiated outlook for the second quarter.The company’s forecasts for the second quarter are impressive. Management expects revenues of $420-$430 million (mid point: $425 million), which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $415.3 million. Billings are estimated in the range of $485-$495 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated in the band of 34-36 cents (mid point: 35 cents). The guidance range is higher than the Consensus Estimate of 33 cents, but represents a year-over-year increase of 27-33%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 75-76%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated between 18.5% and 19%.Our TakeFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company started 2018 on a strong note, reporting solid results for the first quarter, and provided an impressive outlook for the upcoming quarter as well as full year.We believe Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider is paying off as evident from improving margins. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 70-bps gross-margin expansion in 2017 and 220 bps in the first quarter of this year. We anticipated this strategy will continue to improve the company’s bottom-line performances as well.Nonetheless, we are slightly concerned over the company’s slowing revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last seven quarters, the company’s revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet’s second-quarter revenue growth rate guidance range of 15.5-18.3% is also under 20%.In addition to this, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Check Point (CHKP  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

885,JNPR,"The earnings season, which is well past the halfway mark, has proved to be one of the strongest in the past seven years with decent performance across the table. About 267 S&P 500 members have already released their results till Apr 27. Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, first-quarter 2018 is anticipated to register healthy double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter, which was driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to grow 18.5% year over year on 5.5% rise in revenues, which if achieved, would be the highest annual growth rate for the index since 2010.The Technology sector, of which Telecom forms part, appears to be quite strong. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 27.9% year over year while revenues are touted to rise 12.5% due to healthy growth dynamics on the back of existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Let’s take a sneak peek at four major Telecom stocks scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on May 1 to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results after the closing bell. Unfavorable global macro environment and weak investment patterns among customers are likely to hurt Juniper’s revenue growth. Ongoing consolidation in the telecom market is also expected to weigh on the company’s financials. Moreover, the Cloud segment might be hurt due to spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers as well as architectural transitions. It is expected to generate revenues of $212 million.

886,JNPR,"Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) recently announced the expansion of its campus portfolio. The move includes the extension of Ethernet VPN (EVPN)-Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) fabric to enable a common architecture for campus and data center fabrics. The EVPN-VXLAN protocol is ideal for campus architectures as it provides layer-3 transport with layer-2 capabilities.While EVPN is a standards-based technology that provides virtual multipoint bridged connectivity between different Layer 2 domains, VXLAN expands the Layer 2 network address space from four thousand to 16 million, largely solving the scaling issues witnessed in VLAN-based environments.Interestingly, enterprises can build campus networks, using the same protocols that are available today, with Juniper’s new EVPN-VXLAN campus architecture. By extending EVPN-VXLAN beyond data centers, the company is providing building blocks for an enterprise-wide fabric, which is a key component in building a simple and automated multi-cloud.  Juniper’s Branch PortfolioJuniper has enhanced its branch portfolio, with new capabilities in its Contrail SD-WAN solution, using NFX Series, SRX Series and vSRX Series WAN Edge devices combined with Contrail Service Orchestration. Contrail SD-WAN provides a simple and automated multi-cloud SD-WAN, which enables creating an evolvable architecture to simplify growth. It automates the WAN edge across Juniper virtual cloud endpoints and on-premises next-generation firewall. Contrail SD-WAN uses Contrail Service Orchestration to design and run the entire service lifecycle across NFX Series Network Services platforms, MX Series routers and SRX Series services gateways.Resell Agreement With Aerohive NetworksMoreover, at the same time, the company has expanded its alliance with Aerohive Networks, a global Wi-Fi leader, to provide a cloud-managed, wired, wireless and WAN solution. The global resell agreement with Aerohive will enable Juniper to provide a unified cloud managed campus and branch networking solution — from Ethernet switches to enterprise-ready wireless access points.5-Step Multi-Cloud Migration FrameworkJuniper is expanding its 5-step multi-cloud migration framework to include evolution paths for campus and branch networks. The migration provides enterprises with a set of best practices and natural technology insertions for easier completion of the journey to a secure, and automated multi-cloud.Share Price PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of Juniper have outperformed the industry, with average return of 12% compared with 4.4% growth of the industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

887,JNPR,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks took an initial beating before witnessing a sharp rise, as healthy earnings surprises seemed to propel the industry.The industry initially received a jolt when antitrust authorities made it clear that a competitive environment was of utmost importance. The Department of Justice initiated a probe related to the alleged collusion between AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers. The bone of contention refers to the ESIM technology that allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, thereby making their businesses more volatile.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Verizon started 2018 on a positive note with a relatively healthy performance in the first quarter, primarily led by the wireless business. The bottom line also benefited from significant savings from the tax reform.GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $4,666 million or $1.11 per share compared with $3,553 million or 84 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were $1.17 per share compared with 95 cents in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Consolidated GAAP revenues increased 6.6% year over year to $31,772 million on the back of solid performance in the wireless business. Excluding revenues from divested businesses, non-GAAP consolidated revenues were $29.9 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31,157 million. (Read more: Verizon Beats Q1 Earnings on Solid Wireless Business)2.    In first-quarter 2018 results, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) reported a non-IFRS income of SEK 0.11 (1 cent) per share (excluding amortizations, write-downs of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges) against loss of SEK 2.19 in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 3 cents.Net sales for the quarter fell 9% year over year to SEK 43.4 billion ($5.3 billion). The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,547 million. This was mainly due to lower revenues in market areas North East Asia as well as in South East Asia, Oceania and India. (Read more: Ericsson Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Lag)3.    Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported healthy results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 25, 2018), supported by better-than-expected performance in semiconductor business and lower operating expenses.On a GAAP basis, quarterly net income came in at $363 million or 24 cents per share compared with $749 million or 50 cents in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were 80 cents, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. Quarterly total revenues of $5,261 million increased 13% year over year. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,201 million. (Read more: Qualcomm Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates)4.    AT&T reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, with the top and the bottom lines missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate despite solid prepaid phone gains, record low first-quarter postpaid phone churn and continued DIRECTV NOW subscriber growth.On a GAAP basis, AT&T reported net income of $4,662 million or 75 cents per share compared with $3,469 million or 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were 85 cents per share compared with 74 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Consolidated revenues decreased 3.4% year over year to $38,038 million, primarily due to decline in legacy services, adverse impact of the transition of video from linear to over-the-top services and divesture of low-margin businesses. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39,452 million.

888,JNPR,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) recently entered into a strategic partnership with Sudatel — a telecommunications and Internet service provider, based in Sudan. Per the deal, both the companies will work on the development of ultra-broadband services in Sudan.Notably, the partnership will support Sudatel’s 2020 Strategy, under which Sudatel aims to transform itself from a traditional telecom operator to an ICT provider. The collaboration will enable both the companies to trial Nokia 4.5G Pro, 4.9G and 5G mobile technologies along with Nokia’s fixed fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) portfolio. As a result, mobile and residential broadband experience across the country is expected to improve significantly.Under the collaboration, Nokia and Sudatel will perform a number of different use-case tests, leveraging Nokia fixed and mobile technologies in Nokia Laboratories, located in Espoo and Antwerp. The technologies to be used in the trial are likely to be implemented in Khartoum. This, in turn, is expected to enhance network capacity and speed through the AirScale radio access. Additionally, this partnership will allow Sudatel to trial Nokia's passive optical networking (PON) fiber solutions for improving the residential broadband experience.Our TakeNokia has successfully become a leading player in the mobile and fixed network infrastructure with the industry’s most complete, end-to-end portfolio of products, services and licensing. Currently, the company is driving the transition of global enterprises into smart virtual networks by creating a single network for all services, converging mobile and fixed broadband, IP routing and optical networks with the software and services to manage them.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has returned 16.4% against the industry’s 2.7% decline.Moreover, the company is expected to benefit from the rollouts of next-generation 5G networks, which is likely to improve the market conditions significantly in 2019 and 2020. Also, Nokia’s Networks division is anticipated to grow faster than the primary addressable market over the long term.However, Nokia has considerable operations in geographies outside the United States. Its significant international presence exposes it to political and economic disruptions, all of which might directly impact the company’s profits.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

(JNPR  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 53 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.However, earnings decreased 22% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 11% year over year to $1.24 billion.

This factor is expected to hurt top-line growth in the ongoing quarter as well.Juniper stated that the transition by cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary cause behind lower revenues. Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud product innovations and customer base continue to expand in the quarter. Of the top 10 customers, four were cloud customers while five were Telecom/Cable customers.Telecom/Cable revenues increased after two consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline.

891,JNPR,"Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) has extended its existing collaboration with Red Hat, Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report), world's leading provider of open source solutions, to provide a unified solution for enterprises to ease their process of adopting cloud-native platforms. This initiative will involve tighter integration of Red Hat OpenShift Container platform and Red Hat OpenStack Platform with Juniper Contrail Enterprise Multicloud.Move to Bridge an Important Industry GapIT organizations across the world are constantly under pressure to improve efficiency, agility and scalability of their services while simultaneously maintaining security and compliance. This creates the need for technologies like OpenStack for building a private cloud with which IT teams can keep the development of essential applications behind the firewall. Modern and innovative solutions, which help customers meet current and future requirements, can be held back by existing vendor lock-in that pushes customers into a rigid and expensive environment. These issues created a gap which gave Juniper Networks and Red Hat an excellent opportunity to design a solution aiming to mitigate the challenges. This solution can simultaneously manage IT teams’ connectivity, security and visibility, making it easier for enterprises to manage their hybrid or multicloud environments and avoid any vendor lock-in, thus expediting innovation.OpenStack, OpenShift and Contrail Cloud:  Why a Tighter Integration is ImportantJuniper believes that for the entire IT ecosystem to efficiently manage workload and run efficiently, network and security policy should remain out of the way of any cloud-based workload placement decision. Aiming to make this possible, last month, the company rolled out Contrail Enterprise Multi-Cloud, designed to simplify and accelerate safer deployment and operations of distributed and scalable clouds. As more and more customers are seeking to move away from the lock-in in systems like VMware’s NSX and Cisco’s ACI, the integration of Red Hat’s OpenStack and OpenShift Container platform into Juniper’s Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud provides a more flexible, open-source based, multicloud alternative to the existing proprietary technologies.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Juniper has outperformed the industry on an average, yielding 4.2% return against a decline of 1.3% for the latter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

892,JNPR,"Investors looking for stocks in the Wireless Equipment sector might want to consider either Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) or InterDigital (IDCC  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Juniper Networks and InterDigital are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than IDCC has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.35, while IDCC has a forward P/E of 91.11. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 2.68. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IDCC currently has a PEG ratio of 6.07.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.21. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, IDCC has a P/B of 2.75.Based on these metrics and many more, JNPR holds a Value grade of B, while IDCC has a Value grade of F.JNPR sticks out from IDCC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JNPR is the better option right now.

893,JNPR,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 20. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this memory chip maker will be able to continue its impressive performance in the quarter.Notably, Micron has delivered positive earnings surprises for 10 straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 8%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.As long as memory chip prices and demand continue to rise, Micron is likely to keep benefiting. The ongoing investigation by the Chinese government on allegations that Micron, along with Samsung and SK Hynix, indulged in fixing memory prices, is unlikely to conclude any time soon. This lowers the possibility of any negative impact on demand and prices in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Micron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Micron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 but has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the stock is likely to register massive year-over-year growth on both the counts, i.e. revenues and earnings per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter’s earnings is pegged at $3.14, which is 93.8% higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.62. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.70 billion, up 38.3% from the prior-year quarter tally.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.DRAMs to Continue Driving RevenuesMicron has been the key beneficiary of the upswing in DRAM prices and strong demand which was triggered in the second half of calendar-year 2016. DRAM, which is one of Micron’s biggest revenue contributing segment (71% of 2Q18 revenues), is likely to deliver better numbers, given a supply shortage and increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at datacenters. This should further drive demand for DRAMs. Notably, AI-enabled servers require five to six times the capacity of regular DRAMs compared to standard cloud servers.Going ahead, rising demand for DRAMs from autonomous vehicle manufacturers is expected to have aided the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results. Self-driving vehicles need to make real-time decisions by analyzing large amounts of data, which necessitates the use of high-performance DRAMs.Declining NAND Prices to Partially Mute Top-Line GrowthIn the last fiscal, the company witnessed impressive growth in NAND revenues due to the massive demand-supply gap which escalated chip prices. Nonetheless, we expect this segment’s growth rate to have remained moderate in the fiscal third quarter as the supply-demand gap has narrowed down significantly, according to various research firms, which is affecting chip prices adversely.Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, Micron witnessed a low-double-digit rise in bit shipments, while average selling price (ASP) declined in the mid-teens range. Therefore, looking at the current scenario, we believe decline in ASP will have negatively impacted the company’s NAND revenues and margins, and somewhat offset the benefits from improved demand and prices for DRAM products.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.77% and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1.Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.54% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and holds a Zacks Rank of 3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

895,JNPR,"Shares of Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report) have returned 84% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 8.7% rally of the industry. This outperformance can be attributed to company’s robust product portfolio as well as frequent customer wins.However, Arista was recently downgraded by Cleveland Research citing concerns that companies operating large scale data centers might “shift” to other white-box switch providers or design its own.Shares plunged 9.2% to close at $244.20, on Apr 13, following the report.Customer Concentration: Significant HeadwindCustomer concentration related to Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is a significant concern for Arista. The software giant accounted for 16% of the company’s total revenues in 2017. Per CNBC, Arista expects Microsoft to attribute for 10% of revenues in 2018.Moreover, intensifying competition in the routing space from Juniper (JNPR  -  Free Report) remains a headwind. Further, subdued guidance for first quarter of fiscal 2018 along with costs associated with the ongoing lawsuit with Cisco over patents remain headwinds for the company.Nevertheless, we believe robust portfolio and customer wins will help the stock rebound in the near term.Solid Growth OpportunitiesArista’s switches and routers support the high-end cloud networking market that require fast throughput at low cost. The company recently launched time saving and cost efficient 7050X3 and 7260X3 platforms to enhance routing & switching for futuristic data centers.We believe Arista is well poised to benefit from strong demand for its data center switches and routers.

Terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Particularly, Palo Alto’s chairman and CEO, Mark McLaughlin, was optimistic about the “endpoint detection and response, or EDR, capabilities” that are expected to enhance the company’s solutions portfolio, once the integration is completed.Also, Secdo’s unique “thread-level approach” of collecting and visualizing data provides better clarity, which optimizes the efficiency level of responding against cyber attacks.

898,JNPR,"Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results on Jan 30. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.79%. However, we note that Juniper has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.51%.Juniper reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 55 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, earnings decreased 5.2% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 2.1% to $1.26 billion. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 billion.The disappointing top-line growth can be attributed to weak performance in both Cloud and Telecom/Cable verticals. Cloud revenues declined 4% from the year-ago quarter and more than 9% sequentially to almost $345 million. Management cited spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers to be the reason behind the decline. This factor is anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The stock has gained just 8.1% year over year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 23.9%.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 52 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 21.2%.

Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud customer base continues to expand. Of the top 10 customers, five were cloud while four were Telecom/Cable. Juniper has witnessed accelerated demand and adoption of its Software Defined Secure networks (SDSN) platforms.Juniper completed the acquisition of Cyphort, a leader in automated malware analysis and detection. This is expected to drive the top line in the near term.Security revenues plunged 16.6% but increased 3.8% sequentially to $71.3 million. The growth can primarily be attributed to momentum in the data center, service provider and next-gen firewall sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Security revenues is currently pegged at $71 million.Contrail Security continued to grow in the quarter and won several new customers. The company unveiled Contrail Security, which ensures protection for applications that are deployed in volume-loaded heterogeneous cloud-based environments is a key catalyst. Moreover, AppFormix’s customer base continues to expand across SaaS, enterprises and telecom operators.Nonetheless, Juniper is facing significant pricing pressure amid intensifying competition in the network equipment market from the likes of Arista Networks Inc, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO  -  Free Report) and others including white-box vendors.The company’s routing business has been affected by this competition.

899,JNPR,"In a concerted move to thwart data theft and other cyber crimes, Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) augmented its unified cybersecurity platform with improved features. The strategic endeavor is likely to empower customers to run their business enterprises across the globe with increased confidence at higher efficiency levels.The unified cybersecurity solutions interoperate with existing devices in order to simplify security operations and mitigate operating risks. This typically leads to improved productivity and fortifies the businesses with stronger security posture across enterprise networks and public clouds.Powered by the Software-Defined Secure Network, the unified cybersecurity platform offers adaptive detection, automated enforcement and one-touch mitigation. This helps to radically transform the business network into a cyber-defense system to proactively manage threats and detect hard-to-catch malware with threat behavior analysis.Juniper Networks, a leading provider of networking solutions and communication devices, has also integrated its SRX Series Next-Generation Firewalls with the Advanced Threat Prevention Appliance for a consolidated timeline view of all threats in the network. This will enable a faster and proactive defense against known and unknown threats. The company has further extended its data centers for Juniper Sky ATP in Asia Pacific and Canada, in addition to its existing data centers in the United States and Europe. This is likely to facilitate compliance with regional data regulations with increased reliability on lower latency.  At the same time, the company has joined the Cyber Threat Alliance, an organization dedicated to improving the security of the global digital ecosystems through cyber threat information sharing. This will likely help Juniper Networks to reinforce its commitment to an open and unified approach to cybersecurity for a safer global business environment.Despite having a strong security portfolio (SRX Platform & Security Software, Screen OS and other Legacy products), the company has not been doing well for the past few quarters due to lower-than-expected demand for non-Junos-based security products. Juniper Networks’ networking architecture runs on a single open source operating software named Junos. On the other hand, the poor performance by the Junos business prompted the company to sell off the mobile security unit. Going forward, the security business may remain a drag on results because of the loss of $30 million quarterly contribution by the mobile security platform.The company has underperformed the industry in the last three months with an average loss of 16.3% compared with a decline of 6.9% for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the improved cybersecurity platform can help revive the fortunes of the company.Juniper Networks is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Clearfield, Inc. (CLFD  -  Free Report), Ceragon Networks Ltd. (CRNT  -  Free Report) and Orange S.A.

901,JNPR,"Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) recently announced that Fujitsu Limited  has deployed its cloud management platform — AppFormix, in Japan.The move forms a key part in ensuring operational efficiency of the new region of Fujitsu’s enterprise cloud platform, Cloud Service K5, the world’s largest open-source based platform.AppFormix provides end-to-end visibility into multicloud environment to eliminate any potential issues and thereby makes operations simpler and more effective. It provides comprehensive visualization and smart-monitoring features to detect issues and automatically manage remedial actions based on predefined business outcomes. It transforms raw data from a diverse set of resources into a format that can be used immediately, through monitoring and intent-based analytics.Since Fujitsu prepared for the launch of the new region of K5, it required a cloud operations management solution that could address the operational requirements as well as bring significantly increased capabilities. This is where Juniper came into play and was selected to develop and deploy AppFormix for Fujitsu’s K5 platform.AppFormix is a crucial component of the K5 platform especially for the understanding of real-time cloud usage status through its intelligent dashboards and seamless integration with billing systems. The platform addresses the growing operational needs, offering simplified cloud operations management and performance optimization capabilities through Big Data analysis and machine learning.Furthermore, AppFormix’s unique user-friendly GUI dashboard, displaying real-time reporting and high-level compatibility with OpenStack, has allowed Fujitsu to better plan resource consumption and capacity expansion.Leveraging the operating system, Juniper has introduced several products and enhancements over the past few years.

902,JNPR,"With the March-quarter earnings drawing to a close, industry peers are doing various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry — Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetJuniper reported relatively healthy first-quarter 2018 results on the back of a solid performance from the cloud vertical and growth in enterprise business. Despite year-over-year decrease in earnings and revenues, the company was able to beat the respective estimates and remains confident of returning to a growth trajectory by the end of the year. Non-GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $99.5 million or 28 cents per share compared with $178 million or 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter owing to top-line woes. Non-GAAP earnings, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Net revenues for the quarter were $1,082.6 million compared with $1,221 million in the prior-year period. Also, the tally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,049 million.Harris reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $1.67 per share compared with $1.38 in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Revenues for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $1,568 million, supported by growth across all three segments led by Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,548 million.Based on recently-released earnings results, Juniper has a clear edge over Harris due to a better earnings and sales surprise percentage.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Harris has clearly outperformed Juniper with an average return of 41.7% against a loss of 9.6% for the latter while the industry gained 7.2%.  Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Juniper’s current-quarter estimates increased from 42 cents to 43 cents per share (up 2.4%) while that for the current year increased from $1.78 to $1.79 (up 0.6%).Harris’ current-quarter estimates decreased to $1.76 from $1.78 post earnings release (down 1.1%) while current-year estimates increased to $6.48 per share from $6.44 (up 0.6%). With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Juniper than Harris with respect to current-quarter estimates but fairly balanced for current-year estimates.GuidanceJuniper anticipates recording sequential growth in the second quarter with margin improvement, driven by steady demand patterns, higher volumes and cost structure efficiencies. The company expects revenues of approximately $1,175 million (+/- $30 million) for second-quarter 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 59% (+/- 1%). The company expects non-GAAP operating margin of 17.5%. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 44 cents per share (+/- 3 cents).Harris tweaked its projection for fiscal 2018 owing to impressive performance in the fiscal third quarter. It expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the band of $6.45-$6.50, up from prior expectations of $6.30-$6.50. Fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to be approximately $6.14 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4% from the earlier expectations of $6.08-6.14 billion. The company also anticipates adjusted free cash flow between $900 million to $925 million, up from the previous guidance of approximately $900 million.Zacks RankBoth Juniper and Harris currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although the two stocks seem to match each other on most counts, Juniper appears to have trumped Harris on few metrics and stands out as a better investment proposition. A couple of top-ranked stocks in the industry are Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Motorola has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8%. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 12.1%.Ubiquiti Networks has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 18.6%.

903,JNPR,"Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs. This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes, pushing yields higher. According to CME, there is 51% chance of four interest rates hike this year.The 10-year Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, jumped to a 7-year high of 3.12%. The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price, which is back to $80 per barrel level, and upbeat April retail sales. Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields (read: ETF Strategies to Play the 7-Year High Benchmark Yield).Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology, industrials and consumer discretionary. Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs).Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country, boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies, it would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit, given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates.Further, higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Given this, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates and the ones that will be badly impacted.Sectors to WinFinancialsThe ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report), with AUM of $32.9 billion and average daily volume of 61.6 million shares, offers broad exposure to the sector with banks making up for 44.9% of the portfolio.

904,JNPR,"Continuing with its upbeat performance for the sixth straight quarter, Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company’s expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fortinet’s non-GAAP earnings per share of 32 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than management’s guidance range of 28-30 cents and marked an improvement over the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 30 cents, driven mainly by higher revenues which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses.Quarter in DetailFortinet reported fourth-quarter revenues of $416.7 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $409 million and up 14.8% year over year. Segment wise, Product revenues increased 2% year over year to $162.1 million, while Services revenues jumped 24.8% to $254.6 million. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter also proved conducive to top-line growth.During the fourth quarter, the company witnessed 21% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth more than $100,000, while the number of deals worth more than $250,000 and $500,000 climbed 31% and 24%, respectively.Billings were up 15% on a year-over-year basis to $534 million.Non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) gross profit jumped 14.4% from the year-ago quarter to $313.9 million. However, gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 75.3%. It also came in below the mid-point of management’s expectation of 75-76% (mid-point 75.5%).Furthermore, non-GAAP operating expenses jumped 21.6% year over year to $235.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses advanced 320 bps year over year to 56.5%.Non-GAAP operating profit declined 3% to $78.7 million from approximately $81.1 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin contracted 350 bps to 18.9%, mainly due to lower gross margin and escalating operating expenses as a percentage of revenues which more than offset the benefit of higher revenues. Operating margin, however, came at the higher-end of the company’s guidance range of 18-19%.Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.25 billion, down from $1.28 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter. Accounts receivable were $346.2 million compared with $258 million witnessed at the end of the previous quarter.During the year, the company generated operating cash flow of $594.4 million. Free cash flow for 2017 came in at $459.1 million. Fortinet bought back 11.2 million shares for $446.3 million during the year.GuidanceFortinet initiated outlook for first-quarter and full-year 2018.The company’s forecasts for the first quarter are slightly lackluster. Management expects revenues in the range of $387-$393 million (mid point: $390 million), which is marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $390.7 million at mid-point. Billings are estimated in the range of $449-$457 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 21-22 cents (mid point: 21.5 cents). The guidance range is much lower than the Consensus Estimate, but represents a year-over-year increase of 26.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated in the range of 75-76%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be between 12% and 13%.For 2018, management projects revenues in the range of $1.695-$1.715 billion (mid-point: $1.705 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.70 billion. Billings are forecast in the band of $2.030-$2.050 billion.Nevertheless, the company anticipates that its cost-management initiatives will drive margins and earnings per share. Non-GAAP gross and operating margin projections are in the range of 75-76% and 17.7-18%, respectively.Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to lie between $1.30 and $1.32 (mid-point $1.31). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19.Our TakeFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Nonetheless, lackluster first-quarter 2018 outlook makes us slightly cautious about its near-term performance.Moreover, we are concerned over the company’s sluggish revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last six quarters, the company’s revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than the previous rates of more than 30%. Additionally, Fortinet’s first-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 13.8-15.6%.In addition to this, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Check Point (CHKP  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Palo Alto Networks, remains another concern.Nonetheless, we believe Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to a subscription-based service provider will drive the company’s bottom-line results over the long run. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 70-bps gross-margin expansion in 2017. We anticipate this strategy will continue to improve the company’s bottom-line performance in the near future as well.Fortinet has outperformed the industry to which it belongs over the past year. The stock has gained 15.9%, while its industry registered growth of 6.5% during the same time frame.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

905,JNPR,"Shares of Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report) rallied to a 52-week high of $46.63, eventually closing a tad lower at $46.01 on Jan 19.We believe that this provider of network security appliances is gaining from product ramp ups, deal wins and continuous growth of the network security market.Fortinet stock has gained 42.9% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 14.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Influencing Factors in DetailFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration.Cyber security is becoming an essential requirement for the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments. Fortinet’s experience in the security space and continued delivery of mission-critical solutions helped it gain substantial market share in this segment.Most recently, at Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, the company announced its security and threat protection abilities related to connected cars. Fortinet in association with Renesas Electronics has developed this technology that will be beneficial for preventing attacks on connected vehicle networks.We believe that with the company’s sustained focus on enhancing its Unified Threat Management (UTM) portfolio through product development and acquisitions, the company is expected to retain its position in this sector, one of the fastest growing segments in network security, per industry analysis.Per a recent report by Gartner, spending on enterprise security is expected to increase 8% year over year in 2018 to reach $96 billion. With all these initiatives, Fortinet is expected to make the most of the opportunity.Additionally, Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider is positively impacting its margins and bottom line.However, this transformation, which is affecting the near-term results of the company and stiff competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc.

907,JNPR,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially and traded flat thereafter only to decline further as concerns related to the U.S-China trade war resumed in a dramatic turn of events.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration reached a settlement on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This included a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers at the company. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on the Chinese firm related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Just when it appeared that things were working toward reducing the United States’ negative balance of trade against China, President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Some industry observers believe that the tactic is part of Trump’s broader plan to gain leverage in the trade talks as Commerce department secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China later this week. However, the volte-face could derail the trade negotiations as China vouched to counter the move with similar restrictions.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

911,JNPR,"Benchmarks finished mixed on Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks to financial stocks. Investors moved to financial stocks after both Yellen and Powell gave enough hint of a rate hike next month. Meanwhile, the second estimate of the U.S. GDP showed that the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years, which further boosted investors’ sentiment.  While the Dow posted an all-time record finish, the Nasdaq took a beating due to decline in tech stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.4%, to close at 23,940.68. The S&P 500 Index (INX) lost 0.04% to close at 2,626.07. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,824.39, decreasing 1.3%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,467 to 1,340. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,478 to 1,270. The CBOE VIX increased 2.8% to close at 10.31.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Nasdaq tanked almost 88 points to end in the negative territory. The tech-laden index posted its worst single-day drop since Aug 17. Such losses were triggered after the investors rotated out of the tech stocks to financial stocks. Yellen’s comments that a burgeoning U.S. economy would pave way for the future of rate hikes encouraged the investors to move to financial stocks.Moreover, Powell had commented on Tuesday that he would continue to work toward raising interest rates at the same time as gradually unwinding the Fed’s humungous balance sheet. This also bolstered gains for the financial stocks.Shares of major tech players such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all declined 4%, 2.7%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively. The PHLX Semiconductor index tanked 4.4% to 1,265.01 to post its biggest decline since Dec 1, 2016. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 shed less than a point to also end in the red. Although, eight of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500 ended in the green, gains were negated by sharp losses for the tech stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined 2.2%. Such losses for the tech stocks weighed heavily on the broader markets.Finally, the Dow amassed 103 points to close at a record high following better-than-expected GDP data in the third quarter. Such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index was also supported by gains for UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), shares of which increased 3.1% and 2.3%.U.S. GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014. Per the report from the Commerce Department, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year-over-year.However, some analysts stated that such figures are rather aggrandized and do not present a true picture of the health of the economy. They have reasoned that inventories accounted for as much as 25% of the GDP growth and if excluded from the calculation, the U.S. GDP stands at 2.5% annual rate of growth.In her final testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Janet Yellen commented that the economic growth is largely broad based “across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” However, price data in the GDP report clearly indicated that inflation remained well below the targeted 2%.Economic DataThe Fed’s Beige Book report showed that the economy has expanded at a modest to moderate pace. Moreover, the Fed also reported that it noticed a ‘slight improvement in the outlook.’Further, pending home sales for the month of October increased 3.5%, surpassing the consensus estimate of a 2% growth.

914,JNPR,"Today’s tech sector is not known for providing numerous opportunities for value investors, as traditional valuation metrics have been replaced with anticipation for the future. Of course, there are still plenty of undervalued tech stocks—as long as you know the right places to look.For one, value investors will want to stick to stocks with strong Zacks Ranks. The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions, so it is independent of many classic valuation figures, but our proven system has more than doubled the S&P 500 since 1988.But investors looking for specific trends, like value stocks, can pair the Zacks Rank with our Style Scores system. Our Style Scores are complementary indicators designed to find stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.Of these indicators, one of our most popular categories has proven to be the “Value” category. Value investors love this category because it seeks to identify undervalued stocks by comparing key metrics like P/E ratio, P/S ratio, and Cash Flow/Share to the industry and market averages.With that said, we’ve found five tech stocks that all sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an “A” grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. Value investors, check these out:1.       Alps Electric (APELY  -  Free Report)Alps Electric is a Japan-based company mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale of electronic components and audio equipment. The company is currently sporting a P/E ratio of 12.34, which bests its “Computer - Peripheral Equipment” average of 21.91. Alps Electric does have a PEG ratio of 1.47, which is not traditionally great—but it still comes in better than the industry average of 3.20. On top of this, the company is currently generating about $6.25 in cash per share, which is a sign that its financial health is on the uptick. 2.       Changyou.com (CYOU  -  Free Report)Changyou.com is a developer and operator of online games in China, and it has been a big beneficiary of the recent Chinese internet boom. Additionally, the stock has a P/E ratio of just 10.58 and a PEG ratio of 0.52, which are both better than the respective “Internet – Content” averages of 31.15 and 1.34. Also, the company’s P/B ratio of 1.62 and P/CF ratio of 12.27 provide further proof that the stock is trading at a discount to the market. Changyou is also sporting a better-than-industry EV/EBITDA ratio. 3.       Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report)Juniper Networks is a provider of Internet infrastructure solutions, including routers, switches, network management software, and network security products. The stock is currently sporting an impressive P/E ratio of just 12.41. Furthermore, its PEG ratio of 1.21 is better than the “Wireless Equipment” industry average of 1.34. Juniper’s P/S ratio of 2.04 is just slightly above “undervalued” territory, but with sales expected to grow both this year and next year, that could improve soon. Finally, Juniper has a P/B ratio of 2.08, which is well below the S&P 500 average of 3 and further underscores why this is one of the more undervalued tech stocks on the market right now. 4.       Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report)Micron Technology is a semiconductor manufacturing company that has emerged has one of the hottest stocks in this booming industry. But even with shares gaining over 60% year-to-date, the company’s P/E ratio is still a miniscule 5.80 and its PEG ratio is currently sitting at 0.58. Furthermore, while its P/S ratio of 2.25 isn’t necessarily excellent, it shows that the company does have a strong revenue stream. On top of this, the stock’s P/B ratio of 2.30 and P/CF ratio of 11.77 are both firmly in a range that would be considered undervalued. 5.       Fujifilm Holdings (FUJIY  -  Free Report)Fujifilm is one of the world’s most recognizable brands in the camera, film, and imaging equipment business.

915,JNPR,"Telecom service provider, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) inked a content distribution services agreement with Net Insight for integrating the latter’s Sye solution with its Unified Delivery Network (“UDN”). Ericsson’s UDN offering is a content distribution service that assists low-latency, live content delivery.Ericsson’s UDN aids in partnership between content and service providers to create turnkey, value-added services by using infrastructure inside service provider networks, distributing content closer to end users resulting in advanced viewing experience. Net Insight’s Sye solution harmonizes the viewing experience throughout live streaming events, enabling everyone to see the same content at the same time.The co-developed solution will be able to improve efficiency of the global content distribution service. The collaboration will also result in resolving the latency and synching issues, allowing content and service providers to create an immersive live streaming experience.Ericsson’s UDN has already been deployed by a large number of content providers across the globe to improve network capabilities in the public domain, allowing services to be optimized and monetized in new ways. In July, Japan-based mobile phone operator, NTT DOCOMO, INC. selected Ericsson to deliver its UDN solution, which would enable DOCOMO users to access a diverse range of high-quality content.Being one of the premier telecom services providers, Ericsson is in high demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. Notably, Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. Ericsson is poised to benefit significantly as operators continue to invest in telecom core networks for the deployment of new service offerings such as Voice over LTE among others.Moreover, the company is also investing in R&D to increase competitiveness in Networks business. As a matter of fact, Ericsson is enthusiastic about the turnaround of the Chinese market in terms of 4G deployment and believes this will be a significant growth driver, going forward.However, the company’s stock has yielded a negative return of 12.9% over last six months, underperforming the industry’s average return of 2%.

Ericsson’s repeated earnings misses, eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline have left investors high and dry.

916,JNPR,"The rumors that Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) was looking to buy Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) for around $16 billion were making rounds late yesterday.  In fact, the Juniper stock surged in double-digits in after-hours trading, following media reports that Nokia was in talks with Juniper pertaining to its takeover.The speculations regarding the buyout were, however, put to rest when Nokia issued a statement to the contrary.  In its press release the company declared that ""Nokia is not currently in talks with, nor is it preparing an offer for, Juniper Networks related to an acquisition of that company."" Following Nokia’s denial, shares of the network-equipment maker lost a lion’s share of its after-market gains.In fact, rumors pertaining to Nokia taking over Sunnyvale, California-based Juniper to bolster its networks unit are not new. Speculations on this issue had surfaced in 2014 as well. Though the companies did not merge at that time, they inked a deal to expand their alliance for advancing telco cloud.Though Nokia, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has denied its interest in Juniper, the former has been quite active on the acquisition front. In April 2015, the Finland-based company had acquired Alcatel-Lucent for approximately $16.6 billion. From the buyout, Nokia expects to realize annual operating cost synergies €1.2 billion in 2018.

Following the deal, the company got an up-front payment in cash from Apple, which boosted Nokia’s balance sheet. Earlier in November, Nokia signed an agreement with China Unicom (CHU  -  Free Report) to deploy small cells in China.We are, however, concerned about Nokia’s primary division’s – the Networks unit — below-par performance. What is worse is that the company does not expect this segment to show any recovery in the near future. Currently, it expects the primary addressable market for the Networks unit to decline in the band of 4% to 5% compared with 3% to 5%, projected earlier. In 2018, the market is expected to decline in the band of 2% to 5% as well.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

919,JNPR,"On Nov 15, Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Why the Downgrade?The downgrade can primarily be attributed to the unimpressive third-quarter 2017 results of the company.In the last quarter, Juniper reported non-GAAP earnings of 55 cents per share that decreased 5.2% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 2.1% to $1.26 billion. Both Cloud and Telecom/Cable verticals did not perform well, resulting in a decline in the top and bottom-line figures.Juniper stock has lost 6.5% year to date, underpeforming the 3.5% gain of the industry it belongs to.Underlying Key FactorsIn the just reported quarter Juniper’s Cloud revenues declined 4% year over year and more than 9% sequentially to almost $345 million. Management cited spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers to be the major cause of decline. This is also anticipated to drag the top line down in the current quarter as well.Juniper stated that the ongoing transition of cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary reason behind low revenues. Moreover, an architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.The company’s Telecom/Cable revenues declined for the second consecutive quarter, when compared on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined 3.8% year over year to roughly $577 million in the third quarter.Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteFurther, the company’s expansion into low-margin markets like Asia-Pacific has negatively impacted customer mix. Additionally, the growing proportion of low-margin switch business in the product mix compared with the high-margin router business acts as a headwind for gross margin expansion.Unfavorable customer mix, higher costs of certain memory components and lower revenues resulted in 110 basis points (bps) decline in product gross margin.Costs incurred by spare parts in support of expansion of the company’s installed base and higher delivery costs related to growth in emerging markets dragged down services gross margin by 30 bps during the quarter.Notably, Juniper faces strong competition from peers like Arista Networks (ANET  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP  -  Free Report), which will continue to be a headwind for the company.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

921,JNPR,"Continuing with its upbeat performance for the fifth straight quarter, Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company’s expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.RevenuesFortinet reported third-quarter revenues of $374.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $371 million and up 18.2% year over year. Segment wise, Product revenues increased 7% year over year to $137.1 million, while Services revenues jumped 26% to $237.1 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by growth in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter also proved conducive to top-line growth.During the third quarter, the company witnessed 18% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth more than $250,000 and $500,000 climbed 26% and 50%, respectively.Billings were up 24% on a year-over-year basis to $431.7 million.Operating ResultsNon-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) gross profit jumped 20.8% from the year-ago quarter to $283.4 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 170 basis points (bps) to 75.7%, primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles. It also came ahead of management’s expectation of 75%.Furthermore, the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 250 bps year over year to 57%. In dollar terms, however, the figure advanced 13.1% to $213.2 million.Non-GAAP operating profit surged 52.5% to $70 million from approximately $45.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin expanded 420 bps to 18.7%, mainly attributed to improved gross margin and efficient cost management. Operating margin also surpassed the company’s guidance range of 16-17%.Fortinet’s non-GAAP earnings per share of 28 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than management’s guidance range of 22-23 cents and marked a solid improvement over the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 18 cents, driven mainly by higher revenues and efficient cost management.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.28 billion, up from $1.21 billion recorded at the end of the second quarter. Accounts receivable were $258 million compared with $271.1 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter.During the first three quarters of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $436.9 million. Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year came in at $315.2 million. Fortinet bought back 3.25 million shares for $124 million during the first three quarters of 2017.This month management also announced an increase of $400 million in share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization amount to $1 billion.GuidanceDespite reporting impressive third-quarter results, Fortinet lowered its revenue and billings guidance for the full year, and provided a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.For 2017, management now projects revenues in the range of $1.482-$1.490 billion (mid-point: $1.486 billion), down from the earlier guidance of $1.487-$1.495 billion (mid-point: $1.491 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.49 billion. Billings forecast has also been trimmed to $1.772-$1.787 billion from $1.775-$1.795 billion.Nevertheless, the company anticipates that its cost-management initiatives to drive its margins and earnings per share. Therefore, it raised its non-GAAP gross and operating margin projections to 75% and 17%, respectively. Earlier guidance ranges for gross and operating margin were 74.5-75% and 16.2%, respectively.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now estimated to come between $1.00 and $1.02 (mid-point $1.01), up from the range of 94-96 cents (mid point: 95 cents) predicted earlier.The company’s forecasts for the fourth quarter are slightly lackluster. Management expects revenues in the range of $404-$412 million (mid point: $408 million), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $416.59 million at mid-point. Billings are estimated in the range of $510-$525 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 28-30 cents (mid point: 29 cents). Although, it is a penny higher than the Consensus Estimate, but represents a year-over-year decline of 3.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 75-76%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be between 18% and 19%.Our TakeFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be optimistic on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans.Despite all these, shares of Fortinet dropped approximately 8% during yesterday’s after-hour trade, as investors seemed concerned over the company’s slowing revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last five quarters, the company’s revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet’s third-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 11.3-13.6%.In addition to this, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Check Point (CHKP  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Nonetheless, we believe Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company’s bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 170 bps gross-margin expansion in the third quarter. We anticipated this strategy will continue to improve the company’s bottom-line performances as well.Fortinet has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 33.1%, while the industry registered growth of 26.3% during the same time frame. Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2017 came in at $8.38 per share, compared with $7.30 per share reported in the year-ago period.GuidanceFor first-quarter fiscal 2018, F5 Networks expects revenues in the range of $515-$525 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $529 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be roughly 84.5%.

Non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be 31%.Price MovementIn the last one year, the company’s stock yielded a negative return of 8.9%, against the industry‘s gain of 16.5%.Our TakeF5 Networks reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favorable. Nonetheless, the company provided tepid first-quarter guidance.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by strength across all business segments along with higher software revenues. We believe that the company’s product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward. Moreover, these initiatives are expected to expand total addressable market and result in client wins.Better execution and focus on enterprise and service providers have placed F5 Networks well in the application delivery controller market. Nevertheless, a volatile spending atmosphere and competition from Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) remain concerns.Currently, F5 Networks carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(JNPR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 55 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.However, earnings decreased 5.2% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 2.1% to $1.26 billion. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 billion.The disappointing top-line growth can be attributed to weak performance in both Cloud and Telecom/Cable verticals.Cloud revenues declined 4% from the year-ago quarter and more than 9% sequentially to almost $345 million.

This factor is again expected to hurt top-line growth in the current quarter.Juniper stated that the ongoing transition by cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary cause behind low revenues. Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud customer base continues to expand.

926,JNPR,"Telecommunications is a vital industry witnessing rapid technological improvement. Unprecedented growth in high-speed mobile Internet traffic, particularly with respect to wireless data and video, has transformed this industry into the most evolving, inventive and keenly contested space.On the positive side, the new U.S. telecom regulatory body -- Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) -- has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. It is also likely to roll back several stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to spur growth in 2017. Moreover, the expected corporate tax reform will benefit telecom operators to extensively explore the booming businesses services market.A growing economy speeds up demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment. This in turn has boosted the demand for telecom equipment manufacturers.In addition, a major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo-political disturbances even when these lead to economic fluctuations. The need to remain connected is so very human, springing from our earliest tendencies to communicate with our fellow human beings. An era of digitization and technology is essentially built on this human craving. It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility. Consequently, any non-U.S. economic volatility is not expected to have an immediate impact on the industry.Future Drivers of Telecom Industry(1) 4G LTE Networks Thriving: According to a recent research report published by Ovum for industry association 5G Americas, 4G LTE connections have reached 2.37 billion globally at the end of second-quarter 2017. This indicates an improvement of a whopping 59% year over year. Per the report, LTE connections will reach 4.9 billion in 2022. At this rate, 4G LTE is set to outnumber 3G subscribers worldwide by 2020. By the end of 2021, global LTE market share will cross 53%.(2) Upcoming 5G Wireless Networks: According to a study commissioned by Qualcomm, fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology could result in real global economic growth by $3 trillion cumulatively from 2020 to 2035. Several industry researchers hold that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second), which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network.(3) Internet of Things (IoT): Internet of Things, which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP-address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network, is fast gaining market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models. Next-generation superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this context, IoT holds the potential to be the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.(4) Fiber Optic Networks: The fiber optic network is increasingly becoming the most sought-after technology for secure and fast data transmission over long distances. Going forward, the wireline industry will largely evolve around the fiber-based superfast gigabit data transmission network. Fiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure to meet the surging need for cloud-based business data, along with more video streaming services by individuals. Moreover, fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop, which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network.Our PicksAt this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks which carry a favorable Zacks Rank to cash in on future growth.Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) is a provider of Internet infrastructure solutions that enable Internet service providers and other telecommunications service providers to meet the demands resulting from the rapid growth of the Internet.

929,JNPR,"While investors avoid stocks that do not have juicy yields, it is true that these low-yield stocks have a solid history of dividend growth that lead to outperformance. This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation even in a volatile market.Inside The Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report): This California-based company is a provider of internet infrastructure solutions that enable internet service providers and other telecommunications service providers to meet demand resulting from the rapid growth of the internet.

930,JNPR,"The hype surrounding the cyber security industry has heated up this year given a surging stock market and increased cyberattacks. In fact, many stocks rallied to multi-year highs, suggesting that the industry is thriving. The latest quarterly earnings results bear testimony to this as most of the cyber security firms beat our earnings and revenue estimates, and raised their guidance for the full year (read: Cybersecurity ETFs Set to Rally After a Global Cyberattack).However, robust earnings failed to drive cybersecurity stocks and ETFs over the past month as the space has been hit by geopolitics lately. Let’s dig into the earnings results of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this industry:Cyber Security Earnings in FocusJuniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) reported Q2 earnings per share of 49 cents and revenues of $1.31 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents and $1.28 billion, respectively. For the third quarter, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 55-61 cents and revenues in the range of $1.02-$1.62 billion. Despite robust results, shares of JNPR are down 8.4% since its earnings announcement on July 25 after the closing bell.Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) beat our earnings estimate but missed on revenues when it reported fiscal first-quarter results on August 2, after the closing bell. Earnings per share came in at 15 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents but revenues of $1.17 billion fell shy of our estimated $1.2 billion. Symantec guided for the fiscal second quarter with revenues of $1.26-$1.29 billion and earnings per share in the range of 40-44 cents. The company raised its projections for the fiscal year. It now expects revenues of $5.16-$5.26 billion and earnings of $1.79-$1.89, up from the previous forecast of $5.10-$5.20 billion and $1.75-$1.85, respectively. However, shares of SYMC have tumbled 9.9% to date following its earnings announcement.Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP  -  Free Report) topped our estimates for both the top and the bottom lines by $4 million and 3 cents, respectively. It expects earnings per share of $1.18-$1.28 on revenues of $430-$465 million for the third quarter. For the full year, revenues and earnings are expected in the range of $1.85–$1.90 billion and $5.05-$5.25, respectively. The stock has plummeted 9.3% since its earnings announcement on July 20, before the opening bell (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Second-quarter earnings per share at Qualys (QLYS  -  Free Report) came in at 18 cents, 8 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $55 million matched our expectations. For the third quarter, Qualys expects revenues of $58.2–$58.9 million and earnings per share of 21-23 cents. For this year, it raised the revenue guidance to $226.8-$228.3 million from $225-$228 million and the earnings per share outlook to 87-91 cents from 81-86 cents. Shares of QLYS are up 6.7% to date following its earnings announcement on August 2, after the closing bell.Proofpoint (PFPT  -  Free Report) has shed 3.7% to date following the earnings announcement on July 27, after the closing bell. The company reported a loss per share of 39 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents but revenues outpaced our estimate by a marginal $2 million. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $130-$132 million and earnings per share in the range of 16-18 cents. For the full year, Proofpoint increased the revenue guidance to $503-$506 million from $496-$500 million and earnings per share outlook to 62-64 cents from $56-59 cents.ETFs in FocusThe string of earnings beat and solid outlook have put this niche area of the technology sector in focus for the days ahead. Currently, there are a couple of cyber security ETFs on investors’ radar:ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK  -  Free Report)The fund provides global exposure to the cybersecurity industry comprising companies that offer hardware, software, consulting and services to defend against cybercrime. It tracks the Prime Cyber Defense Index, holding 40 securities in its basket. It is well spread out across components with the in-focus five firms accounting for the top 10 holdings with over 3.5% share each.

931,JNPR,"On Aug 9, Zacks Investment Research downgraded F5 Networks, Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The downgrade can be primarily attributed to negative estimate revisions over the last 30 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has declined 1.1% to $6.28 over the said period. For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.87, reflecting a 5.1% decline over the same time frame.The negative estimate revision was primarily due to dismal third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, where both the top and the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis of $1.55 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share.Moreover, revenues of $517.8 million missed the consensus mark of $525 million. It also fell short of the lower range of management’s guidance range of $520–$530 million. Disappointing fourth quarter revenue guidance also fumed pessimism over the stock’s growth prospect.We also note that F5 Networks has lost 18% of its value year to date against 17.3% growth of the industry.Challenges for the CompanyCisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) is the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Cisco has tremendous engineering and marketing resources at its disposal. Although F5 Networks’ technology leads in the networking market, Cisco could become more competitive if it invests aggressively. In addition, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report), Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that could pose significant competitive threat on improved execution.Notably, F5 Networks continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, business mix and profitability, it also adds to integration risks. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which could impact organic growth in the long run.F5 Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) F5 Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | F5 Networks, Inc.

932,JNPR,"Continuing with its upbeat performance for the fourth straight quarter, Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2017, wherein revenues and earnings came ahead of the company’s expectations, and also surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fortinet’s adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of 14 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Adjusted earnings also marked a solid improvement over the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 3 cents, driven mainly by higher revenues and efficient cost management, which were partially offset by higher share counts.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the network security solution providing company posted earnings of 27 cents, which was higher than management’s guidance range of 19–20 cents and marked a 41.7% year-over-year improvement.Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc. QuoteRevenuesFortinet reported second-quarter revenues of $363.5 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $361 million and up 16.7% year over year. Segment wise, Product revenues increased 4% year over year to $142.7 million, while Services revenues jumped 26% to $220.8 million.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by growth in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments. A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also proved conducive to top-line growth.During the quarter, Fortinet added over 10,000 customers, bringing the total count to over 320,000.The company witnessed 21% year-over-year growth in the number of deals worth over $100,000, while the number of deals worth over $250,000 and $500,000 increased 5% and 10%, respectively.Billings were up 14% on a year-over-year basis to $426.9 million.Operating ResultsGross profit increased 18% from the year-ago quarter to $267.8 million. Moreover, gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 73.7%, primarily backed by sales of higher-value subscription bundles.Furthermore, the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 570 bps year over year to 55.6%. In dollar terms, however, the figure advanced 5.9% to $202.1 million.Non-GAAP operating profit jumped 82.7% to $65.7 million from approximately $36 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit margin expanded 650 bps to 18.1%, mainly attributed to improved gross margin and efficient cost management.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.21 billion, almost flat with $1.20 billion recorded at the end of the first quarter. Accounts receivable were $271.1million compared with $271.1 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter.During the first half of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $274.5 million. Free cash flow for the first two quarters came in at $174.6 million. Fortinet bought back 849,000 shares for $33.2 million during the first half of 2017.GuidanceBuoyed by a better-than-expected second-quarter performance, Fortinet raised its outlook for full-year 2017. For 2017, management now expects revenues in the range of $1.487–$1.495 billion (mid-point: $1.491 billion), up from the earlier guidance of $1.485–$1.495 billion (mid-point: $1.490 billion). Billings forecast has also been raised to $1.775–$1.795 billion from $1.770–$1.792 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.49 billion.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between 94 cents and 96 cents (mid-point 95 cents), up from of 89–91 cents (mid point: 90 cents) predicted earlier.Non-GAAP gross margin is now anticipated to come between 74.5% and 75% compared with the earlier forecasted range of 74%–75%. Non-GAAP operating margin is projected to come at 16.2%.However, the company’s revenue forecast for the third quarter is slightly disappointing. Management expects revenues in the range of $367–$373 million (mid point: $370 million), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $371.45 million at mid-point. Billings are estimated in the range of $417–$427 million.Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 22–23 cents (mid point: 22.5 cents). Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 75%, whereas non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be between 16% and 17%.Our TakeFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Despite persistent macro uncertainties, management seems to be optimistic on the back of a healthy network security market, solid product line-up and investment plans. Furthermore, the company’s upbeat guidance for full-year 2017 is encouraging.Despite all these, shares of Fortinet dropped over 4% in yesterday’s after-hour trade, as investors seemed concerned over the company’s slowing revenue growth rate. Notably, over the last four quarters, the company’s revenue growth rates have been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet’s second-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 15.9–17.8%.Moreover, competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Check Point (CHKP  -  Free Report), Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Palo Alto Networks, remains a concern.Nonetheless, we opine that Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company’s bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenue from these services, which helped it generate a 80 basis points gross margin expansion in the second quarter. We believe that this strategy will continue to improve the company’s bottom-line performances as well.Notably, the stock has returned 34.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s gain of 20.6% in the same time frame.Currently, Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

933,JNPR,"Shares of U.S. telecom behemoth, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) slipped to a 52-week low of $35.58 during the trading session on Sep 7. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $35.60, down 2.65% from the closing price on Sep 6.Over the past 52 weeks, shares of AT&T have ranged from a low of $35.58 to a high of $43.03. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 22.01 million.Why the Downturn?We are concerned about AT&T’s operation in a saturated wireless market, where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of smartphones, online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.Apart from saturation issues, competition is intense in the domestic wireless postpaid and prepaid industry. The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user (ARPU) has narrowed significantly, forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business.Stiff pricing competition in the industry is a genuine concern. In this scenario, the entry of non-wireless cable giants, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), has increased competition.In order to counter competition, AT&T continues to offer several low-priced service plans and attractive promotional discounts, both for individual customers and business entities. Although such offers increase the company’s top line by adding customers, but the costs incurred during marketing campaigns and advertisements is likely to affect the company’s margins. This may further led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for these companies.The company’s wireline division continues to struggle with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by the cable companies. In the last reported second-quarter 2017, total wireline broadband connections were 1.384 million, down 5.2% year over year. IP-broadband was pegged at 992,000.Additionally, stringent regulatory measures and union issues are other major headwinds.All these factors have led to the company’s share price hitting a new 52-week low.Price PerformanceAT&T has not been performing well of late. Over the past six months, shares of AT&T have declined 15.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%.Moreover, when compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance is pretty dreary, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 4.5% over the same time span. Sales Estimates on a DownswingWe note that the sales estimate for AT&T has moved down for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.Sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 1.34% and 0.74%, respectively. Additionally, for 2017, sales are expected to drop 1.69%.Earnings Surprise AT&T does not have an impressive track record with respect to earnings surprise. This is because the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only in the last reported quarter, while keeping in line with the same in the remaining three of the previous four quarters.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAT&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector include Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report), ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) and America Movil S.A. B. de C.V.

Revenue (TTM) Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Juniper Networks, Inc.

Per MarketsandMarkets, the cybersecurity market is expected to reach $231.94 billion by 2022 from $137.85 billion in 2017, at a CAGR of 11%.Thus, Juniper’s acquisition of Cyphort comes at an opportune time. However, increasing competition from Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) post its acquisition of cyber-security solutions provider Sourcefire is a major headwind for Juniper.Nevertheless, Juniper’s enhanced security portfolio, the accelerated adoption of its cloud-based products (particularly in data center), growing demand for its switching product (the QFX line) and the recently unveiled Cloud-Grade networking that includes telemetry, automation and machine learning abilities, are anticipated to boost its top line in the near term.Zacks Rank and Key PicksJuniper Networks currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

935,JNPR,"On Sep 1, Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The upgrade can primarily be attributed to the recent launch of its new security solution Juniper Contrail Security as well as the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results.In the last quarter, Juniper’s earnings increased 14% from the year-ago quarter to 57 cents per share. The figure was ahead of management’s expectation of 54 cents (+/- 3 cents). Revenues, which increased 7.2% year over year to $1.31 billion, comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and management’s expectation of $1.28 billion (+/- $30 million). The year-over-year revenue growth was much better than management’s expectation of 5%.Juniper stock has lost 2.3% year to date, outperforming the 2.6% decline of the industry it belongs to.Growth CatalystsWe believe Juniper’s latest introduction, Contrail Security has boosted the growth potential of the company. The security solution ensures protection for applications that are deployed in volume-loaded heterogeneous cloud-based environments. Hence, this new launch coupled with Juniper’s existing Software Defined Secure networks (SDSN) will drive the company’s top line going forward.Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteNotably, Juniper has witnessed accelerated demand and adoption of its SDSN platforms. In the second quarter, the platform was enhanced with security enforcements, which now protect data transmission and computing on enterprise networks as well as public and private clouds from breaches.Juniper added many prominent names to its customer base during the last reported quarter. CloudSeeds selected Juniper’s Contrail Networking software-defined networking (SDN) solution. Coloclue adopted Juniper’s NVF Solution. i3D.net also selected Juniper’s SDSN platform for network security.Can it Sustain the Momentum?The company recently unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking, which covers telemetry, automation and machine learning processes. This is also expected to drive the top line in the near term. We anticipate strong adoption of Juniper’s cloud-based products (particularly in data center), growing demand for its switching product (the QFX line) and stringent cost control along with shareholder friendly initiatives to help the stock maintain its momentum in the long run.Key PicksOther stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report), Infineon (IFNNY  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).

936,JNPR,"Dividend is a major source of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.Dividend paying stocks are primarily mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Their market leading position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pay high yields.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stocks, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Zacks Rank Less than 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum.

937,JNPR,"Shares of Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report), a leading player in the field of technology innovations, reached a new 52-week high of $122.37 during the trading session on Aug 28, before closing a tad lower at $121.33 (up 1.39% from the closing price of Aug 25).Over the past 52 weeks, shares of Harris have ranged from a low of $88.89 to a high of $122.37. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 772.81k. The stock has a market cap of $14.49 billion.Comparison With Broader IndustryHarris has been performing well of late. Over the last three months, the stock price has moved up 9.8% as against the industry’s decline of 6.0%.When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks favorable, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 1.0%.Taking the stable performance of the stock into consideration, we expect Harris to scale higher in the coming quarters.Positive Earnings SurpriseHarris delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.99%. The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeOne of the majorfactor that played a pivotal role in driving the share price of Harris to a new 52-week high is the company’s latest announcement on dividend hike. The move indicates the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underlines confidence in business growth.The company raised quarterly dividend by 8% to 57 cents per share (or $2.28 annually) from 53 cents (or $2.12 annually). Approved by the company’s board of directors, this new payout will be made on Sep 22, 2017, to stockholders of record as on Sep 8. This is the 16th such annual dividend increase by the company.Meanwhile, William M. Brown, Chairman, President and CEO of the company, anticipates 2018 to be a year of growth and is hopeful about its long-term outlook. The company expects earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) for fiscal 2018 in the band of $5.85 to $6.05. Revenues for the same are projected in the range of $6.02-$6.14 billion. As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend-yielding firm is much coveted. Investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on. The dividend rise is likely to further improve the stock.Moreover, being a leading technology innovator, Harris has been consistently focusing on business innovation in a bid to deliver some of the best technology and products in the industry. Notably, the company had been selected by Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) to upgrade mission system avionics for the F-35 Lightning II as part of the technology.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHarris currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the Computer and Technology sector are InterDigital, Inc.

938,JNPR,"Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio. However, the terms of the deal were not revealed.Notably, the Plano, TX-based Kodiak Networks is a provider of broadband push-to-talk (PTT) for commercial customers. Therefore, this acquisition is a smart move by Motorola as it is in line with existing software portfolio of this Chicago-based company. In fact, the buyout broadened the company’s offerings for mobile network operators, particularly in commercial markets.Motorola’s WAVE PTT portfolio has been boosted by the acquisition of the PTT firm.

940,JNPR,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsJuniper reported second-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 57 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and increased 14% from the year-ago quarter. The figure was almost in line with management’s expectation of 54 cents (+/- 3 cents).The growth was driven by solid revenues, which increased 7.2% year over year to $1.31 billion, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and its own expectation of $1.28 billion (+/- $30 million). The year-over-year revenue growth was much better than management’s expectation of 5%.Despite DRAM pricing issues and unfavorable product and customer mix hurting the company’s gross margin in the rest of 2017, we believe that current guidance is a bit conservative.Based on the first-half results (earnings up 18.4% on 9.1% revenue growth), we believe that Juniper has significant growth opportunity based on the strong adoption of its cloud products (particularly in data center), which jumped 32% year-over-year in the reported quarter. Notably, four out of top 10 customers were cloud providers in the reported quarter.Moreover, strong demand for its switching product (the QFX line) will drive top-line growth. Further, stringent cost control and shareholder friendly initiatives will aid the stock to maintain upside against the broader market in 2017.Top-Line DetailProduct revenues (70.1% of total revenue) increased 6.4% on a year-over-year basis to $917.2 million. On the other hand, services revenues (29.9% of total revenue) climbed 9% to $391.7 million.The networking solutions provider witnessed year-over-year revenue growth in the Switching product category, which surged 31.9% to $276 million. Management stated that cloud data center provider’s ongoing transition to 100-gigabit infrastructure drove growth.Routing category revenues remained almost flat at $572.5 million. Both MX and PTX products had a strong quarter.However, Security revenues declined 12.1% to $68.7 million. Juniper launched an enhanced Software-Defined Secure Networks (SDSN) platform. The company also expanded its public cloud offering with the introduction of virtual SRX 4.0.Geographically, the company registered a year-over-year increase in revenues from America (11.2%) and Asia Pacific (9.3%), while revenues from EMEA decreased 4%.Operational DetailsAdjusted gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.5%, primarily due to unfavorable product (more volumes of switch) and customer mix. The company expanded footprint into certain strategic APAC customers, which are low margin business. Gross margin was lower than management’s guidance of 62.5% (+/- 0.5%).As percentage of revenues, general & administrative (G&A), sales & marketing (S&M) and research & development (R&D) expenses decreased 60 bps, 170 bps and 30 bps, respectively on a year-over-year basis.In dollar terms, total operating expense remained almost flat at $495.8 million, lower than management’s guidance of $500 million (+/- $5 million). This was primarily due to lower variable compensation and stringent cost control. Operating expense as percentage of revenues declined 260 bps to 37.9%.Hence, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 bps to 24.2%, which was better than management’s guidance of almost 23.5%.Cash Flow/Share BuybackTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of Jun 30 were $4.22 billion as compared with $4.04 billion as of Mar 31. Juniper’s net cash flows from operations were $299 million, as compared with $545.3 million in first-quarter 2017.The company repurchased $125 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends in the reported quarter.GuidanceJuniper anticipates revenues of approximately $1.32 billion (+/- $30 million) for third-quarter 2017, reflecting almost 5% growth, which falls within management’s long-term revenue growth expectation of 3–6%.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 62% (+/- 0.5%). The company expects non-GAAP operating expenses of $500 million (+/- $5 million), and non-GAAP operating margin of almost 24.1%.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 58 cents per share (+/- $0.03).Juniper expects 2017 revenues to grow near the midpoint of its long-term model range of 3% to 6%. For the rest of 2017, management expects non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to the first-half figure (lower than long-term expectation of 63%), due to unfavorable customer and product mix along with higher cost for certain memory components.The company expects to achieve long-term operating expense as percentage of revenue guidance of 39% in 2017.Management expects continued strong cash flow generation and plans to return approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

941,JNPR,"The third-quarter reporting cycle will be seeing releases from 722 companies, including 180 S&P 500 members, this week (Oct 23-27).Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR  -  Free Report) are set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.Let’s find out what these companies have to offer investors in this quarter.Corning is well known for the Gorilla Glass that has gained significant traction from increasing usage in smartphones.We expect strong demand for fiber products to primarily drive growth, which will boost Optical Communications revenues.Additionally, Gorilla Glass 5 is also anticipated to contribute significantly. We believe that a likely increase in dollar content from Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) newly launched iPhones will benefit Corning’s top-line growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Optical Communications and Specialty Materials (Gorilla Glass is reported under this segment) revenues are currently pegged at $878 million and $340 million, respectively.However, weakness in the Display Technologies segment is a headwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment is currently pegged at $752 million.Shares of Corning have returned 23.9% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 21% rally.On the other hand, Juniper is expected to disappoint investors due to sluggish sales in its cloud computing segment. The weakness is likely to hurt switching business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Switching segment is currently pegged at $276 million.Moreover, Juniper is facing significant pricing pressure amid intense competition in the network equipment market from the likes of Arista Networks Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and others including white-box vendors. This has hurt the company’s competitive position in the router market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Routing segment is currently pegged at $589 million.Additionally, Juniper’s expansion into low-margin Asia-Pacific market adversely impacted customer mix. Further, growing proportion of low-margin switch business in the product mix as compared with high-margin router business is a headwind for gross margin expansion. Additionally, higher DRAM memory prices are expected to hurt gross margin in the quarter.Juniper’s shares have lost 7.9% of its value year to date compared with the 3.1% decline of its industry.Unfavorable Rank, Negative ESPWe believe both Corning and Juniper are unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Texas Instruments Inc.

In the last quarter, Juniper delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%.Nevertheless, third-quarter results are anticipated to suffer from weakness in the cloud computing segment.

In the last quarter, routing category revenues remained almost flat at $572.5 million.

In the last quarter, the platform was enhanced with security enforcements, which protects data transmission and computing on enterprise networks as well as public and private clouds from breaches.Moreover, we believe Juniper’s latest introduction, Contrail Security, which ensures protection for applications that are deployed in volume-loaded heterogeneous cloud-based environments is a key catalyst.The company recently unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking, which covers telemetry, automation and machine learning processes.

Reported revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $525 million.Revenues were boosted by 6.6% increase in service revenues and 1.6% increase in Product revenues on a year-over-year basis.Notably, F5 Networks’ “Good, Better, Best” (GBB) pricing strategies and higher competencies of BIG-IQ platform also helped in streamlining product portfolio and driving year-over-year revenue growth.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from the Americas were up 6% and contributed 57% to total revenue. EMEA increased 4% and accounted for 23% of total revenue. Asia-Pacific was up 3% on a year-over-year basis, representing 15% of total revenue while Japan revenues decreased 8% and represented 4% of total revenue.By verticals, Enterprise, Service providers and Government (including 6% from the U.S. federal) accounted for 65%, 20% and 14% of total revenue, respectively.The company’s distributors Ingram Micro, Tech Data (TECD  -  Free Report) and Westcon accounted for 16.8%, 12.2% and 19.1%, of total revenue, respectively.Operating ResultsF5 Networks’ non-GAAP gross profit (excluding amortization of intangible assets, other one-time items and stock-based compensation) was up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $435.5 million.

However, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favorable. Nonetheless, the company provided tepid fourth-quarter revenue guidance.It is worth mentioning that the company’s GBB pricing strategy and its BIG-IQ platform remain tailwinds. Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by strength across all business segments along with higher software revenues.We believe that the company’s product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward. Moreover, these initiatives are expected to expand its total addressable market and result in client wins.Better execution and focus on enterprise and service providers have placed F5 Networks well in the application delivery controller market. Nevertheless, a volatile spending atmosphere and competition from Juniper Networks Inc.
