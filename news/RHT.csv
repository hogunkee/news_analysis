11,RHT,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

Prices reversed higher, with Brent crude up 1.6% to $74.25 per barrel and West Texas intermediate rising 1.3% and trading above $66 a barrel. Prices rose despite reports that Iran had softened its opposition to an agreement to increase production, making a boost in oil supply more likely.Much like the central banks that stimulated their economies through buying bonds and holding down interest rates, OPEC and Russia agreed in November 2016 to reduce oil output to bolster glut-weakened oil prices. The strategy was effective and, like the central banks that have gradually tapered their stimulus programs, OPEC appears set to release the cap on its production.How quickly they might do that is the question global energy and financial markets are asking.

29,RHT,"The coalition of companies jockeying with Amazon.com (AMZN) for a lucrative Pentagon computing contract is far bigger than previously reported, signaling added heft behind efforts to keep the work from going exclusively to the world's largest cloud services provider.SAP America (SAP), General Dynamics' (GD) CSRA unit, Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among at least nine companies that have coordinated their opposition to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, according to emails obtained by Bloomberg News. The Amazon cloud services business leads the market and is widely perceived to be the front-runner.The most active members of the coalition trying to fend off an Amazon cloud win are Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and International Business Machines (IBM), according to two people familiar with the matter. Other companies involved include Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Bloomberg has reported.SAP and the others aren't considered top contenders for the contract. But the companies are banding together to fight the Pentagon's plans to award it to a single bidder. They're concerned it could disrupt their established business model for obtaining military contracts.The Pentagon announced a winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar cloud services contract in March.It has since paused the bidding process for the project. The reason is it would transition massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. The government has said it still plans to award the contract by September.Representatives for SAP, Red Hat, CSRA and VMware declined to comment.The interest is widespread among technology companies in pressing the Pentagon to change its procurement approach. For one, it indicates the importance of the lucrative contract. Providers are struggling to catch up to Amazon cloud. The same is true for firms that sell software and other technology to federal agencies.Companies have begun conversations about jointly bidding for the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, sources say.The Pentagon has tapped Dana Deasy to be its new chief information officer to oversee the contract. Members of the coalition welcome the move, sources say.""Dana Deasy is a highly professional, seasoned, transformational CIO who will lead the DoD's technology efforts with distinction,"" Oracle's Senior Vice President Ken Glueck said in a statement.Deasy's comments before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in May pleased the coalition, sources say. While he didn't address the JEDI contract specifically, he talked about the importance of using multiple cloud providers.Deasy previously worked as global chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at a time when the company made major investments to transition to a public cloud. He held similar positions at the North American unit of General Motors (GM), Tyco International and Siemens' (SIEGY) North American operation.""Under Deasy's leadership, the department will gradually consolidate its disparate networks, data centers and cloud efforts to manage them at the enterprise level,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement Monday.To advance their agenda, the tech allies have been strategizing by email and phone. They've courted trade and mainstream media and lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House, Bloomberg has reported.The competitive cloud coalition has notched some wins. The House committee in charge of federal spending approved a Defense Department funding bill this month. It would halt funding for the contract until the Pentagon submits a strategy to sustain competition and use multiple cloud-service providers.It is the third attempt by lawmakers to influence the process. The full House is scheduled to take up the spending measure this week.

36,RHT,"Like big-game hunters zeroing in on their quarry, the co-managers of $1.7 billion Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) are single-minded about how they stalk stocks. ""We focus on looking for companies whose innovation produces durable growth and competitive advantage,"" co-manager Dave Carlsen said about the process he and co-managers Clay Brethour and Elizabeth Jones use.X Their process has worked. The fund's average annual return was better than the S&P 500's over the trailing one, three, five and 10 years ending Dec. 31. That makes it eligible to earn an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds that are members of that elite club are in the small minority of funds outperforming in all four time periods. In 2017, the fund was up 25.44% vs. 23.92% on average for midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct and 21.83% for the S&P 500.The fund achieved its gain last year with help from leading stocks Align Technology (ALGN), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Red Hat (RHT), which are up 143%, 131% and 78% respectively since the start of 2017.MSCI (MSCI), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) are additional leaders that helped to boost the fund, gaining 67%, 61% and 60%.MSCI is a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It's up 5% in this young year.IBD readers recognize that Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1213.51.Facebook, another IBD 50 stock, is also near a buy point — 184.35 in its case, having broken out from a new flat base last week.Brethour, Carlsen and Jones are with Kornitzer Capital Management. They subadvise the fund for Buffalo. The trio — who are ages 48, 49 and 53 — talked with IBD from their offices in Mission, Kansas, about how they hunt for winning stocks.List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersList Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersMF Category PerformanceClick Here To See All Articles In The Best Mutual Funds Performance ReportIBD: What's the central theme in your overall investment approach?Dave Carlsen: This is about seeking innovation in companies. We're looking for companies with innovation, with a new idea that's accepted in the marketplace and leads to shareholder wealth creation or a competitive advantage. We're looking for disruptive ideas that lead to significant share gain or the creation of a brand-new marketplace.We buy positions in growth companies that can grow and gain a competitive advantage regardless of the overall macro economy.IBD: The fund's outperformance over four time periods is rare. How has the fund achieved that consistency?Elizabeth Jones: We've been working together since 2004. That helps. And we each have our strengths and weaknesses. That diversification of strengths has led to more consistent results. When one of us has an interest in a stock that is out of favor, the others might choose stocks that are in favor.That minimizes our downside and maximizes our upside.IBD: Clay or Dave, would you add anything?Clay Brethour: Our process seeks companies that are beneficiaries of 26 secular growth trends. With those growth trends, they have a tailwind no matter what the macro economic situation looks like.IBD: What are some of those trends?Brethour: They're things like the aging demographics, the push for health care cost containment. We look for areas that benefit from durable trends and stay away from here-today-gone-tomorrow fads.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what do you like about Facebook and what if any are your concerns?Carlsen: The growth in digital advertising impresses us. It's a big market that continues to disrupt. Google and Facebook are winning the lion's share of growth in digital advertising.The time that users spend on Facebook is remarkable, so advertisers like it. Revenues were up 45% in the September quarter vs. the prior year. That gives them pricing (power), which contributes to earnings growth.They're investing in short-form video content, which should build their community and drive consumer engagement higher. And with mobile revenue growth especially robust, Facebook remains well positioned.IBD: Why did you add to your Amazon stake recently?Jones: In Q2 we added to it. We gravitate to smaller companies but make exceptions for exceptional companies. And despite its size, Amazon is still growing rapidly, and it's probably the most innovative company in the world.We define value as translating an idea or innovation into a good or service that customers are willing to pay for. That's what (Amazon founder Jeff) Bezos has done. And he took a risk. He had to create an online marketplace with enough inventory and low enough prices to create value.He innovated in other ways. He needed Amazon Web Services to run his own infrastructure, and he monetized that by offering it to other companies. He realized he could provide content, so we got Amazon Prime Video, Music, Reading. And he wrapped that around the membership offering.We should have owned Amazon sooner. We're happy to own it now.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's exclusive Leaderboard list of top stocks. On Dec. 26, the company trumpeted its biggest holiday sales season ever.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN), the dental braces maker, has pulled back recently. As of your latest disclosure, if you still liked it, tell me why?Brethour: They dominate the clear aligner market and take market share from metal braces, and they continue to expand outside the U.S.(After) they got added to the S&P 500 (in June), they were one of the top four or five performing stocks in the S&P for the year, so some of the (recent) pullback is profit-taking.People underestimate the complexity of manufacturing a customized product (like Align's). And the company is aggressive about expanding into more complex treatment cases.We like it because it benefits everyone. It gives consumers a product they prefer. It helps dental and orthodontic practices. And it gives shareholders good returns and margins.IBD: Any concern about Red Hat's recent pullback after reporting third quarter results?Carlsen: The pullback was basically a case of (not meeting) high expectations. Still, its 20% quarterly (earnings per share) growth is not something you see from everyone in the tech sector. We expect it to continue.What we like is that Red Hat is in the right spot for the evolution of the cloud. They've built a big installed base of users for their Linux enterprise operating system on corporate servers and in the public and private cloud infrastructure. They allow a company's on-premises infrastructure to mesh with the public cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. The public cloud is cheaper and more efficient for some uses. A company might keep its email on the public cloud, for example, but they may want to keep product development on-premise for security.Red Hat is positioned to bridge the gap between the private and public cloud, making innovation more efficient going forward.IBD: Why did Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) drop recently after making a great run up?Jones: I don't think the pullback was anything in particular. A lot of growth stocks pulled back. Also, Electronic Arts (EA), another gaming company, made some changes to a new release, reducing the number of microtransactions that players buy on the side, and maybe that caused collateral damage to Take-Two and Activision (ATVI).But we don't believe those will impact the company's ability to meet our projections in the long run.Historically, the company is at a disadvantage by the boom-bust cycle in games releases. They'd have a lot of sales, then dramatic declines. But that's changing due to online gaming and multiplayer gaming, which are extending individual game lifetimes. Instead of new releases every five to seven years, the company is shifting to incremental releases delivered digitally, which have a higher margin and more opportunities for microtransactions, those side purchases by players that give them an advantage in a game. Those are why the stock has done well this year.In addition, the market anticipates two new releases next year. One will be Red Dead Redemption 2, which is highly anticipated.IBD: Why do you like MSCI (MSCI), which for example runs many indexes tracked by investors?Brethour: About 98% of their revenues are recurring. They have significant cash flow. And they only need a low capital expenditure to build their business going forward.They're a beneficiary of the shift to passive investing. As active managers, we are aware of that shift and want to seek ways to benefit from it. MSCI is a clear choice. Trillions of dollars are benchmarked to their indices.And now they're laying the groundwork to become the standard for ESG (environmental-, social- and governance-impact) investing. That should provide an additional avenue of growth going forward.IBD: Elizabeth, you are an M.D. How do you use that expertise as a manager for this fund?Jones: My experience in pricing medicine has given me unique insight to health care. I spend 70% to 75% of my time on health care in the fund, looking for things that offer consumers a good value. As Dave mentioned, we look for innovators. The key for them is having value. It's got to be a good deal for the consumer.With my background, I can assess that, especially in terms of the interface between doctors and patients.IBD: Dave and Clay, do either of you have unusual career trajectories?Carlsen: Like Clay, my career path has been pretty traditional.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsIf You're Looking For Actionable Stocks, Check Our Stock Lists Page For Stocks Near Buy Zones, Stocks Hitting New Highs, Sector Leaders, Tech Leaders, IPO Leaders And MoreYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeWhere To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

37,RHT,"The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average edged lower in afternoon trading Wednesday as earnings reports from Micron Technology (MU), FedEx (FDX), Stitch Fix (SFIX) and Red Hat (RHT) got the most attention.X Micron fared the best. Shares were up 4% after the maker of memory and data-storage chips reported a 71% rise in sales to $6.8 billion. Micron is getting support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a recent breakout over a 33.03 buy point.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.4%.The House passed the GOP tax bill, meaning the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is ready for President Trump's signature.Money flowed out of bonds again. After hitting a nine-month high Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield added 3 basis points Wednesday to 2.49%.Oil and gas, steel, and mining stocks outperformed, while restaurant stocks and some health care names lagged.Among the day's movers, Biogen (BIIB) added nearly 2% as it works on the right side of a base. Credit Suisse upgraded the biotech to outperform from neutral and raised its price target to 385 from 321.FedEx also did well, up more than 3%, after reporting strong earnings late Tuesday. The last proper entry for FedEx was when it reclaimed the 50-day moving average in late November.Elsewhere, longtime leader Red Hat gapped below the 50-day moving average despite reporting another impressive quarter of growth. Shares slumped 5% to 122.25. The software leader had been running higher for months after a breakout from a base in February. After several trips to the 50-day line already, it was well-extended in price ahead of the results.Stitch Fix recovered a good chunk of a 17% intraday loss, but shares still lost 6.5%. Earnings and sales at the new issue topped expectations, but Wall Street is still focused on high selling, general and administrative expenses at the company.  SG&A expenses made up 40.5% of total revenue in the latest quarter, up from 35.4% in the year-ago period.Top gainers in the IBD 50 included financials Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) and Essent Group (ESNT) as well as managed-care firm Centene (CNC). All three showed gains of 2% or more. After a visit to the 50-day line last week, Centene is back above a 98.82 entry.Meanwhile, the latest Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed a jump in bullishness in the latest week to 64.1% from 61.9%, but the stock market has been dealing with extreme bullishness for a while now. The latest reading was the 11th in a row in what Investors Intelligence calls the ""danger zone"" of 60% or higher. The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at extremes when it comes to identifying market tops and bottoms.RELATED:Bitcoin Tumbles As Coinbase Set To Resume Bitcoin Cash Trades Amid ProbeSenate OKs GOP Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostMicron Stock Pops As This 'New Normal' Dawns On Wall Street

40,RHT,"Think of Red Hat (RHT) as a technology company that has reinvented itself not just once, but twice in 15 years.There aren't too many of those around — Netflix (NFLX) comes to mind. And the payoff can be huge for companies that manage to pull it off.While Netflix morphed from DVD renter to movie streamer to new-age Hollywood powerhouse, Red Hat's reinvention is tied to the rise of cloud computing. Like many traditional suppliers of information technology, it has been pressured to adapt.""Red Hat has gambled on a couple of significant cloud technologies or trends,"" said Dennis Smith, an analyst at Gartner Group. ""One of them has come up aces. That's container technology and container adoption. The other bet is on a multicloud strategy. The jury is still out on that.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe software maker's original claim to fame: It led the commercialization of Linux open-source software. Its Linux operating system runs servers in data centers operated by most large U.S. companies.Two years ago, bearish analysts said Red Hat faced a day of reckoning as Corporate America shifted more business workloads to cloud-computing specialists like Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN).""Public"" cloud service providers rent customers shared computing infrastructure, including servers and data storage systems. Aside from AWS, the biggest cloud players are Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM).Bearish analysts warned that companies would buy less of Red Hat's software for their private data centers and that it could be shut out from the cloud. One worry was that Amazon Web Services offered customers its own version of open-source Linux for free.But Red Hat already pivoted from its core Linux business. The company aimed to build a cloud-friendly app development platform.It also charged into a new cloud technology called containers. By using Red Hat's software containers, corporate developers build custom apps in private data centers and move workloads to public clouds.Red Hat's OpenShift platform combines Linux, container technology, cloud automation tools and software-defined networking for data storage. The OpenShift cloud product is priced 10 times higher than Red Hat's enterprise Linux software.""Our software runs everywhere, (in) on-premise and multiple public clouds. That's part of the story,"" Chief Executive James Whitehurst told Investor's Business Daily in an interview.""The other piece of the story is that, oh, Red Hat isn't dead. It has a much larger addressable market opportunity because Linux is only so big but this next thing is potentially 10 times larger,"" Whitehurst added. ""That combination — Red Hat is not dead and its addressable market — is why you're seeing so much interest in Red Hat and the stock.""Cloud computing marks the latest evolution in Red Hat's business model. In the early 1990s, Red Hat developed its own version of Linux, open-source software. The company gave the software away for free, then sold shrink-wrapped boxed versions in hopes of making money from technical support.A decade later, the Raleigh, N.C.-based company released Red Hat Enterprise Linux for corporate customers. With additional features, RHEL targeted computer servers in on-premise data centers.RHEL enabled the software maker to shift to a subscription-based business model. The company provided customers with software updates via the web.Red Hat next moved into virtualization, or software that enables servers to share business workloads. In that market, it took on powerhouses VMware (VMW) and Microsoft.As the tech industry slowly bounced back from the 2008-09 global recession, Red Hat stock did OK. But it never caught on fire like that of Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in software-as-a-service. One investor concern was that Red Hat's Linux-related growth might be limited as new rivals leveraged open-source software.In 2017, Red Hat showed signs of gaining traction in cloud computing. Analysts focused on its early lead in container technology. Shares shot up 71% in 2017 and have gained 40% this year.Revenue rose 21% to $2.98 billion in the year ended Feb. 28. Adjusted profit increased 31% to $2.98 a share.At its analyst day in May, the company said its emerging technology segment now has an annual $200 million run rate. Most of that comes from cloud revenue, such as OpenShift.""While RHEL still stands at Red Hat's core, it is clear that OpenShift is its future,"" Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron said in a report to clients.Gartner's Smith says that large RHEL customers have given OpenShift a boost. He says it's unclear if OpenShift will keep its momentum with smaller RHEL users.Red Hat isn't alone in aiming to make it easier for companies to develop apps that can run on multiple public clouds. It competes with Pivotal Software (PVTL), spun off by VMware, Docker and Rancher Labs.Red Hat has an edge, Smith says, as companies steer away from proprietary technologies that could lock them into one vendor for years. The Linux leader's tools enable companies to develop applications that run on cloud infrastructure, a market called platform-as-a-service, or PaaS.""Red Hat provides the most flexible PaaS environment from an infrastructure standpoint, allowing users to runs its solution on private data centers or in any public cloud,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Adam Holt said in his note to clients. ""Pivotal has a similar offering to Red Hat, but not as broad or deep.""Red Hat partnered with AWS, by far the biggest cloud service provider, in 2017. They aimed to make it easier for OpenShift customers to move workloads to the AWS cloud platform.At its investor day in May, Red Hat and Microsoft announced they will jointly offer OpenShift as a managed service on the Azure cloud platform.""While not a needle-mover short term, the Microsoft partnership represents a sizable call option for future growth,"" Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst said in a report.Reports surfaced in March that Google's cloud-computing unit was eyeing an acquisition of the Linux leader to boost its presence in the corporate market.""I could see why any cloud provider might say owning Red Hat has value because it would give them more ability to move workloads to their cloud,"" Redhat's Whitehurst said. ""But any cloud provider would also have to recognize that we are neutral and weigh the benefits of having an edge moving workloads with the dis-synergy associated with us losing our Switzerland status.""The company also has been a steady acquirer of startups.In 2006, it bought JBoss for $350 million. With the purchase, Red Hat gained popular enterprise application development tools. In 2015, the company bought cloud automation specialist Ansible for a reported $150 million.In January, Red Hat acquired container platform developer CoreOS for $250 million, marking its largest deal since buying JBoss.""OpenShift will be more formidable once it integrates the recently acquired CoreOS,"" said a Cowen & Co. report on container technology. ""Although we estimate that OpenShift was only 3% of total Red Hat billings (a sales growth metric) in fiscal 2018, we forecast that it will eclipse $300 million in 2020 billings, equating to 7% of total.""The report went on to say: ""Given its financial resources, container focus, and strong recent track record with (mergers), we believe that Red Hat will perhaps uniquely, continue to act as a consolidator of some of the very best innovation in the container market.""Shares of Red Hat gained 1.1% on Friday to 171.06.RELATED LINKS:Sell And Take Profits Or Hold?

Big stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their runs.All of these stocks are recent breakouts, but they have had some trouble holding in buy areas. That reflects the sideways stock market action of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and, until last week, the Nasdaq composite.Also the breakout volume generally has been light-to-lackluster, with the partial exception of Alibaba. That suggests a lack of conviction buying by mutual funds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That's OK, but you'd like to see trading activity at least 40%-50% more than average on a breakout.Alibaba, IBD Stock of the Day on Friday, briefly topped the entry last Tuesday but pulled back. The top Chinese stock had been finding resistance at the 200 level for several weeks.Alibaba rose 2.3% to 208.95 Monday.The cloud-based software firm is known for its business management products, but has expanded into other fields.

45,RHT,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose modestly Monday morning as Bitcoin futures surged at Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) from their Sunday debut.X S&P 500 standouts Micron Technology (MU), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Red Hat (RHT) all have Composite Ratings of at least 95 and have recently found support at their 50-day moving averages. All three report report earnings over the next two weeks.S&P 500 futures rose nearly 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.15% above fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.2%.All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of 95 or better near the start of big runs. Micron Technology boasts a 95 Composite Rating while Adobe Systems and Red Hat have best-possible 99 CRs.The 50-day moving average and its related 10-week line are key technical areas where institutional buyers often step in to add shares. It can offer new buying opportunities for investors.The digital media and marketing software firm reports fiscal Q4 results Thursday. Wall Street expects per-share profit rising 28% to $1.15, with revenue up 21% to $1.948 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Adobe Systems plunged more than 6% on Monday, Dec. 4, just undercutting its 50-day moving average. Shares fell again on Tuesday, but rebounded to retake that key support in above-average volume, though in lighter trade than in the prior two days of selling. Adobe closed Friday at 173.57, about 6% off its Nov. 28 peak.Oracle (ORCL), another major software maker but with a so-so 76 Composite Rating, also reports quarterly results late Thursday as well.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The memory chip giant reports on Dec. 19.  Micron's earnings should skyrocket 587.5% to $2.20 with sales surging 61% to $6.387 billion. Credit surging demand and prices for memory chips, though Morgan Stanley warned memory prices could cool.Spurred by that warning, Micron tumbled sharply from late November to Dec. 4, falling below its 50-day line along the way. The chipmaker has rallied for the last four sessions, just retaking its 50-day line on Thursday. Shares popped intraday Friday, rising to 44.58, but closing up just 1 cent at 43.21.The Linux software giant also reports Dec. 19. Red Hat is expected to report earnings per share of 70 cents, up 15%. Revenue should climb 19% to $734 million.Like Adobe, Red Hat retreated from a record high on Nov. 28 to tumble to just below its 50-day line on Dec. 4. The stock quickly regained that key level over the next four sessions, though on decelerating volume. Red Hat closed Friday at 125.29, 3% off its peak.RELATED:Cboe Bitcoin Futures Launch TodayIBD 50: Time To Buy Stocks In These New Sectors?The Big Picture: Nasdaq, S&P 500 Tell Different TalesDon't Give Up On These 5 Top Stocks Just Below Buy PointsThese 5 Industrial Stocks Are Trading Near Buy PointsStocks Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Earnings

46,RHT,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

48,RHT,"Dow Jones futures rose solidly Monday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Apple (AAPL) skyrocketed last week, pushing the Nasdaq composite above its 50-day moving average, with the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index closing in on that key level. BP (BP), Abiomed (ABMD) are also top stocks breaking out along with Apple, while  Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are near buy points.The 50-day moving average is traditionally an important support level for the S&P 500 and other major averages — as well as individual stocks — but in recent months it's been a resistance area. Friday was only the fourth day since March 21 that the Nasdaq composite has closed above the 50-day line. The Dow Jones has only been above its 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 2.So the stock market rally is at a key juncture. Is this another short-lived Nasdaq foray above its 50-day line, or will the Dow Jones and S&P 500 join it in a sustained advance? Apple and BP are among many top stocks clearing buy zones in recent days. Many more top stocks are on the cusp, such as Nvidia, Microsoft and Red Hat. But if they are going to be real winners, the broader stock market move higher.Dow Jones futures today climbed 0.4% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index futures advanced 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose almost 0.7%. U.S. crude futures topped $70 a barrel for the first time since November 2014.Remember that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action often doesn't translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

51,RHT,"Dow Jones futures were little changed early Tuesday, along with S&P 500 futures, while Nasdaq futures rallied. On Monday, the major stock market averages sold off on reports that President Donald Trump would curb China's access to U.S. technology. While the key indexes were hit, the biggest damage has come in leading stocks. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA), ServiceNow (NOW) and FleetCor (FLT) all tumbled below buy points on Monday.

55,RHT,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday.

Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter. Micron earned an adjusted $2.45 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up nearly eight times the 32 cents reported in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 71% to $6.8 billion. Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline.

FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%. The report come as FedEx and UPS (UPS) are in peak holiday delivery season, having beefed up staffing to meet delivery goals. UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million. It projects adjusted earnings of 81 cents, topping the consensus estimate of 75 cents. Full-year revenue guidance was raised by $21 million at the midpoint to $2.906 billion. But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views.

Concerns were raised, however, about the Stitch Fix's declining gross margin amid heavy capital expenditures. The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. The Dublin-based global tech consulting and services said it earned $1.79 a share, up 13%, with revenue rising 12% to  $9.5 billion.Biogen (BIIB) reported that a much-followed experimental Alzheimer's drug did not meet success criteria after 12 months in a Phase 2 trial. The study will continue to 18 months. Shares fell 3.3% on Thursday.Cintas (CTAS) saw earnings climb 14% to $1.31 in its fiscal second quarter. Revenue rose 24% to $1.61 billion. Both beat estimates.

60,RHT,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value.

The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant. If you haven't already, you should read the latest Big Picture column.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines. Square (SQ) has also been acting well. PayPal (PYPL) is close to record highs, but its recent breakout fizzled and its RS line has been going sideways since late 2017.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These 5 Stocks Have RS Lines At Highs, Including This IPO BreakoutDon't Discount These 4 Top Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesCybersecurity Leader Qualys Rebounds After Sell SignalHow Many Top Growth Stocks Are Forming Bases Now?IBD Stock Of The Day Nears New Buy Point After 46% Run In 2018

61,RHT,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 pointed to a strong open Monday morning on signs that a U.S.-China trade war may be averted as well as an amended trade pact with South Korea.

Chinese and U.S. officials, including Mnuchin, are in talks to widen U.S. access to China's market in manufacturing and financial services.Meanwhile, South Korea said it has reached an amended trade deal with the U.S. In exchange for doubling the import quotas on American-made cars to 50,000 a year, South Korea gets a permanent exemption from Trump's 25% steel tariffs.Facebook's fallout continues from the Cambridge Analytica furor, in which the U.K. firm that aided Donald Trump's presidential campaign had access to data from tens of millions of Facebook users. While Facebook said Cambridge should have never had access, the issue highlights concerns about users giving so much control over their personal to a massive platform seen as critical for communicating.A Reuters/Ipsos online poll released Sunday found that 41% of America trust Facebook to obey personal information privacy laws, vs. 66% for Amazon, 62% for Alphabet's Google, 60% for Microsoft (MSFT).Just 53% said they trust Apple, even though Apple has stressed data privacy and not selling user data to marketers.

If we can't, we don't deserve it,"" said the plain-text ad with a small Facebook logo.A question for investors is whether or not Facebook's woes have been priced into the stock, which had shown troubling signs well before last week's plunge.Will advertisers pull or slash spending on the social site for an extended period? Facebook and Google have been losing market share in online ads to Amazon, according to a new reportWill Facebook users reduce their time on site further, or begin to drop off? Will new laws or public pressure force changes in Facebook's data privacy that boost expenses or hurt revenue?Facebook shares rose a fraction early Monday.Red Hat will report fourth-quarter earnings after Monday's market close. The open source Linux software provider has been boosting growth from new products aimed at hybrid cloud computing.EPS will grow 33% to 81 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would be faster than Q3's 20% gain. Several other IBD 50 stocks are expected to show even-greater profit growth acceleration.Red Hat revenue is expected to rise 21% to $762 million. That would end a three-quarter string of gradually accelerating top-line growth, though it wouldn't take a big beat to surpass Q3's 22% sales gain.Red Hat fell 4.1% to 147.90 last week, but it's still near record highs, extended from a proper buy point.

But shares have drifted lower the last two days, dipping 0.6% to 85.83 on Tuesday.Intel has gone the other direction, leading the Dow industrials' gains for a third straight session, surging 8.7% over that stretch, including a 1.7% rise to 47.04 on Tuesday, just below a 47.40 buy point.Intel kicked off its recent run with a 3%, high-volume rebound from its 50-day moving average. That normally would be a clear buying opportunity, but the triple-witching impact meant that investors couldn't know how much true institutional conviction buying was happening. However, shares have kept sprinting higher in active trade.Micron Technology earnings surged 566% in the November quarter vs. a year earlier, easily beating views. Sales leapt 71%, also topping forecasts. And the memory chip giant gave bullish guidance.Micron rose 24 cents to 43.95 in the regular session, just above its 50-day line.

83,RHT,"Red Hat (RHT) stock has rebounded after disappointing current-quarter guidance sent shares in the Linux software provider down in late 2016, and a William Blair analysts says the company is gaining traction in cloud computing.Red Hat stock is up 13% in 2017, moving above it's 50-day moving average last month and approaching a technical buy point of 82.83 out of a 20-week consolidation.Shares of Red Hat traded in the 70s most of last year but plunged 14% on Dec. 22, to an 11-month low, after the enterprise software provider forecast current-quarter sales well below consensus estimates. Red Hat stock ended trading Monday up 0.7% to 79.77 on the stock market today.Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, says Red Hat should disclose more metrics related to its cloud business. Red Hat, along with Microsoft (MSFT) and VMware (VMW), aims to leverage its existing customer base as cloud computing gains momentum.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat has the second highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of the eight companies in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop group, which also includes Microsoft and Adobe Systems. The group ranks only No. 119 out of 197 industry groups. Adobe has a CR of 89 out of a possible 99, while Red Hat's CR is 79.""The reality check from our perspective is that Red Hat's strategic positioning appears firmly intact, midteens revenue growth looks sustainable, operating leverage is around the corner, and management seems aware of the need for greater disclosure on hot-button topics that could shift the narrative in the near term,"" Ader said in a research report Monday.Ader, who says he met recently with company management, maintains an outperform rating on Red Hat stock.Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).Analysts have been looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a Red Hat partner.Red Hat's cloud revenue mainly comes from customers using RHEL software on a ""pay as you go,"" or software-as-a-service, basis. It also aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.""Management believes that public cloud RHEL revenue and market share is significantly higher than meets the eye, as the cloud access piece of the business is larger than the transactional, on-demand piece,"" Ader said in the report. ""While management is unable to track and quantify the cloud access component, steady RHEL growth in the midteens supports the conclusion that the public cloud is currently more of a tailwind than a headwind to the business.""RELATED:Amazon Snags Snap Pact As Cloud Battle With Microsoft, Alphabet GrowsCould Google Bid For Salesforce.com Despite Amazon Cloud Pact?

84,RHT,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) is at a crossroads and should make ""needle-moving"" acquisitions either in data-center infrastructure, software or security, says a William Blair analyst.""We do not believe the old Cisco playbook of numerous tuck-in acquisitions combined with a few larger bets in emerging product areas will work,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a research report Monday. He maintained an outperform rating on Cisco stock, which inched down 2 cents to 31.30 on the stock market today, close to a buy point of 32.04.If Cisco ""doubles down"" on data-center infrastructure, Ader speculates, it could buy Nutanix (NTNX), Pure Storage (PSTG), Nimble Storage (NMBL) or NetApp (NTAP).If Cisco takes a ""hard pivot"" toward software, it could acquire Splunk (SPLK), Red Hat (RHT) or ServiceNow (NOW), Ader said.Cisco now garners about 5% of revenue from computer security products. It could make a big jump by purchasing Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) or Proofpoint (PFPT), Ader added.""Like its large-cap peers in IT infrastructure, we believe Cisco needs to embark on a fundamental business metamorphosis,"" Ader said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, Glaukos and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Cisco in January agreed to buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, just ahead of that company's planned IPO. AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.While Cisco has a partnership with Dell-EMC on networking products,  Ader says it could ""file for a full divorce.""Ader says that Cisco's effort to build a cloud computing rival to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), hasn't clicked. ""Its much-hyped, $1 billion Intercloud cloud-federation project launched in 2015 is expected to be shuttered shortly — likely another casualty of AWS,"" wrote Ader.The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, which could provide Cisco with more ammunition to make acquisitions, says the William Blair analyst.""We believe the company needs to place needle-moving M&A bets with a clear strategic objective, instead of its current (incremental) approach,"" he wrote.RELATED:How Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPE

85,RHT,"Red Hat's (RHT) fiscal Q3 revenue miss and disappointing current-quarter guidance sent shares in the Linux software provider down hard in premarket trading Thursday.BMO Capital Markets and Stifel downgraded Red Hat, while Jefferies, Pacific Crest Securities, Baird, Needham and Citigroup lowered their price points on Red Hat stock.Red Hat stock plummeted 14% to a 10-month low in the stock market today, closing at 68.70 and crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Shares had been forming a flat base, with a buy point of 82.83.""Weak fiscal Q3 results were attributed to slipped U.S. government deals, lower upfront payments for large multiyear deals and a more back-end-loaded period,"" said John DiFucci, a Jefferies analyst, in his research report. ""The reasoning was somewhat difficult to follow and does little to explain the weak fiscal Q4 guidance, other than assuming another more back-end-loaded quarter than usual.""IBD'S TAKE: There's a dearth of computer software stocks in the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks. But chipmaker Nvidia leads the IBD 50. Check out what other semiconductor, optical and wireless companies make the current ranking of top-performing stocks.Red Hat late Wednesday said earnings per share minus items rose 27% to 61 cents from the year-earlier quarter, topping Wall Street consensus estimates of 58 cents. Revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 17% to $615 million, missing consensus estimates of $621.7 million.For the current quarter, Red Hat forecast EPS of 61 cents, in-line with views. Red Hat said it expects revenue of $618 million at the midpoint of its guidance — well below consensus estimates of $637.7 million, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Still, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained his a buy rating.""We'd buy the stock on weakness as billings should accelerate into Q4,"" he wrote in a report. ""Further, we continue to expect margin improvement in fiscal 2018.""Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).The company also said that CFO Frank Calderoni would be stepping down in late January to enable him to accept a CEO position at another company. The company will appoint Eric Shander acting CFO. He's vice president of finance and accounting and principal accounting officer.Analysts were lowering their outlooks to account for Red Hat's disappointing guidance.""We are lowering our fiscal 2018 billings growth estimate from 13.2% to 10.5%, and lowering our FCF (free cash flow) estimate from $842 million to $784 million,"" said Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a report. ""Given changes to our top-line and FCF estimates, we are lowering our target price from 89 to 75.""Even with improved billings growth in Q4 from the closing of delayed deals, we believe that questions on billings growth in 2018 will keep the stock range-bound.""Needham analyst Scott Zeller lowered his price target on Red Hat stock to 89 from 98. He cited the disappointing billings due to customers hesitating to pay upfront for multiyear deals and ""slipped"" federal deals. ""We believe cash-conservation behavior is driven by macro uncertainty at the moment,"" he wrote in his report.But large-size sales were positive, analysts pointed out.Jason Ader, analyst at William Blair, said in a report: ""On the bright side, large deal momentum remained strong, with 73 deals greater than $1 million, up 20% year over year,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in his research note. ""We believe this reflects the increasing strategic importance that customers are assigning to Red Hat and the expansion of the product portfolio.""RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoMicrosoft Stock Gets Price-Target Hike As Cloud Bets Pay OffRed Hat Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Q3 Guidance Top Views, Stock Rises

Portfolio newcomer Teradyne has IBD's next-to-highest-possible Composite Rating of 98. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The maker of automated test equipment for the chip industry also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.The chip-testing systems firm serves the automobile, computing and game markets.In addition, Teradyne is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In July, the company's second-quarter report showed earnings per share up 64%. The 31% jump in revenue was the biggest jump in at least 19 quarters. Teradyne said results in the first half of the year were driven by strength in mobility, automotive, analog, microcontroller and memory end markets.Bright Horizons (BFAM) is another top new buy. Earnings per share growth has accelerated, having climbed 14%, 19%, 20% and 21% the past four quarters. The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said. Price increases averaged 3% to 4%. In addition, sales of backup dependent care and educational advisory services expanded.Fortive (FTV), a newcomer to the portfolio, makes equipment for testing and measurement, many for field instruments. EPS rose 13% and 11% the past two quarters, up from 1% the prior stanza.A spinoff from Danaher (DHR), Fortive was held by 1,388 mutual funds as of June 30. That was up from 1,305 funds as of Sept. 30, 2016. Funds' collective stakes rose to 148.3 million shares, up from 135.1 million shares.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

97,RHT,"A pickup in takeover activity in 2017 could revive computer security software stocks, says UBS, which says potential buyers include Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), as well as cloud-computing companies, telecom firms and defense contractors.""Cybersecurity has a hangover; consolidation is the needed cure,"" said UBS in a research report Monday.Besides the many publicly traded companies, UBS says the cybersecurity market has become overcrowded owing to the heavy venture-capital funding of startups.""While the obvious names in the space are Check Point, Cisco, Fortinet and Palo Alto, who combined have net cash of about $45 billion, we aren't ruling out nontraditional suitors like defense contractors, industrial firms, and telcos who've made a foray in the space in the recent past,"" said the UBS report.""With cloud security concerns only poised to intensify, we expect infrastructure vendors like Red Hat (RHT), VMware (VMW) and even Microsoft (MSFT) to also make greater inroads into security,"" UBS said.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix and Broadcom — and nontechs such as Goldman Sachs, Freeport-McMoRan, Burlington Stores and Martin Marietta — are among stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. See which 11 companies are in the current Leaderboard class of top stocks at or near breakouts. Cisco's security revenue in its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 29 rose 11% from the year-earlier quarter to about $540 million. Cisco acquired security software maker Sourcefire for $2.7 billion in 2013. More recent purchases include OpenDNS, Lancope and CloudLockIBD's 25-member Computer-Software Security group is ranked No. 165 out of 197 industry groups. The group rose in each of the first four trading days of 2017, after languishing in 2016, but slipped a small fraction in the stock market today. Check Point stock, down 4 cents Monday to 87.20, has formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point of 85.95, and so it remains in a buy zone. Palo Alto stock fell 1% Monday and is below both its 50-day and 200-day support lines.After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat-detection technologies. That uptick in crisis spending drove security software stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015.The shift of IT infrastructure to the cloud has many companies reassessing spending priorities, analysts say.""Cybersecurity as an investment theme became strained in 2016 owing to signs of reduced 'binge buying,' mixed fundamentals, investor anxiety about end demand health, and fears about irrelevance of conventional approaches in an increasingly cloud-computing-led IT world,"" said the UBS report. ""Extended sales cycles were another sore area for many vendors, which is not entirely surprising given the myriad vendors that have flooded the landscape in the last three years.""RELATED: Cisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity ShiftWill Cyberinsurance Replace Security?

Analysts are looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a Red Hat partner.Red Hat took part in the late-November AWS re: Invent developers conference, noted Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a research report.""Post-AWS re: Invent, we come away believing that Red Hat's role in the public cloud is secure medium term, and we expect management will continue to bring evidence that large cloud adopters are purchasing more on-premises,"" Pritchard wrote.The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.Red Hat's cloud revenue mainly comes from customers using RHEL software on a ""pay as you go,"" or software-as-a-service, basis.RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoMicrosoft Stock Gets Price-Target Hike As Cloud Bets Pay OffRed Hat Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Q3 Guidance Top Views, Stock Rises

The GDP Price Index was up 1.4%, unchanged from its prior third-quarter reading.The news on durable goods orders was mixed. New orders fell further than expected in November, down 4.6%.

101,RHT,"Adobe Systems' (ADBE) cloud-computing strategy has clicked, but the shift of enterprise computing workloads to cloud IT services poses a worry for cybersecurity software providers, says BMO Capital Markets, which initiated coverage of Adobe with an outperform rating.BMO analyst Keith Bachman also started coverage of software security firms Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Check Point Technologies (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE), but he gave them all with market perform ratings.IBD's 26-company Computer-Software Security group has had a rough 18 months — it fell 16% in 2016 — and now ranks just No. 178 out of 197 industry groups.Bachman initiated coverage of Adobe Systems with a price target of 125.  Adobe Systems, a member of the 158-ranged Computer Software-Desktop group, is the leading provider of software for content creators and creative professionals.

Facebook shares initially tumbled but rose modestly for the week.Amazon fell 4.4% Wednesday, undercutting its 50-day line, on a report that President Trump wants to ""go after"" the e-commerce giant.

Fellow FANG Netflix (NFLX) found support at its 50-day line.Shares of Lululemon (LULU) soared 12% to record highs for the week.

The annual inflation rate edged up to 1.6% from 1.5%, an 11-month high. Inflation is far below the Fed's 2% target, and there's enough doubt about corporate pricing power. So inflation will have to rise further to pressure Fed policymakers to hike rates more than three times this year. Commerce Department data on Thursday showed that disposable personal income rose 0.4% in February, but spending rose a modest 0.2%. That suggests people may initially be saving their tax cuts. Consumers ended 2017 on a strong note.

104,RHT,"Fidelity Investments' plan is that shareholders of Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) will find their usual satisfaction in the first five or so months of the year. In that span, Asher Anolic will temporarily take the helm from marquee manager Jason Weiner, who will spend that period away from the fund on a leave of absence, traveling with his family and pursuing educational opportunities.X Anolic will be the acting manager not only of the $1.7 billion Growth Discovery but also of its advisor-sold twin, $3.1 billion Advisor Equity Growth (FAEGX).For Anolic, the challenge is weighty. Weiner, who has steered the funds since February 2007 and early November of 2006 respectively, has led them to rarefied success.The funds outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 in the latest calendar year, 2017, as well as the three and five years ended Dec. 31. If the funds keep up that pace and add outperformance over the past 10 years, they will earn inclusion as IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. Only 4% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that feat by the end of 2016.Weiner — with Anolic as co-manager since July 1 — achieved that multiperiod outperformance with portfolios featuring leading stocks like Five Below (FIVE), Red Hat (RHT) and Alibaba Group (BABA), as well as household names like Facebook (FB)  and Amazon.com (AMZN), two of the FANG stocks.Shortly before 48-year-old Weiner began his sabbatical, he and 39-year-old Anolic talked with IBD from their Boston offices about their managerial juggling act and how their investment styles overlap and how they differ.IBD: Jason, has your management style changed since Asher joined you as co-manager?Weiner: Absolutely, yes. Any time you take on a partner, you talk about what you think, what your partner thinks. Ash came with experience in health care and staples, and with a much sharper quantitative investment focus. No two people have the same skill set. So one plus one equals more than two.IBD: Asher, have you changed?Anolic: With my background in staples and health care and financials, I never had a chance to encounter some of the big open-ended growth stories that Jason has done an excellent job figuring out. Those companies can have huge addressable markets, which become multiples of what people think they are today.In the past, I would have shied away from those because I was afraid of getting caught in something that I wasn't able to visualize where it could go. Jason's been great helping me out there.IBD: Since before the 2016 elections, the fund has swung toward cyclical stocks, then growth stocks, then back to cyclicals. How has that worked for the fund?Weiner: In 2016 growth didn't perform well and we didn't get paid for owning them. We got it all back in 2017 for the first three-quarters of the year. In the last quarter those leadership names took a breather. But I think it's healthy because we don't want a bubble.We stuck with growth. Now our job is to look forward into 2018 and figure out how to extend the process. No matter what the short-term gyrations are, how do we stick with names that are growing earnings and adding value?IBD: What's been the biggest change in the market during your career, Jason?Weiner: When I started at Fidelity in 1991, I was a junior analyst picking small-cap names. There was an inherent advantage because small companies were where you found little trees that grew into big trees.Today, it's completely the opposite. The only companies growing fast are the biggest companies in the world, companies with market caps of $500 billion. That's really driven by internet economics. This is very different, very unique.IBD: And you still look for the best growth opportunities, with an overlay of valuation sensitivity?Weiner: That hasn't changed. We look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with the potential for price-to-earnings (P/E) expansion, while avoiding names that have unreasonably high valuations or deteriorating business fundamentals.IBD: Asher, what changes will you make while Jason is out?Anolic: Aside from the fact that I don't love the decor (which drew laughter from both Anolic and Weiner), I expect changes in less than a quarter of the holdings. Jason has constructed the portfolio with a two-year horizon. We've tested lots of what-if scenarios. Nothing should surprise us. If something does crop up out of left field, I will adjust. But the fundamental approach will not change.IBD: Does Facebook still meet your valuation check box?Weiner: It's valuation is a lot higher than a year ago. It occurred because they grew fast. Earnings went up. They're touching 1 billion people a day with News Feed, their main product. You can sell a lot of advertising when you touch over 1 billion people a day.I still think they will improve their ad targeting. So fundamentals are intact. Can I find better value elsewhere (in another stock)? That search goes on every day. After the big move in these (internet) names in the last year, that conversation is a little more intense.IBD: With Amazon, you're comfortable that their spending will pay off within a reasonable period?Weiner: If you say retail as we knew it is dead and the retail of tomorrow is being invented as we speak, which companies are at the forefront? It is Alibaba and Amazon.We like to take a company's profit-and-loss statement and break down the business units. For Amazon, it's domestic retail and international retail and Amazon Web Services. How is each performing? What are their opportunities? With the investments they make, what will future earnings be like?IBD: Asher, what would you add?Anolic: AWS is cost intensive, more than the rest of Amazon. But it has taken a ton of market share, and has good margins and good cash flow. It's at the forefront of a major technological shift.IBD: Any more thoughts about Alibaba?Weiner: I look at Amazon and Alibaba as a pair. You want to distill the thoughts of Alibaba's Jack Ma (founder and executive chairman) and Amazon's Jeffrey Bezos (founder, chairman and CEO)? Looking at them together is helpful to understanding what those visionaries are doing. Just one part of that is inventing a new world of retail.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news and analysis of Chinese stocks, visit IBD's special section about Chinese stocks to buy and watch.IBD: Does Five Below defy the problems of many brick-and-mortar retailers by discounting and by focusing on a teen audience?Weiner: It's too small to worry about, but I will tell you this: It's like Dollar Tree (DLTR) plus a treasure-hunt thing. Mom can bring her kids, who go to the $5 basketballs while mom goes to the $5 makeup aisle. I remember the CEO saying once, ""This is the only store where you can bring your kids and not have any fears.""IBD: Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers. Is that like being the top buggy-whip maker?Anolic: With the move to the cloud, people are worried about Red Hat's growth prospects. If you have a Linux operating system for several servers, but then you move a lot of that data to AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft (Azure), you don't need all of those servers or that operating system.But Red Hat's core Linux business is still fantastic. Much in the cloud runs on Linux. And Red Hat is reinventing its business. They have a new product that can write programs on top of the Red Hat system and port them to different clouds. It gives CIOs the flexibility of not getting locked in to one cloud vendor. This gives some visibility to how Red Hat looks in a cloud environment. We're going to keep monitoring it. It's a fascinating solution.IBD: What business hasn't been totally disrupted, but could be eventually?Weiner: Digital payments. Payments in general have entrenched players like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and card-issuing banks like Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) and merchant acquirers like First Data (FDC) and Global Payments (GPN). That system has been built over decades.But PayPal has given us a taste of disruption. We've all used PayPal at checkout. Can they take that beachhead and expand into the payment space? They've already got Venmo in people-to-people payments. And they own Braintree, which (provides mobile and web payments acceptance and processing for) merchants. (The payments space) feels ripe for disruption.IBD: Why do you like Copart (CPRT)?Weiner: It's a duopoly (with KAR Auction Services (KAR)), a great business. Hurricane Irma rolls through (the Caribbean and) Florida, Harvey hits Houston, and 100,000 cars get wrecked. They get disposed of through auto auctions. Copart is family run, has super profitability and super acquisitions. When cars get totaled, sometimes the scrap value is higher than a resale value.IBD: Asher, you're continuing to run $784 million Select Pharmaceuticals (FPHAX). What's the biggest change in joining Jason at the helm of Growth Discovery?Anolic: Jason has been helpful in teaching and generous with his time. So I'm totally up to speed on what is needed. And we worked together before I was named co-manager, so I was familiar with how he runs money.The biggest change is moving from one sector to the whole market. Six months of partnering doesn't teach you everything that someone running for 20-plus years has learned. But the skill set I've built allows me to understand day-to-day market moves and how to learn as I go.IBD: Jason, was Asher's apprenticeship long enough?Weiner: Asher is an experienced investor. And the way the fund (Growth Discovery) is built, 70% of its assets are in the top 40 names, so Asher only has to learn about 40 names to understand nearly three-quarters of the portfolio. Also, Asher already knew some names from his work on other mutual funds. And we have a huge amount of research support.IBD: Jason, will you be able to hit the ground running when you return in May or so?Weiner: I think I'll be raring to go. I'll have had a nice break, but it will be nice to get back to business.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltHot Fidelity Fund Owns Stocks Like Tencent That Jumped Friday

105,RHT,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rallied Wednesday morning following President Trump's State of the Union address and heading into a slew of big earnings reports before and after the session.The major averages suffered their worst losses of 2018 on Tuesday. But Workday (WDAY), Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Salesforce.com (CRM) rose modestly Tuesday or fell less than the S&P 500's 1.1% retreat. Red Hat (RHT) matched the S&P 500's decline.X Even better, Workday, Salesforce.com and Red Hat are all in buy range. Electronic Arts and fellow video game maker Take-Two Interactive closed Tuesday slightly below entry points, but rallied in extended trading on EA's earnings report and guidance.S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures rose about 0.4% vs. fair value, even with tech titan Apple (AAPL) down modestly. Apple has lagged the major averages for months, with its earnings due Thursday night.In his primetime State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump touted recently passed tax cuts and the big rally in the stock market over the past year. He also called for immigration reform and $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending.Meanwhile, investors will digest earnings from many top companies today, including Boeing (BA) before the open as well as Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close.Workday rose 3.2% to 120.26 in Tuesday's stock market trading after Morgan Stanley upgraded the cloud-based business software firm and William Blair said it recently won two big financial-software deals. That move pushed Workday to the edge of a buying range from a 111.98 cup-with-handle entry point. But it was the first time Workday's breakout seemed impressive.The initial Jan. 23 breakout came on volume that was well below average, and it remained light for the next several sessions. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was lagging. Even as the stock moved into all-time highs, the RS line remained stuck below even short-term peaks.But on Tuesday, trading volume was 51% above normal. And with Workday posting a big gain on a bad market day, its RS line rose to a two-month high.Salesforce fell 0.9% to 112.23, a modest loss on below-average volume. The maker of on-demand customer relationship software is comfortably above a 109.29 flat-base buy point. Salesforce initially cleared the entry point on Jan. 12, but volume was only 25% above normal. That's OK, but you'd really like to see a 40%-50% minimum gain as a sign that institutional buyers are stepping in. The next session, the stock fell back below the entry on similar volume. Salesforce then retook the entry, but on a series of low-volume moves.Also, Salesforce's RS line really hasn't made any progress from short-term levels since the breakout.Red Hat broke out past a 131.03 flat-base entry on Jan. 25, then rose to near the top of the 5% buy zone the next session. Shares have pulled back the last two sessions, including Tuesday's 1.1% on volume that was 34% below normal.The Linux software firm's breakout came on volume that was just above average. The RS line has not made much improvement since then.Electronic Arts closed up 0.9% to 118.70, working toward a 112.89 buy point. After the close, the video game maker met fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates and fell short on revenue. But EA guided higher for the current March quarter.EA shot up 7.8% to 127.95 in premarket trading Wednesday, suggesting a breakout into a buy zone.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open and close the following session.Also, EA's RS line is well below where it was at the start of the five-month consolidation, though it did top a very short-term high this week. Hopefully, EA's after-hours action does carry over to Wednesday with a high-volume price spike.Take-Two fell 0.8% to 118.31 on Tuesday. The stock has topped a 120.28 buy point from a handle in the last two sessions, but failed to close above it. Take-Two rallied early Wednesday in sympathy with peer EA, climbing 1.5% to 120.05, just below the entry.Take-Two's RS line has some distance to the consolidation's highs, but a solid breakout would give it at least a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Suffer 2nd Distribution Day; Leaders Hit AgainAlibaba Likely To Show Strongest Revenue Growth In 15 QuartersAbiomed, Arista, Align, YY: How To Read A Stock Rebound3 Fast-Growing Sector Leaders Telling Different Stories Ahead Of EarningsWhat Apple's Stock Chart Is Telling Us Going Into Earnings, iPhone X OutlookAs Market Sold Off, This Small-Cap Tech Stock Rocketed Up; Why?

106,RHT,"Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund (CLSPX) is revving up its engine. In recent periods, the $1.9 billion portfolio has been neck-and-neck with or a tad ahead of the broad market and its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct. So far this young year, going into Thursday, the fund is up 5.08% vs. 4.89% for the S&P 500 and 4.64% for its peer group. That's an improvement over the past three years, when it slightly lagged the S&P 500.X Credit starts with leading stocks held by the fund. Top holdings FleetCor Technologies (FLT) and Red Hat (RHT) rose 36% and 74% in the past 12 months. Top new buy Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Arista Networks (ANET) rose 42% and 198%.Other holdings include Thor Industries (THO) and Align Technologies (ALGN), which are up 48% and 186% in the past 12 months. Like Arista and FleetCor, they happen to be members of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Eight of the fund's 10 largest positions as of Dec. 31 had IBD Composite Ratings in the 80s or 90s. So did seven of its 10 top new buys. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.Managers George Myers, Brian Neigut and William Chamberlain invest in companies poised for sustainable long-term growth and which have high or improving margins and returns on invested capital.And the managers consider midcaps the sweet spot of the market. With market capitalizations between $2 billion and $30 billion when the fund buys them, midcap stocks are ""big enough to offer stability yet small enough to deliver significant growth opportunities,"" the managers explain in their Dec. 31 fact sheet.Commercial fleet payment processor FleetCor was the fund's top holding as of Dec. 31. Its weighting rose to 2.65% from 1.72% at the end of September. Trading around 204, share price is extended from its November breakout from a 171.88 buy point of a long base.Late last year the company boosted its share buyback program and said that Wal-Mart (WMT) would begin to accept its payment cards at fueling stations.Red Hat earnings per share grew 12%, 40% and 20% the past three quarters. Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers.As IBD has reported, analysts have been looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon and a Red Hat partner.Dollar Tree re-entered the portfolio in October. EPS grew 10%, 37% and 40% the past three quarters. In December, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and sales. It also raised its full-year earnings and sales forecasts.The managers began their current stake in Arista in November. EPS grew 30%, 37%, 81% and 95% the past four quarters. The cloud-networking software maker is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, which in turn is ranked second among IBD's 197 industry groups.Arista has been taking share from Cisco in the data center-switching market. ""We think Arista's long-term software development will continue to drive share gains as already demonstrated by the current 100 gigabit cycle and recent switch-router traction,"" Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette recently told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Arista's strengths — like its 49% three-year EPS growth rate — stack up against its peers' at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Recreational vehicle maker conglomerate Thor Industries gapped up 13% on Nov. 28 as it was about to report a 63% jump in quarterly earnings after the close. That 63% hike capped increases of 27%, 40% and 44% the prior three stanzas.Invisible braces maker Align is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth. Its EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 18%, 37% and 60% in the three most recent frames. Sales growth has also accelerated in that period.Trading around 272 and forming a new base, shares are just 2% above their 266.51 cup-shaped base buy point.The stock is ranked No. 1 in its IBD Medical-Products industry group.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

108,RHT,"In a good year for technology stocks, IBD's software sector has climbed nearly 30%. IShares North America Tech-Software (IGV) ETF has been a vehicle for that trade.The exchange traded fund is up about 38% in 2017 and trading near all-time highs. Its performance has earned the fund a spot on IBD's ETF Leaders screen, and it's the only pure-software ETF on this month's list.As happens with other leading ETFs, the success of many of its top components have carried the fund to a market-beating performance. In the case of iShares North America Tech-Software, solid advances for Microsoft (MSFT), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Intuit (INTU), Red Hat (RHT) and several others have combined into an attractive basket of software stocks.Microsoft — the largest holding, with a nearly 9% weighting — is near an all-time high as it stretches a fine advance of 33% that began a year ago. That's when the stock broke out of a base on a bullish earnings report.Activision climbed as much as 46% from a breakout on earnings Feb. 10. Red Hat is up about 50% from a February breakout. ServiceNow (NOW) has risen roughly 30% from breakouts in January and April.IShares North America Tech-Software includes companies in video game, medical, database, security, financial and other software segments. According to the iShares website, the ETF is about half invested in what it calls application software, about one-third in systems software and 14% in home entertainment.After its powerful run, is the ETF at risk of exhausting itself?The software industry is largely cyclical. Continued expansion of the U.S. economy, improving corporate profits and capital spending, plus low unemployment make for a good foundation for growth.But the software sector certainly follows pullbacks and corrections in the general market, and growth stocks tend to fall more than the main indexes during weak markets.A positive trend is that few of the 57 stocks in iShares North America Tech-Software are in risky late-stage bases, overstretched in their price runs or under stress.That also means there are quite a few stocks that have traded horizontally for many months and haven't participated in the software rally. But those are concentrated among the ETF's smaller holdings (Open Text (OTEX), Splunk (SPLK) and CA Inc. (CA), to name a few).Indeed, the top-weighted holdings are where most of the best stock gains are found.The ETF itself climbed past a 145.80 buy point in late August and remains in buy range. Shares pulled back to the 50-day moving average a few weeks back and found support at that level, a sign the ETF can continue to advance.RELATED:Technology ETF Rolling, But Will Q3 Earnings Halt The Party?Amazon, Microsoft Join To Offer Artificial Intelligence Platform

Adobe, like Microsoft (MSFT), has migrated to a web-based SaaS subscription business models from one-time licensing fees or packaged software. SaaS companies tend to have low customer turnover, high renewal rates and book recurring revenue over the long term. Customers receive automatic software updates through secure network connections.RBC Capital's top software picks also include Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) among large caps.

130,RHT,"Heat continues to mount on credit reporting agency Equifax (EFX), which last week disclosed a massive breach in which hackers stole the personal identification information of as many as 143 million consumers.XOn Thursday, an open-source software organization said that it had publicly posted a patch for the vulnerability that hackers used to access Equifax data about two months before the hack, but that apparently Equifax did not install the patch before the breach took place, if it ever did.Separately on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating the data breach. In addition, several congressional bills were filed that would hold Equifax and other data brokers accountable for such errors. And on Friday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and other senators will introduce a bill to require credit bureaus to let consumers freeze their credit for free, according to Reuters news service. Some credit agencies charge around $5.A credit freeze blocks criminals from setting up bogus accounts whose purchases get charged to victims.The open-source software organization, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), told IBD that it posted a patch for the vulnerability known as CVE-2017-5638 in the Apache Struts program on March 7.Equifax identified that as the vulnerability that hackers used. But the hack did not take place until mid-May through July, Equifax has said. Equifax realized it had been breached on July 29. Equifax disclosed the breach on Sept. 7.ASF suggested that an organization such as Equifax is presumed to be aware of such postings, but ASF does not know what if anything Equifax did know about the patch. It said that Equifax is not a customer of ASF and that ASF has no one-on-one relationship with Equifax.ASF spokeswoman Sally Khudairi told IBD by email: ""The Apache Software Foundation provides Open Source software that is freely available to all at no cost or restriction on its use. Those who wish to use our software projects simply download the projects from apache.org and/or one of many globally-distributed mirror sites.""Khudairi added: ""Any risks, along with patches, are announced and widely shared with Apache project communities. In addition, security vulnerabilities or exploits are disseminated on sites such as NIST (U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as dozens (if not hundreds) of software providers and security specialists (such as MITRE and Symantec).""Further, Khudairi said, ""As with all Apache software, patches are made available to the public at large. Financial services organizations are often known for being highly aware of security vulnerabilities in general, and are therefore particularly vigilant with their processes for patching any known exploits.""Equifax has not yet responded to IBD questions concerning the patch.ASF oversees more than 350 leading open source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — which it calls the world's most popular web-server software. ASF is a not-for-profit charitable organization, whose sponsors include high-profile corporations such as Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT), Target (TGT) and Yahoo.Any entity can use ASF's software, even if they are not a sponsor. Equifax is not a sponsor.No one using the ""@equifax"" domain has communicated via email with ASF for almost two years, Khudairi says. ASF can't tell if an Equifax person communicated with ASF using a personal email address.On Sept. 8, the day after disclosing the breach, Equifax stock gapped down 14%. In the stock market today, its shares were trading near 91.40, down 37% from its 52-week high reached July 26.Shares in Symantec (SYMC), which owns credit monitoring service LifeLock, broke out above a 33.32 buy point in an irregular base Tuesday. It dipped below the buy point the next two days but rose back above it Friday. The stock ranks fourth in IBD's computer software security group, according to IBD's Stock Checkup. The industry group's ranking has risen to 60 from 177 three weeks ago.

Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. AWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware (VMW), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers.Rather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard, which now includes Freeport-McMo-Ran, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. ""The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,"" wrote Pritchard.

Red Hat stock hit a 2016 high above 82 early Thursday and was up 3.9%to 80.02 in the stock market today.""Strength in the quarter was broad-based but due in part to record Q2 large deal flow as Red Hat continues to become a more strategic enterprise partner,"" said Matthew Hedberg, an RBC Capital analyst, in a research report. In the quarter ended Aug. 31, Red Hat said it signed a record 55 deals valued at $1 million or more, up 60% from the year-earlier quarter, as well as five deals over $5 million vs. three.Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. It's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage. Red Hat has been investing in emerging technologies such as OpenStack, a cloud software standard.""The company specifically called out strong traction in OpenShift and three OpenStack deals over $1 million,"" wrote Pac Crest analyst Ben McFadden in a report. ""In addition, infrastructure-related subscriptions were particularly strong, re-accelerating to 18% year-over-year growth, which should more than alleviate concerns about a slowdown in core RHEL.McFadden hiked his price target to 90 from 88, while UBS increased its PT to 90 from 85 and Jefferies bumped its PT to 79 from 75.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat, VMware and many other companies with a stake in corporate data center spending are adapting to the rise of Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com. AWS is the leader in outsourced cloud computing services. Amazon, boosted by AWS' growth, is an IBD Leaderboard stock.""The story in the August quarter was a re-acceleration in core infrastructure-related revenue, mainly RHEL,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Red Hat said fiscal Q2 EPS minus items rose 17% to 55 cents, while revenue climbed 19% to $600 million.

The leader in open-source operating system software reports earnings after the market close on Wednesday.RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg says that while Red Hat has been boosted by ties to AWS, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), a partnership with Microsoft could provide more upside. Microsoft has emerged as a strong No. 2 behind Amazon in infrastructure-as-a-service, in which client companies rent computers and data storage via the internet cloud.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard, meanwhile, says investors should be more focused on Red Hat's open-source software share gains.""We continue to believe public cloud positioning for Red Hat is too hotly debated, as RHT has multiple ways to monetize as customers move to cloud architecture,"" Pritchard said in a research report.Red Hat reported fiscal Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations, with EPS ex items up 21% from the year-earlier period and sales up 17%. But the company's EPS outlook for the May quarter merely met views.""We don't think cloud growth is large enough to push estimates higher,"" said BMO Capital Markets in a report.In a seasonally slow quarter, analysts expect fewer large sales contracts for the company, the No. 1 provider of Linux. Recent acquisitions might impact adjusted operating margins, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a research report.""Further investments in growth areas should be expected, although meaningful margin improvement is possible longer-term,"" Lenschow wrote.Red Hat stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 76.30 buy point on April 20, so it's within range after closing Monday at 78.88, up 2%.Red Hat shares ended trading Tuesday up 1.9% to 80.39.

The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today.

152,RHT,"The software sector continues to be a nice pocket of leadership in the market.Sector Leaders NetEase (NTES) and Paycom Software (PAYC) are high-quality names, but several other top-rated names with good qualities are also worth a look.After three straight low-volume declines, Ellie Mae (ELLI) showed good action Thursday afternoon, reversing higher for a 0.5% gain. It's near a 102.73 flat-base buy point. The company provides on-demand software solutions and services for the residential mortgage industry. On demand is synonymous with software as a service (SaaS), where software is licensed on a subscription basis and centrally hosted. Growth prospects still look good at the fast-growing firm, with full-year earnings expected to rise 21% this year and 28% in 2017.ServiceNow (NOW) is a big, liquid enterprise software name with a market capitalization of nearly $13 billion , but it tends to trade in a choppy fashion.  The company develops cloud-based IT software for workflow automation, data consolidation and business process administration. Similar to Ellie Mae, recent quarterly results show consistently strong demand for the company's software.The 80 price level has been a ceiling so far for ServiceNow as it trades near a 78.87 buy point. Two highly regarded growth funds own shares of ServiceNow: Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (LEGAX) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund (PRNHX).Finally, on the heels of a nice earnings report last month, shares of Red Hat (RHT) have pulled back gently after a bullish gap up in price Sept. 22. On that day, Red Hat rose nearly 4% but closed near its low for the session after briefly clearing an 81.91 buy point. The stock also tends to trade in a volatile fashion.Long known as a provider of open-source software, Red Hat has evolved into a cloud infrastructure company.Its latest quarter was particularly impressive because sales growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, rising 19% to $599.8 million. Subscriptions made up the bulk of sales, rising 20% to $531 million. Earnings also topped expectations, and the company guided results for the current quarter slightly above expectations.

153,RHT,"Microsoft (MSFT,) Google, IBM (IBM) and other cloud-computing rivals of Amazon Web Services are bracing for an AWS ""partnership"" announcement with VMware expected to be announced Thursday.The big questions are how far-reaching the alliance between AWS, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and VMware will be, and when products will be ready. Fortune first reported that VMware, now controlled by Dell EMC, would announce a deal with AWS.VMware forged a cloud alliance with IBM in February. AWS, though, is by far the leader in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), with Microsoft No. 2 and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google No. 3.Deutsche Bank says Google's cloud computing unit could be a bright spot when Alphabet reports earnings on Oct. 27.IBD'S TAKE: VMware stock has been in a flat trading range since the Dell-EMC merger in September. AWS has been a big growth driver for parent Amazon. If Google's cloud business takes off in similar fashion, parent Alphabet would have another growth engine. For now, Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock, while Alphabet is not.Diane Greene, a co-founder of VMware, now heads Google's cloud business. VMware's virtualization software, which lets servers share computing workloads, is widely used in corporate data centers.VMware is competing with Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT) and other rivals to be a key part of next-generation data centers as companies shift business workloads to hybrid, private-public cloud infrastructure. In the IaaS market, companies access remote computing resources — servers and data storage — via the web.One goal of the AWS-VMware partnership will be making it easier for customers to run VMware software on Amazon's public cloud infrastructure.While VMware apparently is mending fences with archrival AWS, it's also warming up to Cisco Systems (CSCO), says a recent Morgan Stanley report. ""The once combative posture between Cisco and VMware in the SDN (software defined networking) space has given rise to greater collaboration in recent months,"" said the report.VMware stock fell 0.3% to 73.21 in the stock market today, near 73. VMware stock has been forming a flat base, with a possibly buy point of 77.09. Amazon stock rose 0.4% to 834.09 and trading near record highs touched this month.RELATED:Google Can Out-Innovate Amazon.com In Cloud, Says CitiRed Hat Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Q3 Guidance Top Views, Stock RisesVMware's VMworld Called Snooze; Will New Parent Dell Inject Life?

Shares rose 1.7% in Wednesday's regular session, to 77.04, but are still down about 7% in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat, VMware and many other companies with a stake in corporate data center spending are adapting to the rise of Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com. AWS is the leader in outsourced cloud computing services. Amazon, boosted by AWS' growth, is an IBD Leaderboard stock.Raleigh, N.C.-based Red Hat is battling rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and VMware (VMW) as customers shift to hybrid, private-public cloud infrastructure. In cloud computing, customers lease computing resources via the web. Red Hat had about $100 million in public cloud revenue in fiscal 2016, analysts say, mainly from customers using RHEL software on a ""pay as you go,"" or software-as-a-service basis.Red Hat has been investing in emerging technologies, such as cloud software standard OpenStack, and making acquisitions, pressuring profit margins.RELATED:Adobe Soars To New High On Strong Earnings, GuidanceVMware Aims To Be Cloud 'Switzerland,' With New Offerings For All Clouds

160,RHT,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region.

U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen.

Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance.

But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000.

It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot.

Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates.

Amgen, Regeneron, Biogen and Celgene are up more than 5% just this week, with Biogen and Regeneron up more than 10%.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is rated No. 1 in IBD's Biomed/Biotech group, with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. To find out which are the other top-rated biotechs, and how they stack up vs. objective critera, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Several other drug groups are big recent winners, among them the ethical drugs group, which includes Dow stock Merck (MRK). Merck rose 1.4% to 65.46 on Wednesday on a new approval for its immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda. Merck has a 66.90 conventional buy point with a 65.68 aggressive entry.Meanwhile, IBD's Software-Desktop group, home to Oracle, is the fourth-best industry over the past five days. The Dow's Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Red Hat (RHT) are also members. (Other software groups, including enterprise software and medical software, also have had big gains.)Celgene leapt 5.2% to 132.83, blasting past a 127.74 buy point, holding just within the 5% chase zone. There's a growing feeling among investors that President Trump will not crack down on drug prices, despite various comments he has made before and after the campaign.Regeneron rose 5.4% to 522.02, further extended from a buy point and trading at its best levels since the beginning of 2016.Amgen advanced 3.1% as it builds the right side of a base.Biogen gained 4.7%, retaking its 200-day moving average a day after vaulting above its 50-day.Recent Biogen spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) edged down 0.1%, but is holding in a buy zone after Monday's breakout. Bioverativ is on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service highlighting a select cull of stocks, mostly growth plays in or near buy zones.Clovis Oncology (CLVS) has skyrocketed 57% this week after reporting strong trial data, suggesting its ovarian cancer drug may get a much-wider use.Gilead Sciences (GILD) rose 2.9% to above its 50-day line as the Hepatitis-C and HIV biotech tries to break a downtrend going back more than a year.One good way to play the biotech boom is via ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB). Both XBI and IBB broke out of consolidations this week.Oracle reported much-stronger-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, with 3% revenue growth also edging past views. Shares of the business software giant shot up 11% to 51.35 in premarket trading on the stock market today. That would be a record high and well above a 47.09 buy point, though overnight trading doesn't always carry over into the regular session. Still, Oracle already topped an aggressive entry of 46.17 on Wednesday, rising 1.1% to 46.33 in heavy volume.In addition to desktop software names Microsoft, Adobe and Red Hat, which are all near long-time or all-time highs, several other business software stocks have been breaking out and hitting highs in recent months. They include cloud-based payroll software players such as Workday (WDAY), Paylocity (PCTY) and Paycom (PAYC), as well as ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV).In Asian trading Thursday, Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.1% while China's Shanghai composite slid 0.3%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE retreated 0.4%, Germany's Dax was flat while France's Cac fell 0.3%.RELATED:The Big Picture: Biotechs Lift Nasdaq; Oil Bloodbath ContinuesBiotech Breakouts: Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ In Buy ZoneOracle Earnings Come In Ahead On Top And Bottom LinesBiotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesHow Dow's Merck Is Still Beating Bristol, Roche In Immuno-OncologyIs This Medical Cloud Computing Play Set To Rebound, Or Crash?

164,RHT,"XStocks trekked lower Tuesday but gave back only a piece of the ground gained on Monday.The Nasdaq took the hardest hit, falling 0.8%. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average drifted down 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in higher than Monday's levels.West Texas intermediate crude dropped to just above $43 a barrel as oil sloughed off another 2%, undercutting a May low to settle at its lowest point since November. But a move that would've sent oil-related stocks crowding the lowest slots on the Dow and S&P 500 barely even registered.   Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) dropped less than 1%.  Oil stocks posted only five of the day's 20 worst losses among S&P 500 stocks.General Electric (GE) was the Dow's worst performer, down 2% in weak trade.  Apple (AAPL) tumbled 0.8%, and all four of the FANG stocks ended lower, despite a price target increase for Netflix (NFLX).Medicals, drugmakers and biotechs posted a strong session. Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) easily topped the Dow industrials, up 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.  IBD 50 stock Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) led both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. (Biotechs and drugmakers took the day's top seven gains among Nasdaq 100 stocks.)Regeneron surged 5% to reach a 17-month high, despite Novartis (NVS) reporting its RTH258 macular degeneration drug had outperformed Regeneron's Eylea in a head-to-head clinical trial. Regeneron is up 9% since clearing a six-month cup base in May. Novartis shares rose 0.2% Tuesday.Alexion jumped 3% after regulatory filings showed CEO Ludwig Hanson made a purchase of company shares worth $1.1 billion.IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock Floor & Decor (FND) ended 2% higher after backing down from its early highs. The gain left shares in a buy range above a 43.20 buy point, settling 109% above their April IPO price.Retail was Tuesday's worst-performing industry, as Dillard's (DDS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) each dropped 5%.  Ross Stores (ROST) shed almost 5%, the worst decline among Nasdaq 100 stocks.Several big names are scheduled to roll out earnings reports after the close, with Adobe Systems (ADBE), FedEx (FDX) and Red Hat (RHT) topping the list.RELATED:These Biotechs Are Leading The Industry To A 3-Month HighAmazon Gets Ratings Upgrade After Whole Foods Buy: Is Grubhub Next?  
"
165,RHT,"X The Nasdaq composite on Wednesday deflected yet another pounding in crude oil futures and related companies in the stock market, moving moderately higher as the Dow Jones industrial average harbored light losses late in Wall Street's regular session.The Nasdaq composite, up 0.7% at around 3:45 p.m. New York time, is stretching its year-to-date lead over the S&P 500 (down fractionally Wednesday) and the Dow Jones industrials (down 0.2%) despite showing five distribution days over the past 25 sessions. Volume on Wednesday is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's Big Picture column tracks heavy institutional selling in the form of distribution days, as witnessed in the Nasdaq on Tuesday (down 0.8%, higher volume than on Monday); a sudden rash of big declines in heavier volume than the prior session is enough to kill a bull market.The Nasdaq is up nearly 16% since Jan. 1, towering over the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. The Dow Jones industrial average is also lagging after a 13.4% gain in 2016, up 8.3% so far this year.Buying in the biotech and software sectors continued unabated in the aftermath of solid quarterly results from the likes of Adobe Systems (ADBE) (extended after a breakout at 111.19 in January) and Red Hat (RHT) (also extended from an 81.24 early entry in a long, choppy first-stage base).In the biotech group, which jumped to No. 31 among IBD's 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all pumped more than 5% higher in heavy turnover, showing the kind of action seen by iPhone giant Apple (AAPL) during its big runs in the mid-2000s and early part of the 2010s.Celgene has a market value of $103 billion, Regeneron is at $55 billion, and Vertex at $33 billion, vs. $760 billion for the iPhone, iPad and MacBook maker.When a stock breaks out, it tends to already be close to 52-week or all-time highs, already be trading above the 50- and 200-day moving averages, show a tremendous increase in share volume, and show strong finishes during its up sessions in prices.That's definitely the case with the three biomedical names mentioned above. All three are highly profitable developers of novel therapies to address difficult diseases and chronic conditions.Celgene ran 5% higher to 132.38 and powered past a 127.74 cup-base buy point in volume that is currently triple usual levels. The stock's 50-day average volume is 3.7 million shares. That cup could be seen as part of a long saucer base that goes all the way back to its July 2015 peak of 140.72.Notice on a weekly chart how Celgene had broken out of a three-month saucer pattern at 129.16 in July 2015, but did a hairpin curve lower and undercut the low of that base. Such action was a healthy shakeout of uncommitted investors and reset the base count back to zero. The Street sees first-quarter profit at the Summit, N.J., firm rising 24% to $1.78 a share. Celgene has posted EPS increases of 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% in the prior six quarters.Celgene sports an outstanding 98 Composite Rating and a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if its 68 Relative Price Strength score improves in the near term.Regeneron (97 Composite Rating, 94 EPS Rating) is extended from a first-stage bottoming-base entry at 453.06 as shares have soared more than 13% so far this week to 521.71. However, notice on a weekly chart how the stock may run into some upside resistance in the 550 to 590 price level.Vertex (98 Composite, 79 EPS) surged 5% to 133.30 in fast turnover and is moving further past a recent handle on a long base, giving a solid entry at 122.06 (10 cents above the May 2 intraday high). In the handle, the stock sloped lower along the intraday lows and corrected no more than 7%.Back to Apple, the megacap tech is showing it still may have the wherewithal to recover from a sharp sell-off in the prior two weeks that triggered two key sell signals (read this Stock Market Today column to learn more about the exact sell rules).Apple gained around 0.6% to 145.59. Volume is light, but the stock is limiting its drop below the 50-day moving average to around 2%.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating remains strong for now at 85, much better than the lowly 59 seen at the start of the year. However, keep in mind that the RS Rating covers 12 months' worth of price action vs. the rest of the market. Extra weight is given to the most recent three months' worth of action.There are plenty of reasons for long-term holders with a thick profit cushion to keep holding: 1) Apple is still well above its long-term 200-day moving average; 2) earnings picture is improving, with FY 2017 profit seen up 8% and FY 2018 profit up 18%; revenue growth in Apple's services unit is currently at solid double-digit pace; and 4) the likelihood of a major iPhone replacement cycle beginning in the fourth quarter of the current calendar year is very high.IBD's TAKE: One way to track emerging industry sector rotation within the market is to watch changes in the IBD 50. Right now, it's still chock-full of electronic, internet, computer and networking-related stocks. But will medicals and biotechs stage a larger presence. Go here every day to watch new leaders unfold, presenting wonderful new opportunities for investing profits.In the IBD 50, tech leaders Nvidia (NVDA), Coherent (COHR) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) have all recovered nicely from price spills in the prior two weeks and remain in solid uptrends.RELATED:Investor's Corner: The Bottoming Base And How It Makes Money For Astute TradersInvestor's Corner II: Why Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009Where Is The Market Headed?

166,RHT,"XStocks opened higher and clung to narrow gains early Wednesday, as a string of positive earnings reports boosted early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each fought to hold gains of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq jumped 0.3%,with CA (CA), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Broadcom (AVGO) leading the Nasdaq 100.Intel (INTC) staked out the weak spot among Dow stocks, down 1.6% after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral, from buy. Nike (NKE) jumped 1.1%, the best early move among Dow industrials,Intel may also have felt some pressure from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which surged 8% after introducing a new line of high-power, low-cost processors aimed squarely at Intel's markets. The gain hoisted AMD shares 38% above an early May low, and well up the right side of a three-month cup base.FedEx (FDX) dipped 1% after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday.Red Hat (RHT) spiked 9% as Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, following strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. A 12% earnings gain and a 19% rise in revenue neatly cleared analysts' targets, and management's second-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts were also above expectations. The move sent the open-source software innovator to new highs in heavy trade, after clearing a long, sloppy consolidation in February.CA, the former Computer Associates, spiked 15% on news reports that privately held BMC Software was exploring financing options to acquire the provider of information technology management software. CA has market capitalization of roughly $13 billion. The gap up move sent shares above a 35.09 buy point in a six-month cup base.Adobe Systems jumped 3% in early trade, after reporting better-than-expected 44% gains in earnings and a 27% rise in revenue. The company also guided third-quarter sales and earnings to above consensus views. Adobe shares spiked to a new high, leaving them extended above a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average.Winnebago (WGO) rolled up a 4% gain at the open, as a 75% surge in revenue and a 134% leap in gross profit apparently outweighed a miss on its earnings per share line for its fiscal third quarter. The strong-volume gain was enough to pierce resistance at the stock's 10-week line, starting it up the right side of a six-month correction.CarMax (KMX) vaulted 5% higher on better-than-forecast first-quarter results. The company said delays in federal income tax refunds shifted some sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, helping results.  The stock has climbed 35% in the past 12 months, climbing from a February 2016 low.Overseas, in Asia, markets dropped hard in Tokyo and Hong Kong with benchmark indexes down 0.5% on each exchange. In Shanghai, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% after index provider MSCI voted to include 222 China-listed big cap A-share stocks in its emerging markets benchmark index.A shares are denominated in Chinese currency and were, until recently, restricted only to domestic investors.  Deutsche Banks X-Trackers Harvest CSI China A-Shares Fund (ASHR) rose 0.1% in premarket trade. Morgan Stanley's China A-Shares Fund (CAF) dipped 0.3%.Markets in Europe were under pressure, but off earlier lows in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.4%, Frankfurt's DAX off 0.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris sliding 0.5%.The U.S. dollar flattened into narrowly mixed trade. Gold gained 0.5% to near $1,245 an ounce. Bonds inched higher, trimming the 10-year yield by one basis point to 2.15%.In oil prices, U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude reversed early losses to rise 0.2% to just below $44 a barrel as investors waited on the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report, due out at 10 a.m. ET.Existing home sales numbers for May are due out from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:This Tech Stock Nears A Breakout On Speculation Of Amazon BuyoutBiotech Breakouts: Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ In Buy Zone

167,RHT,"A bullish Morgan Stanley reports calls Salesforce.com (CRM) the most likely software company to next hit the milestone of a $100 billion market valuation, though it says security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is also in the hunt.Salesforce.com, a top provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service, has a market cap of $56 billion, while Palo Alto’s valuation is nearly $13 billion.“With the most customer data in the cloud and multiple solutions targeting over 62 million users, we see Salesforce.com as the clear leader in SaaS-based applications and well on their way to a $100 billion market cap,” Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research report.Salesforce.com stock has rallied since early February, after plunging at the start of 2016. Salesforce stock ended trading up 1.3% to 82.75 in the stock market today. Salesforce.com has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible.IBD Take: How does Salesforce.com rate a 99 CR? Find out with IBD Stock Checkup.As for Palo Alto Networks, Weiss wrote that “to achieve the revenue scale necessary to become a $100 billion market cap company, Palo Alto must successfully expand their focus from the network security segment to the broader pool of overall security spending.”Weiss says Red Hat (RHT) is also well positioned in the cloud market but might not reach the $100 billion valuation mark. It's now less than $14 billion.As for a couple of other fast-growing SaaS providers, Weiss points to stiff competition.“In our view, the problem with Qlik Technologies (QLIK) or Tableau Software (DATA) becoming the next $100 billion company is the competitive environment,” he wrote.Salesforce.com will remain strong in SaaS, Weiss says, despite cloud competition from the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). San Francisco-based Salesforce.com garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software delivered via the Internet cloud. It's the No. 1 provider of customer relationship software.“With SaaS-based applications' faster innovation cycles and easier integration of new functionality, it becomes harder for vendors to sustain differentiation and enables (broad product) vendors to garner broader ecosystems and higher market share -- as seen by Salesforce.com's 40%+ share of the sales force automation market,” Weiss wrote.
"
168,RHT,"Despite a fourth-quarter earnings report that flew past estimates, Red Hat (RHT) stock fell Wednesday as analysts raised concerns of an unexpected slowdown.The line item that spooked investors was a slowing in customer billings and confusion about future revenue.“The fourth quarter was a mixed bag, with signs that fundamentals remain strong with large deals, but also billings deceleration and a lack of margin expansion for fiscal 2017,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Ben McFadden.Red Hat stock was down more than 5%, below 72, in morning trading on the stock market today. Shares had touched a 15-month low below 60 last month after hitting a 16-year high above 84 in December.Red Hat is the leading provider of Linux-based software that businesses use to run operations. Revenue comes from subscriptions that customers pay for software support, training and integration services in using the open-source version of its Linux operating system.Red Hat reported fiscal Q4 earnings after the market close Tuesday for the quarter that ended Feb. 29. Revenue rose 17% to $544 million, or 21% in constant currency, year over year. Earnings per share minus items jumped 21% to 52 cents, the fourth quarter in a row of double-digit gains. Both beat Wall Street estimates. First-quarter revenue guidance also beat, though EPS only met expectations.“Growth of reported billings and deferred revenue were not very good relative to expectations,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman wrote in a research note. ""Red Hat’s quarter had something for both bulls and bears.”For the past seven quarters, deferred revenue grew by an average of 20% year over year. In fiscal Q4, it rose 17.6%. Billings rose 13%, compared with the average of 19% in the prior three quarters, Bachman wrote. He maintained an outperform rating on Red Hat stock but lowered his price target to 88 from 90, based on concerns about lower billings and cash flow.RBC Capital Markets maintained an outperform rating on Red Hat with a price target of 95. Needham kept a buy rating and price target of 98.Red Hat has made a strategic shift to cloud computing, a fast-growing tech field dominated by Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). In November, Red Hat announced a partnership with Microsoft, which made Red Hat software available on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.Amazon is being watched by analysts in light of its Amazon Web Services stepping up Linux offerings, in competition with Red Hat.

Among biotechs, Amgen (AMGN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) scored gains of 2% or more.In the stock market today, IBD's airline group slumped 2.5% early but moved nicely off its lows. It was recently down 0.6%. One of the leaders in the group, Ryanair (RYAAY) gapped down to its 50-day average but rallied off lows. Shares fell 1% as it works on a cup-with-handle base with an 85.71 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), Trex (TREX) and Stamps.com (STMP) were among the top percentage gainers with gains of 2% or more.Also in the IBD 50, U.S. Concrete (USCR) followed through after Monday's breakout from a cup-with-handle base. Shares rose nearly 2%.Elsewhere, small cap Granite Construction (GVA) outperformed, rising 3.5%. It's near the high end of a buy range from a 44.50 buy point.In the semiconductor space, small cap Inphi (IPHI) extended gains after a recent breakout from a double-bottom base. Shares rose 4%. Group peer Mellanox (MLNX) also outperformed with a 4% gain.After the close, watch for earnings from Dow-component Nike (NKE), Five Below (FIVE) and Red Hat (RHT).

Nike shares dropped 2.9% in extended trading.Red Hat (RHT) beat Q4 estimates for the top and bottom lines. Revenue climbed 17% while adjusted earnings jumped 21%. The software company’s full-year guidance beat views, and so did its Q1 revenue outlook. But its Q1 earnings projection was in-line with estimates. Shares fell 0.5% in late trade.Five Below’s (FIVE) 26% Q4 earnings increase and 24% revenue rise topped analyst expectations. The teen-focused discount retailer’s Q1 and full-year guidance was conservative. Shares sank 4.5% in after-hours trade.Uniform rental company Cintas (CTAS) beat Q3 estimates, with earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $1.22 billion. Cintas shares rallied 1.3% late.And Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) fell 7% after hours after quarterly sales missed expectations.

176,RHT,"The Federal Reserve said the case for a rate hike had ""strengthened,"" but stocks rallied as policymakers indicated the path of increases would be even slower. Congress grilled two big CEOs, the federal government announced autonomous driving guidelines, while Yahoo (YHOO) and Facebook (FB) made embarrassing disclosures.The Nasdaq climbed to an all-time high, fueled by the Fed's decision to further lower the likely rate-hike trajectory. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, but closed below its 50-day after retaking that key support on Thursday. Oil, metal and mining stocks fared well while retail groups struggled.The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but signaled it will hike its key rate in December. Still, markets were pleased that Fed members' own projections point to just two hikes in 2017. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan said it will intervene to keep 10-year government bond yields at roughly 0% and said it will now aim to overshoot its 2% inflation target. Neither move to weaken the currency impressed investors, as the yen rose close to a two-year high after the BoJ meeting.Divided Fed Holds Off On Rate Hike, Sees Slower Tightening PathNote To The Fed: The Job Market Just Took A Wrong TurnThe Department of Transportation unveiled long-awaited federal autonomous vehicle guidelines. The new rules will provide Tesla Motors (TSLA), Ford Motor (F), Alphabet (GOOGL), General Motors (GM) and others that are developing self-driving cars a framework on safety guidelines, and will pre-empt state laws. DOT said the new guidelines are rooted in a view that automated vehicles hold enormous potential benefits for safety, mobility and sustainability.Alphabet was an early pioneer in self-driving cars, but Tesla has been the most aggressive in pushing the technology. Tesla updated its Autopilot driver assistance technology, with greater emphasis on radar.Apple (AAPL), which reportedly has hit the brakes on developing a car in-house, has approached McLaren Technology Group, a British luxury-car maker, about a possible acquisition, the Financial Times reported.

McLaren denied the reports, saying the company is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.RELATED:Tesla Just Made 3 Big Moves That Are Key To Its FutureApple In Talks To Buy Luxury-Car Maker McLaren: ReportYahoo (YHOO) disclosed that confidential information was taken from at least 500 million user accounts in late 2014, likely by a ""state-sponsored actor."" Passwords were stolen, but not payment information. Yahoo urged users to change passwords and security questions if they haven't been updated since 2014. It's unclear if this will affect the sale of Yahoo's core operations to Verizon (VZ) for $4.8 billion, including regulatory and legal issues. Yahoo shares fell 2% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) shares spiked 21% Friday on reports that the struggling social network was mulling putting itself up for sale, with Salesforce (CRM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) as possible buyers.Facebook (FB) disclosed late Thursday that it gave advertisers inflated figures on how long people watched their videos, for two years.

For the current quarter, the media and marketing software company expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 86 cents on sales of $1.58 billion, topping views. Adobe shares rose nearly 9% to a record high.Enterprise software provider Red Hat (RHT) on Wednesday also beat views. It earned 55 cents a share minus items, up 17%, on sales of $600 million, up 19%, for its fiscal Q2 ended Aug. 31. It gave Q3 guidance that topped Wall Street expectations.

But a builder sentiment gauge rose to an 11-year high. Meanwhile, KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected earnings. Lennar (LEN) also topped on earnings, but orders and margins fell. Lennar also will buy WCI Communities (WCIC) for $643 million. The Fed's slower rate-hike path also is good news for the housing sector.RELATED:Existing-Home Sales Unexpectedly Fall In August To 5.33 Million RateBotox-maker Allergan (AGN) jumped in Tuesday on the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) when it announced its $1.7 billion plan to acquire Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA). Tobira stock shot up 721% on Tuesday. Later that day, Allergan paid $50 million for Akarna Therapeutics, another NASH developer. In the NASH avenue, Allergan will compete against Gilead (GILD), Intercept (ICPT), Novartis (NVS) and Enanta (ENTA). Also, last week, Allergan announced plans to buy Vitae Pharmaceuticals, working to combat psoriasis, eczema and autoimmune disorders and ophthalmology gene therapist RetroSense.Various OPEC members hinted at support for an output curb ahead of an informal meeting of top OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Algeria this week, but others downplayed the likelihood of any decision. Oil prices rose 2% to $44.48 a barrel in an up-and-down week, despite a 4% drop Friday. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude stockpiles fell 6.2 million barrels to 504.6 million barrels, a seven-month low.

Still, Mylan stock rose fractionally for the week.Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO John Stumpf became a Senate panel's punching bag Tuesday, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., urging him to resign over the bank's cross-selling scandal. Stumpf, who said he learned about the issue in 2013, said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the sales practices, and the bank said it was ending retail-banking sales goals. Authorities say Wells employees, starting in at least 2011, opened up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts in attempt to hit sales targets. Some analysts said the financial fallout – a $185 million fine to regulators but with a U.S. investigation intensifying -- appeared limited, for now. Shares rose 0.7% for the week after dropping nearly 7% in the prior week.At Goldman Sachs' Communacopia media conference, Big Media seemed unworried about cord-cutting, with CBS (CBS) chief Les Moonves saying the Netflix (NFLX) ""Star Trek"" licensing-rights deal paid for the costs of CBS' new ""Star Trek"" series.

178,RHT,"Tech stocks continued to lead the U.S. market higher Monday. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, showed potential of recouping some of the nearly 9% decline suffered over the prior two weeks and continuing its solid uptrend since its January breakout past an early-stage cup-with-handle base at 118.12.The stock rebounded 4.12, or 2.9%, to 146.39 in volume that edged 2% above normal levels. Apple is also up 26% since Jan. 1, more than double the 9.5% gain for the S&P 500. Both the 500 (up 0.8%) and the Dow Jones industrials (up 0.7%) hit all-time new highs in the stock market today.But at the market's close at 4 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite reaffirmed its market leadership, stretching its gain to 1.4% and holding practically at session highs, and extending its year-to-date gain to 15.9%.Small caps lagged, as the S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 0.5%.In the Dow 30 industrials, as many as nine members are up one point or more, including top-tier banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Reuters reported an estimate by a Morgan Stanley analyst that the main banks have as much as $150 billion in idle cash that could be funneled toward future dividend hikes and share buybacks.The Federal Reserve is set to release initial results on Thursday of a two-part annual stress test of major Wall Street banks. The stress test, created in the wake of the 2008-2009 subprime debt debacle, offers investors the central U.S. bank's view of how the nation's biggest lenders would handle a future economic or financial shock that could rattle the banking system.IBD analyzes the market action based on the movement of 197 industry groups and subgroups each day. Among the top 10 performers on Monday, six six hailed from the medical, computer and electronics sectors, including biotechs, generic drugs, integrated computer systems, computer networking and fabless semiconductors. You can check the individual stocks and ratings for all of these industry groups by going to MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock screening and charting service.Integrated oil, water utility, oil drilling and gas distribution companies led the market's downside, falling 0.9% or more. WTI crude oil futures slid 1.2% to $44.20 a barrel, while NYMEX natural gas futures collapsed more than 4% to $2.89 per 1 million BTUs, a new 3-month low. The Dow utility average slipped 0.4%. Long-term interest rates edged up, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark bond rising to 2.19%.Market breadth is positive, with winners beating losers by a nearly 9-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and an 18-11 ratio on the NYSE. Volume was down sharply on the main exchanges vs. the same time Friday. Stock and index options expired Friday, resulting in higher volume. This column last week noted that Apple posted a pair of sell signals for short-term investors: 1) dropping sharply below its 10-week moving average in accelerating volume; and 2) giving back all of its gains from a four-weeks-tight entry at 141.12. But the iPhone maker could also have been held by longtime holders who have a big enough profit cushion to give the stock a chance to rise back above the 10-week line or possibly test the longer-term 40-week moving average, roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart.Apple is now less than three points away from retaking the 10-week line.Another fellow tech component in the Dow 30, Microsoft (MSFT) is holding up firmly since it broke out of a base-on-base setup at 58.80 in the week ended Oct. 21, 2016. The Xbox and business software firm, up 1% to 70.87, has gained nearly 24% since that October breakout. The S&P 500 has risen 14% over the same time frame. Both Apple and Microsoft pay dividends, and the annualized yields are 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The S&P 500 has a 1.91% yield. Microsoft's long-term cash payout growth is 15% each year, according to calculations by William O'Neil + Co.An ongoing rebound in fundamentals for both Apple and Microsoft, plus the outperformance of the tech sector in 2017 so far, are two reasons why the two megacap names have good prospects for beating the S&P 500's return this year.Among the top five sectors in IBD's daily ranking of 33 broad sectors, three of the top five are from tech land: Electronics (No. 1), Chips (No. 2), and Computer (No. 4). The other two in the top five are Leisure (No. 3) and Building (No. 5).IBD's TAKE: Apple, due to the majority of its revenue now coming from the iPhone, is part of the Telecom sector, which is now ranked No. 14 out of 33 broad industry sectors. A strong sector performance often helps a growth stock achieve above-average returns. See the entire list of sectors, ranked daily, via the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Microsoft ranks No. 3 within the desktop software industry group in terms of its 82 Composite Rating. It trails group leader Adobe Systems (ADBE) (96 Composite) and Red Hat (RHT) (92). However, Microsoft has successfully turned around its recent slump in revenue with gains of 1% and 8% vs. year-ago levels in the prior two quarters. Microsoft had suffered a six-quarter drought of flat or falling sales.Microsoft also sports a top-notch A rating for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity).Elsewhere in the stock market today, MasTec (MTZ) rallied more than 2% to 45.60 in quiet trade. Read more about the base this building and maintenance services firm is forming in IBD's Stocks Near A Buy Zone feature, available in the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.Broadcom (AVGO) rallied more than 2% to 241.15 in slightly above-average turnover; the top-quality semiconductor stock is once again extended a little more than 5% past a 227.85 flat-base entry. Lam Research (LRCX), a former Big Cap 20 member, hopped off its 50-day line, rising almost 2% to 150.97. Volume ran up 24% higher than the stock's 50-day average of 2.24 million shares.As noted in the latest IBD Weekly print edition, last week's negative reversal in heavy volume marked a sell signal following the chip equipment firm's outstanding run.Yet for now, the stock is getting vital buying support at the 50-day moving average, a key trait among leading growth stocks.Lam is No. 5 in the IBD 50. The Street expects earnings to rise 57% to $9.88 a share in fiscal 2017 ending in June; but growth is expected to slow to 10% in FY 2018. Keep in mind, however, that Lam has beaten the consensus profit estimate by nearly 6% on average over the past four quarters.Some consumer spending plays are also thriving; please check IBD Weekly in pages B1 to B4 and see the chart analysis for every minichart of the IBD 50. From April 11, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2016, the total return of the IBD 50 is 750%, vs. a 242% gain for the S&P 500 (excluding dividends).RELATED:Inside The IBD 50: So, How Much Further Can The Leaders FallHow Should I Track The Market: The Big Picture Can HelpWhat's The Simplest Way To Spot Major Market Tops?

180,RHT,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

181,RHT,"Red Hat's (RHT) big bet on OpenStack, a cloud computing software standard, seems to be paying off in the wake of its fourth-quarter revenue beat, say analysts.At least five sell-side analysts raised their price targets on Red Hat, which late Monday also reported in-line fourth-quarter earnings and forecast full-year fiscal 2018 revenue above expectations.Shares in Red Hat, the No. 1 provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers, jumped 5.2% to close at 86.48 on the stock market today.""Approximately one-third of Red Hat's largest deals in Q4 contained OpenStack and the company now has over 500 customers running OpenStack,"" said Brian White, an analyst at Drexel Hamilton, in a report. White hiked his price target to 110 from 105.Citigroup raised its price target to 105 from 91, RBC Capital to 98 from 95, Jefferies to 83 from 76, and Mizuho Securities to 96 from 94.""Highlights in Q4 included one megadeal over $100 million and billings well ahead of consensus,"" said Rob Oliver, a Baird analyst in a report. ""Emerging products revenue accelerated as OpenShift and OpenStack investments are beginning to bear fruit.""IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat stock has bounced back from the late December sell-off, after fiscal third-quarter revenue and guidance disappointed, rising nearly 19% in 2017 and moving above its 50-day moving average. Before the earnings release, the stock had been consolidating with a technical buy point of 82.83. Learn more about Red Hat's technical chart at IBD Stock Checkup.Red Hat, similar to Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and VMware, has aimed to leverage its existing customer base as cloud computing gains momentum.Red Hat said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 17% to 61 cents with revenue climbing 16% to $629 million.Red Hat said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue of $646.5 million at its midpoint of guidance and unadjusted earnings in a range of 52 to 53 cents a share. For all of fiscal 2018, Red Hat forecast revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $2.62 a share vs. consensus estimates of $2.7 billion and $2.59.""Heavy reliance on large deals, lumpiness of the OpenStack business, a back-end loaded year, and increased linearity will likely be sources of volatility,"" said Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst in a report.RELATED:'Real Muscle' In Alliance Of Two Cisco Rivals, Says AnalystAdobe, Microsoft Join Forces In Sales, Marketing Software

183,RHT,"Amazon (AMZN), Red Hat (RHT) and Tesaro (TSRO) got price target hikes Tuesday, while Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) was started with a hold rating.Loop Capital started Snap with a 21 price target and a hold rating, coming after Goldman Sachs and Jefferies put buy ratings on the stock Monday.Analysts had been bearish on the stock after its initial public offering on March 2, giving the picture and video sharing social network sell ratings, but more recent ratings have been upbeat, signaling a shift in sentiment.Shares tumbled 6.8% to 22.21, as Facebook (FB) announced new features that mimic Snapchat's.IBD'S TAKE: While Snap has now received several buy ratings and is said to have replaced Twitter as the No. 2 social networking platform among advertisers, it faces a formidable rival in Facebook and the low Accumulation/Distribution rating on Snap's stock indicates selling by institutional investors.

184,RHT,"Red Hat (RHT) late Wednesday reported fiscal Q3 earnings that edged views, but revenue missed estimates and the enterprise software provider forecast current-quarter sales well below consensus estimates.Shares in the No. 1 provider of open-source Linux software plunged 13% in late trading on the stock market today.Red Hat said earnings per share minus items rose 27% to 61 cents from the year-earlier quarter, topping consensus estimates of 58 cents. Revenue climbed 17% to $615 million, the company said. Analysts, however, had projected revenue of $621.7 million.For the current quarter, Red Hat forecast EPS of 61 cents, in-line with views. Red Hat said it expects revenue of $618 million at its midpoint of guidance — well below consensus estimates of $637.7 million.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat has the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of the eight companies in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop group, which also includes Microsoft and Adobe Systems. The group ranks only No. 144 out of 197 industry groups.Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.Analysts have been looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a Red Hat partner.The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat's cloud revenue mainly comes from customers using RHEL software on a ""pay as you go,"" or software-as-a-service, basis.Frank Calderoni, executive vice president and CFO, has notified Red Hat of his decision to step down in late January 2017, to enable him to accept a CEO position at another company.RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoMicrosoft Stock Gets Price-Target Hike As Cloud Bets Pay OffRed Hat Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Q3 Guidance Top Views, Stock Rises

186,RHT,"There's a notion out there, says Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead, that Amazon’s (AMZN) flavor of the Linux open-source operating system is about as good as other Linux distributions -- and since it's free and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers good support, converting is cheap.So does that stand to hurt Red Hat (RHT), which reports its fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 earnings after the stock market close Tuesday?""Bottom line, we conclude that the number of migrations from RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) to Amazon Linux remains quite modest and mostly confined to small enterprise customers,"" Keirstead wrote in a research note March 13. ""Larger RHEL-centric customers have only a small mix of workloads on AWS, they value OS consistency across their hybrid infrastructures, they prefer support from RHT and/or view the cost savings of a switch as being too modest to be worth the hassle.""These advantages appear to more than offset a view that AMZN Linux is at/near functional parity with other Linux distributions.""Keirstead reiterated Deutsche's buy rating for Red Hat with a 95 price target, which might take Red Hat a couple of months to achieve if it stays on the same upward trajectory that it's maintained since bottoming out Feb. 8 at a two-year low of 59.59.Red Hat stock was unchanged at 74.90 on Monday after rising 3.2% last week, closing just below its 200-day moving average. Shares are just 12% off a 16-year high set Dec. 30, 24% above its Feb. 8 low.But it looks like Red Hat is rebounding firmly from the Software Sag of '16 that battered many of Red Hat's rivals and tech players in January through early February.Red Hat stock gets an IBD Composite Rating of 84 out of a possible 99, factoring in earnings, sales, stock performance, institutional ownership and other metrics. Enterprise software developer Salesforce.com (CRM) carries an 81, Microsoft (MSFT) ranks 76, software giant Oracle (ORCL) earns a 61 and SAP (SAP) a 70.For its Q4 ended Feb. 29, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Red Hat earnings per share up 9% from a year earlier to 47 cents minus items, matching the company's guidance. Analysts expect revenue up 16% to $537 million, which also would match the midpoint of the company's guidance of between $535 million and $539 million, and rival the year-ago sales growth rate of 16%.At those levels, Q4 would be Red Hat's first quarter decelerated to single-digit growth since EPS flattened at 42 cents in fiscal 2015's Q3. It would be the 16th consecutive quarter of mid-to-high-teens sales growth.In a research note issued Thursday, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley warned that Red Hat's long-term revenue growth in Q4 could have fallen below expectations as seen in historical, sequential long-term growth weakness every three years, going back to Q4 2007. This is due to what he theorizes as three pools of larger deals that renew every three years in Q4, with the most recent cohort in Q4 being smaller than the others.""We believe this nuance (if correct) is truly just 'noise' and short-term billings should remain strong,"" Ashley said.He models Q4's total billings growth (long-term and short-term) at a 10% year-to-year improvement vs. the 12% consensus.""Where could we be wrong?"" Ashley asked. ""Signing a bunch of 'new' large three-year deals could augment the smaller renewal pool.""He tipped his hat to Baird's outperform rating on Red Hat with an 80 price target.

Mike Rogers is also speaking at the conference.The conference comes as the FBI and Apple are turning to Congress to settle a dispute over ""back doors"" that would allow officials, and potentially hackers, to decrypt customer data.Apple opposes a court order that would force it to hack into an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack, citing the 1st Amendment.

Microsoft rose 3.3%, Facebook added 2.7%, and Alphabet climbed 3.5%.Cyberwarfare has become a focus in the fight against the Islamic State. At a Pentagon briefing Monday, Carter said forces were employing cyber warfare against ISIS, alongside traditional forces but didn't go into specifics.""At the same time, we're bombing ISIL's banks as well as oil wells they've taken over or coerced others into operating on their behalf,"" Carter said. ""We're also using cyber tools to disrupt ISIL's ability to operate and communicate over the virtual battlefield.""Carter said the cyberattacks were aimed at interrupting the Islamic State's ""ability to command and control forces there, control the population and the economy.""Meanwhile, the Pentagon has requested $7 billion in 2017 and $35 billion over the next five years to build up cyber capabilities.Silicon Valley and government agencies, especially the DOD,  have been at odds for years. Tech companies are especially leery of the Pentagon after Edward Snowden’s leaks over digital surveillance.But Carter has been a strong advocate for cooperation between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley and last year he became the first sitting Pentagon chief in nearly two decades to visit the tech hub.

198,RHT,"Red Hat's (RHT) fledgling cloud business is expected to be a hot topic at Thursday's investor day, as the Linux software leader Wednesday added support for its third public cloud computing service, Google Cloud Platform.Red Hat, which provides open source software products widely used in corporate data centers, inked earlier partnerships with the other two cloud services leaders: Amazon.com's (AMZN) AWS and Microsoft (MSFT). With Google on board, Red Hat now supports the three biggest cloud platforms.Some analysts, however, are looking for more information on how Red Hat's cloud business is doing. The company didn't say much on its fiscal Q1 earnings call on June 22, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss lamented in a research report.""While management continues to note that the cloud service provider business remains the fastest-growing segment at Red Hat, it has not provided an update on revenue contribution since fiscal Q2 2016 ($100 million annualized run rate for the period ended Aug. 31, 2015),"" Weiss wrote. ""Lack of detail on the cloud business and its potential contribution to the mix in the years ahead makes it more difficult to ascertain underlying billing growth trends, in our view.""Red Hat last week reported fiscal Q1 earnings that met Wall Street views, but its EPS outlook was a bit light.

212,RHT,"Microsoft (MSFT) remains the top ""strategic vendor"" of large companies, but Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Red Hat (RHT) will make gains over the next three years, thanks to their cloud computing prowess, says a Goldman Sachs survey of chief information officers.Microsoft, with its Office suite, is the leading provider of business productivity software, which is widely used in corporate data centers. Microsoft has also expanded into cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, part of e-commerce giant Amazon, is by the far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), but Microsoft is No. 2, and Alphabet-owned Google No. 3.

Alphabet advanced 1.3%, moving above its 50-day line close to its 200-day.Large companies continue to shift business workloads to cloud service providers, the Goldman Sachs survey says.

The deal will dilute fiscal 2017 earnings per share minus items by 3 cents, Red Hat said.But billings -- both the results and the outlook -- remain positives, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.""Billings of $522 million grew 16% year over year and were above Street estimate of $520 million,"" he said.

""It's logical to us that enterprises would want to use the same technology in development and testing in the cloud.""Ben McFadden, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, says Red Hat notched some bigger deals.""Red Hat had two deals over $10 million in the quarter and six more above $5 million, both records for fiscal Q1, as enterprise customers are increasingly buying a much larger portfolio of solutions,"" he wrote.

Terms weren't revealed but Red Hat said the deal would lower non-GAAP EPS this quarter by a penny and lower it by 3 cents for the fiscal year.For Q1 ended May 31, Red Hat said earnings per share minus items rose 14% from the year-earlier quarter, to 50 cents, while sales rose 18% to $568 million. The company, which is pushing its public cloud business, guided to EPS ex items of 54 cents for the current quarter, on sales of $590 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q1 EPS ex items of 50 cents, on sales of $563 million.

API management is becoming more important to large companies as business resources are made accessible to mobile devices. 3scale's rivals include Apigee (APIC) and privately held companies Layer 7 and Mashery.Acquiring 3scale ""is a great tie-in with (Red Hat's) mobile offering,"" Al Hilwa, an analyst with tech market research firm IDC, said in an email. ""Red Hat acquired FeedHenry almost two years ago and got some back-end capabilities at the time, but 3Scale takes Red Hat's API capabilities to a whole other level.""

234,RHT,"Actively managed ETFs held a total $21.84 billion in assets through October, up nearly 30% from the end of 2014. While active exchange-traded funds are a speck in the roughly $2 trillion ETF landscape, they're growing fast.The first active ETF debuted in 2008. More than half are less than 2 years old.These ETF investment strategies often seek to outperform their benchmark indexes. Like most mutual funds, active ETFs have fund managers who decide which securities to include in the portfolio.Active ETFs usually ""don't take off like lightning"" but are seeing steady and significant growth nonetheless, says Noah Hamman, CEO of AdvisorShares, an active ETF sponsor that recently published an industry landscape report.""When performance is there, people are willing to use them in a portfolio,"" Hamman said.Here are five winners in 2015:• ARK Web x.0 (ARKW) has gained 15% year to date through Friday vs. 7% for the tech fund category.The ETF invests in innovative companies disrupting traditional business models. It focuses on businesses benefiting from the shift from hardware and software toward cloud computing, Big Data, wearable technology, social media and the Internet of Things.ARKW holds 38 stocks. The top five include AthenaHealth (ATHN), LinkedIn (LNKD), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Red Hat (RHT).However, the ETF's 0.95% expense ratio is higher than most indexed peers, and assets and trading volume are relatively meager.• SPDR MFS Systematic Growth Equity (SYG) has risen 9.4% year to date vs. 6.1% for the large growth fund category.The ETF screens for stocks based on fundamental and quantitative factors. Top holdings out of 50 include Amazon, Apple (AAPL) and biotech giant Gilead Sciences (GILD).SYG's 0.6% expense ratio is three times that of its passive peer, iShares Russell 1000 Growth (IWF). SYG holds $9.4 million in assets.• Columbia Large Cap Growth (RPX) is another solid choice for successful investing with actively managed ETF strategies. Its 9.9% gain this year —and 22% average annual the past three years — have beaten the large-growth category.• IShares Enhanced International Small-Cap (IEIS) is outpacing its segment so far in 2015. IEIS is up 7.9% in 2015 vs. 3.1% for the foreign small/mid-value fund category.• AdvisorShares WCM/BNY Focused Growth ADR (AADR) is ahead too.AADR is up 6.3% vs. 2.7% for the foreign large-growth category. It has also outperformed over three- and five-year periods of time.The ETF owns 31 stocks, including top holding Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). The concentrated portfolio holds only the fund managers' best stock investing ideas, Hamman said. Their ""stock selection really has added value,"" he added.IEIS has a 0.49% expense ratio, with AADR at 1.27%.• AdvisorShares Gartman Gold Euro (GEUR) is up 1.9% year to date vs. a 21.3% loss for the precious metals commodity fund category and a 9.3% loss for SPDR Gold Shares (GLD).GEUR uses a somewhat complex investing method. It invests in gold using euros, going long on gold futures and short on euro futures. That strategy has worked in a rising dollar environment.""Now investors can diversify themselves,"" Hamman said. ""They don't have to have just GLD. They can pair this up and balance that exposure a bit.""GEUR has a 0.65% expense ratio vs. 0.40% for GLD.

235,RHT,"Leading Linux software provider Red Hat (RHT) late Tuesday reported fiscal Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations and helped ease fears of tech spending softening, but its EPS outlook for the current quarter merely met views.Shares were down 4% in after-hours trading, after the earnings release. In Tuesday’s regular session, Red Hat stock rose 1.1% to 75.71. Shares had touched a 15-month low below 60 last month after hitting a 16-year high above 84 in December.The Raleigh, N.C.-based company posted earnings per share minus items of 52 cents, up 21% from the year-earlier quarter. Sales for the quarter that ended Feb. 29 rose 17% to $544 million.Both numbers beat the consensus estimate. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average had expected the cloud vendor to report EPS ex items of 47 cents on revenue of $537 million.For its fiscal Q1, Red Hat guided EPS ex items at 50 cents on revenue of $558 million to $566 million, vs. 44 cents and $481 million in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had modeled 50 cents and $554.6 million, so while the sales outlook beat, the EPS outlook merely met.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White called Q4 “another strong quarter” with a “strong revenue outlook” in a research note after the earnings release.Red Hat revenue comes from subscriptions that customers pay for support, training and integration services in using the open-source version of its Linux operating system. The platform includes applications, middleware, desktop domains and an operating system. Red Hat was founded 23 years ago.“The fourth quarter marked our 56th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, contributing to Red Hat’s first fiscal year crossing $2 billion in total revenue,” Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst said in the company's earnings release. “The fourth quarter was a strong close to the year as our results exceeded our guidance.“We maintained a high level of execution throughout the fiscal year, which contributed to greater than 20% constant currency revenue growth in each quarter.”Red Hat said that it had ended the year with a record backlog of $2.13 billion, up 15% year over year.The company has made a strategic shift to cloud computing, a fast-growing tech field dominated by Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Red Hat has been able to carve out a share of the pie. It focuses on hybrid cloud services, which partly use the low-cost public cloud and partly provide the privacy of private cloud services.""Investors have asked whether the public cloud is a positive driver for Red Hat,"" Whitehurst said on the company's earnings conference call. “We firmly believe that it will be a hybrid cloud world where applications will run across all four footprints -- physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud.“We are providing technologies that enable choice and consistency across all four environments, and we enhance this value with application development technologies, storage and management.”In November, Red Hat announced a partnership with Microsoft, which made the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) available on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. As part of the deal, Red Hat will provide Microsoft with its enterprise version of Linux for use as the “preferred choice” on Microsoft's Azure cloud services.Microsoft, formerly a rival, has been rolling out other Red Hat products, including its JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Gluster Storage and platform-as-a-service product OpenShift.In a research note Monday, Drexel analyst White said that the movement toward open-source software and the momentum to cloud computing “will provide enough of a tailwind to offset any macro softening.” White rates Red Hat stock a buy, with a price target of 98.“We believe Linux will continue to gain market share in 2016 as next-generation applications are developed on RHEL, while we look forward to development of the Microsoft partnership,” White wrote.In a research note last week, Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead raised the issue about competition from Amazon, which offers a free Linux open-source operating system and support via its cloud-based Amazon Web Services platform.He concluded that the number of migrations from RHEL to Amazon Linux remains quite modest and mostly confined to small enterprise customers.“Larger RHEL-centric customers have only a small mix of workloads on Amazon Web Services, they value operating system consistency across their hybrid infrastructures, they prefer support from Red Hat and/or view the cost savings of a switch as being too modest to be worth the hassle,” Keirstead wrote.He reiterated a buy rating on Red Hat stock, with a 95 price target.Image provided by Shutterstock.

237,RHT,"AT&T (T) will likely be the biggest user of OpenStack cloud computing software worldwide, says a Goldman Sachs report on growth in private clouds.“AT&T will likely become the largest OpenStack environment in the world, as they expect to build out their private cloud to 500,000 nodes (servers) and span across hundreds of data centers,” said Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst, in a research report.AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) in January joined Facebook’s (FB) Open Compute Project, which helps companies design and build low-cost data centers with open-source software.Behind VMware (VMW) and Microsoft (MSFT), OpenStack is the third-most-popular software technology for private clouds  --  data centers that operate behind a corporate security firewall.OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers. Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard.Many companies now back OpenStack, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Red Hat (RHT), Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell.AT&T plans to transform its massive network by 2020 -- with software running on standard computing gear replacing specialized hardware.“AT&T hopes to run every call through its OpenStack infrastructure by 2020,” said the Goldman Sachs report. “The company believes it can take out  billions of dollars in capital spending and operating expenses from moving to private cloud as they can use commodity pizza boxes instead of proprietary Cisco boxes. The entire infrastructure will be automated, helping AT&T operate at a faster pace and bring in new services, which is easier to do when they are software-based.”AT&T is using OpenStack software provided by startup Mirantis, says Goldman Sachs. It says Verizon is also a Mirantis customer. Privately held Mirantis, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., says its investors include the venture capital arms of Intel, Ericsson (ERIC), Dell and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman Sachs says Red Hat and VMware are the leading providers of OpenStack software for private clouds.Image provided by Shutterstock.

238,RHT,"United Airlines (UAL) said on Monday that it had appointed three new independent directors to its board, a day after the company said that CEO and President Oscar Munoz will return to work full-time in those positions March 14 after suffering a heart attack in October that kept him on medical leave.The new appointments and Munoz's return follow months of turbulence in the company's C-suite. They also come as United's front office tries to keep investors happy and reverse a pattern of being upstaged by rivals American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).The three new directors bring with them considerable experience in the finance, airline and tech industries.James Kennedy is a former CEO of T. Rowe Price Group; Robert Milton is a former CEO of Aviation Holdings and Air Canada; James Whitehurst is the CEO of open-source IT company RedHat (RHT). A fourth appointment should come ""in the near term,"" the company said, adding that ""certain current directors will step down"" in the process.United shares closed down 0.7% in the stock market today, although the stock still has support above its 50- and 200-day lines. Delta dipped 0.6%, and  American rose 1.2%.Munoz, who suffered the heart attack after only about a month on the job, ""has already been participating actively in all major corporate decisions,"" the company said in a statement Sunday. He had been meeting with investors as of at least February, according to a Cowen research note.Brett Hart had been serving as acting chief executive. Jeff Smisek, Munoz's predecessor, stepped down last year amid a U.S. investigation into potential improper favor exchanges between United and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.United last month said that it had expected to accelerate its share repurchase program in the first quarter, a day after Delta announced a similar move. United also recently changed its board-nomination process to give some shareholders more power to nominate board members -- something that only board members had the authority to do in the past, according to Wolfe Research.""We are always looking at ways to enhance corporate governance at United,"" Henry L. Meyer, non-executive chairman, said in a statement Monday. ""For some time, the board has been evaluating potential director candidates with the assistance of a leading search firm and with the benefit of shareholder input.""""It is obvious there is a newfound sense of urgency at UAL, which we could clearly see when we went out there two weeks ago with investors,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last month.""CEO Oscar Munoz was fired up about making changes not only by bringing in fresh blood but creating a sense of urgency and transforming UAL into a ‘meritocracy’ where people get promoted based on merit, not familiarity.""In announcing the board changes, United also touted what it said were ""significant improvements"" in on-time performance in recent months despite harsh winter weather -- an area where it has lagged behind its other major rivals. United, like others, has also made small improvements to in-flight experience. Also like others, its profits have been greatly assisted by low oil prices.Still, labor relations remain contentious. United's mechanics rejected a proposed contract last month, although the air carrier had reached a tentative contract-extension deal with its dispatchers.

239,RHT,"Didn't take long for investors to follow analyst Gregg Moskowitz's upgrade clue.Red Hat (RHT) stock turned red hot again briefly, up 3% in morning trade in the stock market today, before cooling to close up 1.4% at 68.62 Thursday, 19% off a 16-year high of 84.44 touched Dec. 30.An analyst for Cowen, Moskowitz had just issued a research report Thursday morning, making the case that Red Hat's ""valuation looks compelling once again"" and upgrading the stock to outperform from market perform with an 86 price target. Red Hat, based in Raleigh, N.C., is the fast-growing developer of software, built on the open-source Linux operating system, that manages vast enterprise data, be they in the cloud or in traditional on-premise operations.Microsoft (MSFT) announced in November that it would run Red Hat hybrid software on Azure, Microsoft's cloud service.How fast is Red Hat moving? Earnings grew 14% and revenue 15% in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, although analysts polled by Thomson Reuters think that for the current quarter, Q4, profit will moderate to 9% growth from a year earlier of 47 cents per share minus items, on sales up 15.7% to $537 million.""While we have been positive on the stock for a long time, our recent market perform rating was largely valuation-based,"" Moskowitz said. ""However, the stock has significantly underperformed this year (down 18%, vs. the Nasdaq down 10%), which has presented investors with a favorable risk/reward once again.""Moskowitz said that his crew's recent checks with midsize and big IT customers suggest that Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) -- its core software, first issued 13 years ago -- is likely to grow faster than the 2% annual pace that research firm Gartner gives the overall Linux market.""Meanwhile, though not yet inflecting, demand for OpenStack continues to rise, and we expect another year of high growth (off a still relatively low base),"" Moskowitz wrote. OpenStack is a free, open-source software platform for cloud computing.""We also believe RHT’s recent partnership with Microsoft Azure (not in our numbers) should create significant revenue synergies for RHEL (and Azure) over time,"" Moskowitz added. ""Further, one of our public cloud contacts we recently spoke with sees material upside from the partnership and believes the power of Microsoft’s distribution could also drive an inflection in sales for RHT’s CloudForms hybrid cloud management software.""Longer term, we believe containers will become increasingly prevalent and that RHT is very well placed to benefit from this unfolding trend, with native support built into RHEL and OpenShift, and with RHEL Atomic Host specifically targeting the opportunity.""Containers allow software to run reliably in a variety of computing environments. OpenShift is a Red Hat platform-as-a-service product; RHEL Atomic Host is an operating system.With a market cap of $12.5 billion, Red Hat is the third largest member of IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group -- led, of course, by Microsoft with about a $409 billion market value. Adobe Systems (ADBE) is second-largest at just over $43 billion.Red Hat's stock, however, earns a 79 Composite Rating, which means that it performs better than 79% of all publicly traded firms on a variety of metrics. Microsoft carries a slightly better Composite Rating of 83 and Adobe a strong 96.Microsoft closed down 0.4% Thursday and Adobe fell 1.3%.    
"
240,RHT,"Investors doffed their caps to Red Hat (RHT) Friday, pushing its stock to fresh 15-year highs after the company late Thursday provided Q3 earnings and sales that beat analyst expectations, as did its Q4 sales guidance.Red hot Red Hat stock gapped up 5.7% to 83.99 at the opening of the stock market today, eclipsing a Nov. 5 peak that hadn't been seen since the 2000 dot-com bubble's peak, shortly after Red Hat went public. Shares eased back later, closing Friday at 81.40, up 3.2%.William Blair analyst Jason Ader, in a research note, called Red Hat's Q3 ""squeaky clean execution.""Needham's Scott Zeller raised his price target on Red Hat stock to 98 from 86 and reiterated its buy rating, saying that its guidance showed ""momentum."" RBC Capital and Stifel Nicolaus also hiked their price targets on Red Hat stock.""Red Hat delivered another clean quarter, with broad-based strength in all revenue categories and geographies, excellent billings growth (20% in constant currency) against a tough comparison and solid execution on margins,"" Ader wrote.Based in Raleigh, N.C., and built on Linux open source enterprise software, Red Hat posted EPS ex items of 48 cents, up 14% from the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 15% to $524 million.""We believe the secret to Red Hat's current success is its momentum in winning share of net new workloads (which are increasingly being built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL), no matter if they sit on premise or in the cloud,"" Ader said.""The strong third-quarter results led management to raise revenue and earnings guidance for the year, reinforcing our thesis that the company is well-positioned to benefit from secular trends in both open source software and hybrid cloud technology,"" he wrote.Needham's Zeller agreed.""RHT is still dominated by core RHEL, which is roughly 82% of total subscription revenue, yet growth was strong"" at 18% in constant currency and 12% ""as reported,"" Zeller said in a research note Friday.

367,RHT,"What's the next step for Docker, one of Silicon's Valley's hottest startups?It's not an initial public offering — at least not this year, apparently. The well-funded, lean company says that it's in no rush to go public.While buoyed by success among Internet and cloud computing companies, Docker is still improving its ""container"" software technology. Docker's software makes it easier to develop business apps for cloud computing services. The container approach packages apps for distribution over the Internet.Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and rival cloud services units from Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), among others, have integrated support for Docker's software.""Containers are the darling technology for the cloud, whether it's Google or AWS,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research. ""The idea is like a shipping container. They're all the same size, all the same measurements. You just plug the app in. It's more efficient with less overhead.""Docker's software runs on Linux, an open-source operating system. It's free to software developers, who are key to driving the adoption of emerging technologies. Docker aims to make money from technical support, training, its own cloud-based services and specialized versions of its software.Need To Convince Big UsersAnalysts say that one of Docker's first goals is to make its container software more popular among big companies and other enterprise customers. Cloud computing enables companies to share business resources with customers and suppliers via the Internet. Some large firms have been slow to adopt cloud-based services due to concerns that their data centers could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. One of Docker's challenges is to convince enterprise customers that running cloud-based container software poses no security issues.""The next step for Docker as a company is to add additional security, building out management tools, and storage management — making containers easier to use and easier to manage, like virtual machines are today,"" said Dave Bartoletti, a Forrester Research analyst.Virtualization technology leader VMware (VMW) might have reason to worry over Docker's rise, say some Wall Street analysts. EMC (EMC) spun off VMware in 2007, retaining an 80% stake. VMware's virtualization software is widely used in corporate data centers. The software enables computer servers to run different operating systems and apps, and share workloads.Linux-based containers are virtualization technologies, explains Gartner analyst Lydia Leong. But she says that Docker's app containers are not a replacement for VMware's software.""Docker is especially well-suited to new application development projects,"" Leong said. ""Containers are fast, efficient and lightweight, but they will not replace existing virtualized apps any time soon.""But Docker can help companies build, test and deploy new containerized applications faster, with the freedom to run on a wide range of cloud and (data center) server platforms.""Leong says that companies might stick with VMware-based solutions for security reasons.Getting More AttentionWall Street, though, is keeping an eye on the privately held Docker.""Emerging container technologies could pose a threat to vendors such as VMware and Citrix Systems (CTXS),"" said William Blair analyst Jason Ader in a recent research report. ""Microsoft's statement that it will support Docker containers in its future Windows Server platform release is a major development. Containers offer compelling advantages over virtual machine-based architectures that include faster deployment times.""Backers of OpenStack, a cloud computing software platform with wide support, also plan to support Docker technology. OpenStack supporters position the open-source software as an alternative to VMware.In a research note, Nomura Securities analyst Rick Sherlund called Docker ""a growing competitive threat to VMware."" Yet, Sherlund says, many corporate information technology departments are not ready to deploy container tech.Forrester's Bartoletti says that VMware has a ""bull's-eye"" on its back if it doesn't respond. He says that open-source Linux leader Red Hat (RHT) might, to a lesser extent, also see Docker's popularity raise strategic questions.VMware has paid attention. In December, VMware said that it would integrate Docker tech into its server virtualization software.In September, Docker said that it had raised $40 million from private investors, raising its total venture capital funding to near $65 million, analysts say.Docker isn't the only new player in container technology. One rival is San Francisco-based CoreOS. Gartner's Leong says that Docker is well ahead of other startups.

Shares, though, are 40% extended from a 129.52 buy point, so investors might take at least some profits at this point.Hedberg said Palo Alto Networks sees its approach to end-point security and acceptance of its Traps end-point security subscription offering as differentiated from competitors such as FireEye (FEYE), Bit9, Tainium and others. He also expects the company to capitalize on upselling opportunities for hundreds of customers who purchased security products beginning in 2009 and 2010 and need to update and improve security.Palo Alto Networks last month posted Q3 earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations. It also announced that it had acquired CirroSecure, an acquisition that brings it technology to secure software that's delivered via the Internet as needed by customers. Palo Alto Networks acquired Morta Security and Cyvera last year.The company introduced its new AutoFocus threat-intelligence offering during the quarter, with more than 750 customers submitting requests to enroll in the program.Palo Alto Networks said it added 1,500 customers in Q3, up 41% year over year, bringing the total to more than 24,000.RELATED: 'Elise' Cyber-Espionage Attacks Well-Funded: Report

The rest will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, which it says could include acquisitions or strategic transactions.The company also said it will offer shareholders an additional $105 million in senior notes.Red Hat is the No. 1 provider of Linux-based open-source operating-system software. The company also provides middleware, storage and virtualization products.Last month, the company reported fiscal Q2 earnings, with its billings growth and revenue outlook lagging expectations.Red Hat recently acquired Inktank, a maker of open-source storage systems, for $175 million; eNovance, which makes open-source cloud-computing systems, for $95 million; and FeedHenry, a mobile application platform provider, for $82 million.That flurry likely means that more such deals are not imminent, said Gregg Moskowitz, an analyst for Cowen and Co., in a report Wednesday. He maintained his outperform rating on Red Hat stock.""This transaction will give management additional flexibility to take full advantage of its opportunity in areas such as OpenStack and Platform-as-a-Service,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, we believe Red Hat is in full digestion mode and we don't expect any further M&A in the very near future.""Red Hat stock inched up in morning trading in the stock market today, near 56.50, but it's down 10% since touching a 29-month high of 62.69 in August.

479,RHT,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

But the company is also rapidly moving into other areas including middleware, storage software, virtualization software and cloud computing services.The company competes with Oracle (ORCL) and VMware (VMW), among others.Red Hat stock was up more than 8.5% in morning trading in the stock market today, above 74. Red Hat stock is up 7% this year after jumping 23% last year.The company's ability to move beyond its core Linux business is what is driving its business and growth, Steve Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a research report Thursday. He rates Red Hat stock outperform.""Pace of core infrastructure business (86%) accelerated a bit to 17% year-over-year in constant currency, while new products continued to show increasing traction,"" he wrote. ""Red Hat is successfully evolving from a tactical vendor of a single (powerful) product (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) to a strategic vendor of next-generation open source solutions, OpenStack (on premise Infrastructure-as-a-Service) and OpenShift (on premise Platform-as-a-Service).""RBC Capital Markets increased its price target on Red Hat to 80 from 75. BMO Capital Markets raised its price target to 83 from 77. Northland Securities increased its price target to 80 from 75. It has an outperform rating on the company. Mizuho Securities raised its price target to 85 from 75. All four investment banks have a buy or equivalent rating on Red Hat stock.Red Hat appears to be firing on all cylinders, Gregg Moskowitz, an analyst for Cowen and Co., said in a research report Thursday. He, too, rates the stock outperform.""We continue to believe Red Hat's core business is very healthy and will see a boost from the RHEL 7 product cycle, in part driven by early interest in Linux containers,"" he wrote. ""Middleware also continues to impress and the company's public cloud momentum is clearly rising.""Finally, our checks indicate that OpenStack activity is picking up, and Red Hat's positioning within the OpenStack ecosystem provides investors with potential for significant medium-to-longer-term upside, in our view.""

508,RHT,"The question of whether Red Hat is still a high-growth company remains unanswered even after last month, when it posted fiscal Q2 revenue that rose 19% from the year-earlier quarter — its biggest rise in more than two years.Nevertheless, Red Hat's (RHT) Q3 revenue guidance was lighter than expected, with the company citing foreign currency exchange issues.The No. 1 maker of software and services for the open-source Linux operating system is amid a transition. Red Hat has capitalized on companies switching from the older Unix OS to Linux, but many analysts say that the migration is slowing. In the meantime, the company has expanded into middleware, software storage and virtualization.Red Hat has also jumped into cloud services, forging partnerships with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell, IBM (IBM) and others to build products tied to OpenStack.OpenStack is an open-source cloud software platform with broad industry backing. The software helps companies move operations onto the Internet cloud.The writing is on the wall for the Unix-to-Linux migration, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.""Red Hat is one of these companies that had one big leg of industry growth from a core product like Linux, but that growth is maturing,"" Turits told IBD. ""To re-accelerate, the company will need additional growth from a combination of new products.""New Markets CrucialJ. Derrick Wood, an analyst for the Susquehanna Financial Group, agrees that Red Hat's future depends on moving into other areas.""They are not a mid-20% (quarterly revenue) grower anymore, but they are still a 15% to 20% grower,"" Wood said. ""That reflects moderation in the Unix-to-Linux ramp-up and other opportunities — whether it's OpenStack or storage or a lot of their middleware products — getting more traction.""But it's far from certain that the Unix-to-Linux migration is slowing, Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst told IBD.""It's really hard to know because when we do deals with larger companies — even ones that are using Unix — they are not saying this is Unix-to-Linux,"" he said. ""They are just buying more units, and some of those are Unix-to-Linux, and some are (Microsoft) Windows-to-Linux, and a lot of them are just pure net new workloads.""We rarely have a deal that is just Unix-to-Linux.""Red Hat posted $339.5 million in infrastructure subscription revenue — basically, its Linux business but also a few other revenue sources — for its Q2 ending Aug. 31, up 16% from the year-earlier quarter. But subscription revenue for its middleware and application-related emerging products rose 44%, to $57.5 million.The emerging app-related revenue would be $232 million on an annualized basis, showing that the company is far from stagnant, Whitehurst says.""I don't think there is any other open-source company even half that size in such subscription revenue,"" Whitehurst said, ""so it's a large and rapidly growing business for us.""Red Hat's move into OpenStack will be most crucial in accelerating growth, Turits says.""If you combine (OpenStack) with a broad portfolio of other things they are doing, including JBoss (middleware) applications and virtualization, then it's a very attractive portfolio,"" he said.Red Hat faces competition from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), VMware (VMW) and several privately held companies in the still-young OpenStack market.Differentiation will be the key to growth, Turits says.""They have to face the early stage of fragmentation in the industry where lots of people are offering OpenStack, and they have to figure out how they will bring that to market,"" he said.Red Hat is counting on partnerships with Cisco, Dell, Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK) and others to gain market share in OpenStack.Pairing with hardware companies, particularly with No. 1 network gear maker Cisco, should give Red Hat an edge, Whitehurst says.""Cisco is a big company with a massive go-to-market organization, which we think can help us scale our offerings by rolling out through their distribution channel,"" he said.OpenStack looks like it will be a large opportunity for Red Hat, Whitehurst says, but he adds that investors shouldn't view OpenStack as a needed replacement for a perceived slowing of the Unix-to-Linux migration.""I think people get lost in this whole 'Red Hat is slowing down, OpenStack needs to work' thing,"" he said.

571,RHT,"Chinese professional education services provider Tarena International scored high grades on its first financial report card since going public.Enrollment is up, and Tarena (TEDU) is getting more money per student.The company made its stock market debut April 3 and has risen 31% from its initial public offering price of 9. It is the largest provider of professional information technology education in China, with an 8.3% market share by revenue, says research firm IDC.Tarena's revenue jumped 61% to $24.3 million in the first quarter, topping analyst views for $23.1 million.The strong growth traces to a 30% year-over-year surge in student enrollments to nearly 11,000, more course offerings and higher tuition fees. Average revenue per student rose 24% from a year ago to $2,216.Earnings per share of a penny matched the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters after a 2 cent per-share loss a year earlier. Operating income of $581,000 followed an operating loss of $61,000 a year earlier, and gross margin rose to 64.7% from 60.3%.Classes For A CareerTarena operates in 33 major Chinese cities and had 92 learning centers at the end of last year. Through an education platform that combines live distance instruction from its Beijing headquarters, classroom-based tutoring and online learning modules, it offers courses in nine IT subjects and two non-IT subjects.The company defines the professional education services market in China as non-degree, postsecondary education programs focused on career advancement.Tarena broadcasts lectures live to its learning centers so that each student taking a course has the same teacher, no matter where the student is. The centers are equipped with teaching assistants who act as tutors, says Renaissance Capital analyst Virginia LaSala.LaSala calls Tarena's business model ""capex light.""""They rent these learning centers and don't have to hire teachers (for each center), just assistants,"" she said. ""They open new learning centers very cheaply and expand into different cities while maintaining the quality of their offerings.""Added Credit Suisse analyst Dick Wei in his initiation report on Tarena: ""This hybrid model allows it to expand rapidly without diluting its teaching quality. Its 76 high-quality instructors were able to reach a total of 46,000 students in 2013. The scalability of the distance-education model allows Tarena to penetrate into new markets more efficiently.""Wei says that Tarena is ""riding on strong IT training demand."" ""Tarena is the largest player, with merely 8% market share,"" in what is a fragmented market, he said. ""Companies with solid execution and sufficient capital should continue to gain market share.""Wei forecasts that Tarena will see 29% growth in enrollments in 2015.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings of 46 cents a share, a 59% rise to 73 cents in 2015, then a 37% gain in 2016.Tarena has been growing on a few fronts, including the addition of new curricula. On June 13, it announced cooperation agreements with six universities and colleges in Jiangsu Province to offer joint major programs in software engineering and computer science.Teaming With UniversitiesThe six schools will offer their students options to enroll in joint major programs with Tarena and include Tarena's selected courses in their standard undergraduate curricula. In turn, Tarena will receive the portion of students' tuition attributable to its courses.In another strategic partnership, Tarena announced in May that it inked a pact with online solutions provider Red Hat China to be an authorized Red Hat (RHT) training and certification partner in China.Tarena saw strong enrollment growth in both IT and non-IT courses in the first quarter, said spokeswoman Christina Zhu on the company's May 19 first-quarter conference call.""Our efforts to further diversify our course offerings and revenues by expanding into other high-growth disciplines are also starting to pay off,"" she added.Tarena has more than 100 employer cooperation representatives who work closely with employers, alumni, human resources websites and recruiters to ""maximize job opportunities"" for its students, says a company filing with the SEC. The six-month post-graduation placement rate averaged at 90% between 2011 and 2013, Wei noted.Tarena opened five new learning centers in the first quarter of 2014 and is on track to open about 20 more by the end of 2014, Zhu said.China's professional training market is competitive, Wei said.""Tarena faces intense competition from both brick-and-mortar institutions and emerging online platforms,"" he said. ""Tarena already has the first-mover advantage and also the expertise necessary to operate a combination of online and offline platforms efficiently.

591,RHT,"Hewlett-Packard has stepped up investments in cloud computing, prompting some analysts to speculate that it could make a big move such as acquiring Rackspace Hosting.That, however, would require HP (HPQ) to ratchet up its spending significantly, since Rackspace (RAX) could sell for $6 billion or $7 billion.HP in May said that it plans to spend $1 billion over the next two years to develop cloud products and services. At an annual conference for business customers in Las Vegas this month, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP said that it will expand from two data centers to 25 by the end of 2015. The data centers will be packed with servers and data-storage systems that customers rent via the cloud.HP is playing catch-up to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), in the cloud field known as Infrastructure as a Service. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and IBM (IBM) also are IaaS leaders.As in the case of IBM and other traditional IT suppliers, HP's sales of hardware and software could slow as more companies opt to rent computing technology rather than build new data centers of their own. That's why expanding into IaaS and related cloud products and services is a good move for HP, analysts say. HP stock is up nearly 25% in 2014 as the company is two years into its turnaround plan.Rackspace sells cloud services, including extra customer support and custom tools, as well as self-serve, on-demand IaaS products. The company is a co-developer, with NASA, of the open-source OpenStack cloud operating system.Would acquiring Rackspace, which has a market cap of $5.2 billion, boost HP's cloud strategy? Views are mixed.""It's possible that HP will decide to do something foolish, but I don't think Rackspace is a logical acquisition. Rackspace really hasn't been successful selling OpenStack to the enterprise,"" Lydia Leong, an analyst with market-research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""It would be a $6 billion to $7 billion acquisition.""And if HP were to spend so much on an acquisition, it could get a lot more for that money, Leong says.HP, IBM and Red Hat (RHT) are among companies that have embraced OpenStack, which helps companies connect private data centers to the public cloud.Large companies, though, have been slow to move big computing workloads to OpenStack. Amazon and others, meanwhile, have different cloud software.Some Pluses To Merger""An HP/Rackspace combination could drive favorable top-line synergies by combining Rackspace's strong brand in the cloud/hosting segment with HP's established enterprise sales channels as well as greater momentum in OpenStack, which both companies are actively sponsoring,"" Jonathan Atkin, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a recent research report.""However, Rackspace's lack of a highly automated (cloud) platform compared to earlier hosting/cloud takeout targets could present an additional operating challenge in the eyes of a potential acquirer,"" Atkin wrote.IBM acquired IaaS firm SoftLayer for $2 billion last year after taking a look at Rackspace, analysts say.Last month, San Antonio-based Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options, including a sale or partnership. Rackspace's year-over-year earnings have fallen the past four quarters amid slowing revenue growth.Rackspace has been hurt by severe price cutting in the IaaS market, analysts say. AWS, by far the biggest IaaS company, in particular has been slashing prices.However, Jim Breen, an analyst at William Blair, sees Rackspace's OpenStack as possibly valuable for a potential acquirer.""Rackspace has had difficulty keeping pace with Amazon Web Services and with monetizing OpenStack's nascent popularity,"" Breen said in a research report. ""OpenStack is still in the early innings of paid deployment, and Rackspace lacks the enterprise reach of many of its competitors, namely Red Hat, VMware (VMW), HP and Microsoft.""Because Rackspace operates the largest production deployment of OpenStack and is the second-largest public cloud provider to AWS, it could be a strategic asset to other companies in the OpenStack ecosystem, such as AT&T (T), IBM, EMC (EMC), HP and VMware.""Most OpenStack supporters are pushing a hybrid cloud-computing model, which meshes both private and public infrastructure. Some business apps stay behind a private corporate-security firewall, but companies can access public IaaS providers for on-demand services.Gartner's Leong says that HP has hundreds of its own software engineers already working on OpenStack, one reason why it doesn't need Rackspace.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan says that Rackspace has been augmenting its OpenStack-based platform with more VMware-compatible offerings.Some analysts say that Rackspace's market cap and asking price might put off HP and other possible buyers. Horan speculates that Rackspace might sell in the low to mid $50 per share range.""At around $7 billion, Rackspace would require a significant commitment,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, who has a neutral rating on Rackspace stock.Cisco Systems (CSCO) last month signaled that it is not interested in buying Rackspace.Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded Rackspace on Friday to underperform.""With the stock now trading at an enterprise value of approximately 7.5 times our 2015 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) estimate, we believe the valuation is more than fair for the ongoing cloud business, given the growth profile,"" Kelleher said in a research note.

626,RHT,"Software-defined networking is moving to the big bucks stage.Annual global spending by Internet, telecom and other service providers on SDN systems — where software takes a more prominent role in network management — will soar above $15 billion in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate above 90%, says a new study.The findings by ACG Research, released last month, track above two separate estimates of SDN spending by the other main buyers of the technology, enterprises.The ACG report is good news for companies moving fast into SDN, including VMware (VMW), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), as well as a rising number of startups, says Paul Parker-Johnson, ACG's practice leader.""Cisco, Juniper, VMware and Alcatel Lucent (ALU), and to some degree even Red Hat (RHT) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), may be players, and it's also going to be a mixture of brand-new companies that have made the transition,"" he said.In 2018, ACG says, service provider spending on SDN systems will reach $15.6 billion, up from $626 million last year.No other projections of service provider SDN spending could be found, but two outfits have projectted SDN spending by enterprises.Market tracker IDC pegged annual global SDN spending by enterprise companies at $3.7 billion in 2016, while Pacific Crest Securities forecast $2.2 billion in spending that year. The ACG study has service provider SDN spending in 2016 at $3.9 billion, with a 146% jump forecast for 2017 and another 62.5% rise in 2018.Service providers might be the most demanding market because they answer to a wide range of consumer and business customers, says Parker-Johnson. For them, the need for speed is perpetual.""There is no observable sign that we are decreasing the amount of applications we want to consume — people want their video when they want it and they want their news when they want it,"" he said.IDC analyst Rohit Mehra says the projection is higher than he would have expected. Service providers usually lag enterprises ""in terms of changing infrastructures and technologies,"" he said. ""If you combine the telecom routers and the switches and the optical and the wireless gear globally, $15 billion sounds a little high to me, but it's not out of the ball park.""SDN is billed as providing a more flexible network that can move data faster and more efficiently than before. It requires a combination of hardware and software to be effective, says Parker-Johnson.The vendors pursuing SDN ""are providing really elegant software to enable the applications at the controller level, and so a company like Juniper or Cisco is going to be making money off both the software and the hardware,"" he said.As data and cloud computing explode, service providers need ever faster and more flexible networksAnother challenge for service providers is keeping up with mobile users and apps, Parker-Johnson says. ""It's causing the operators to look for ways to scale up their networks,"" he said.Less Than $1 Billion This YearThe ACG study projects service provider SDN spending at $777 million this year, jumping to $1.67 billion in 2015, $3.9 billion in 2016 and $9.6 billion in 2017.Sales will accelerate as more service providers realize they need to upgrade their hardware to better accommodate SDN software, Parker-Johnson says.""The reason the growth is so steep is that the application providers and the Internet service providers not only want to deliver their applications and use this really cool software that is controlling the infrastructure, they are also going to be buying switches and routers that are being evolved so they can work with SDN,"" he said.Cisco, VMware and Juniper will also be competing with Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) in SDN revenues, says Parker-Johnson. ""You have some international firms from a network infrastructure point of view going hard after SDN and network virtualization for mobile infrastructures,"" he said.Last year, Cisco developed its first SDN hardware and software products and expects to start shipping them soon. Some analysts have said SDN could hurt Cisco, Juniper and other networking hardware makers. Parker-Johnson says the ACG study suggests otherwise.IDC's Mehra says the jury is out until at least 2015. It's too early to expect SDN to become a revenue boon for companies like Cisco and Juniper overnight, he says.""Many customers are still in the process of sorting out what SDN means to them, so there is not necessarily hundreds of millions of dollars in deals that Cisco would get for SDN,"" Mehra said.

636,RHT,"Red Hat (RHT) continues to benefit as more companies migrate from Unix systems to its Linux-based systems. That's the story as the enterprise software firm gets ready to report fiscal second-quarter results after Monday's market close.Red Hat's Linux software products have become a foundation for cloud computing, a system that allows companies to store and access data and applications over the Internet. At the same time, Red Hat is moving into new areas, including software storage, which is also expected to become a major revenue driver for the company in the next few years.For its fiscal Q2, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Red Hat to report a per-share profit, minus items, of 29 cents, same as a year ago. The flat earnings are a reflection of an expected rise in research and development costs as the company moves into new markets such as storage and virtualization software, which allows companies to run multiple software applications on one server.Revenue is expected to reach $322.1 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago period.The company's core business of migrating companies from older Unix-based systems to more cost-effective Linux systems remains strong while new areas such as storage and virtualization software hold promise, Rob Owens, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, said in a Sept. 15 report.""The underlying business remains strong and customer interest is accelerating in incremental opportunities with (virtualization) and (storage) potentially being drivers for the company in the longer term,"" he wrote.In its first quarter, Red Hat's per-share profit of 30 cents was up 25% from the year-ago quarter and beat analyst views by 3 cents. Its revenue of $315 million was up 19% from a year ago and 19% better than what analysts had expected.Red Hat's billings growth was up 16% in Q1. But that wasn't enough for some investors. Shares fell more than 6% on June 21, the day following its earnings release. The stock is up more than 38% this year.For the current quarter, analysts expect Red Hat to produce a per-share profit of 30 cents, 2 cents better than the year-ago period. Revenue is expected to be $340.1 million, up 17.2% from the same period last year.Analysts expect Red Hat will roll out a new version of Linux in December that will integrate its new storage product with its middleware and virtualization software products.Bundling all of the products in one could speed adoption of the storage software, says Trip Chowdhry, an analyst for Global Equities Research.""A key reason why a customer is hesitant to buy more pieces (of software) is because the buying experience is complicated,"" he told IBD. ""If you can simplify the buying experience the adoption gets a little better.""

715,RHT,"For many companies, life in the cloud starts with Red Hat.

716,RHT,"Founded in 1993, the company has become a leading provider of support and related services for the Linux open-source operating system, which companies often use to build cloud computing-based data centers. That's where users store data and apps that they access via the Internet, or the ""cloud.""
"
717,RHT,"Red Hat (RHT) is hot. Year-over-year revenue has jumped by at least 20% in the past seven quarters, while per-share profit minus items has climbed by 37%, 33%, 53% and 47% the past four quarters.
"
718,RHT,"Jim Whitehurst, Red Hat's chief executive, sat down with IBD to explain what impact cloud computing might have in the coming year. While he expects Red Hat to ramp up hiring, the move to the cloud may reduce many companies' staffing needs.
"
719,RHT,"IBD: The move to the cloud is a big trend in technology, but is it resulting in more jobs?
"
720,RHT,"Whitehurst: We will add at least 1,000 new people next year. (The company had 4,100 employees as of Aug. 31.)
"
721,RHT,"So we are growing relatively rapidly. A lot of that is based on the success of our software products in a cloud context.
"
722,RHT,"IBD: Will the booming cloud computing industry help lead the economy out of this slow period?
"
723,RHT,"Whitehurst: Companies are finally starting to see significant productivity gains from technology, so they are able to grow without hiring as many people.
"
724,RHT,"We are hiring, and I'm sure companies like Amazon (AMZN) and others who provide cloud computing are hiring. But I think that is a drop in the bucket relative to the productivity we are providing enterprises, and that again leads to, unfortunately, slower job growth.
"
725,RHT,"IBD: Many companies continue to shy away from the cloud because they don't want their data and apps residing in distant centers. Is the industry solving the security problem?
"
726,RHT,"Whitehurst: I feel very confident that the technologies (to do this) are already in place. There's no question that large centralized data centers can do a better job of physical security and cybersecurity with encryption and security experts on staff. Most of the issues you have with security start off with a human error, and change takes time. There are mistakes in that process. Over time, we will get there.
"
727,RHT,"IBD: Businesses often slow their spending in presidential election years, until the results are in. Do you expect that to happen in 2012?
"
728,RHT,"Whitehurst: No. We are finally starting to see significant productivity gains with information technology.
"
729,RHT,"In the mid-1990s there was no perceivable increase in productivity from IT.
"
730,RHT,"Now we're seeing a lot of it. I think most companies are investing in IT to continue their double-digit earnings growth.
"
731,RHT,"I do think an election cycle would have some impact. But I think companies have a lot of money sitting on the sideline. If people feel comfortable, you'll see continuing investment.
"
732,RHT,"IBD: Cloud vendors count on growth in Europe and other parts of the world that are having economic problems. Can tech keep growing in problem regions?
"
733,RHT,"Whitehurst: If technologies are fundamentally taking costs out, even in a difficult economic environment people will invest. Cloud technologies in general save customers money and therefore I expect it to hold up very well even in very troubled regions.
"
734,RHT,"IBD: What will happen to the U.S. and global economies in 2012?
"
735,RHT,"Whitehurst: You will see modest growth in the 2%-ish range, so nothing we really get excited about but certainly not dipping back toward recession.
"
736,RHT,"Corporate balance sheets are very strong. There's a lot of cash out there. Earnings and earnings momentum have been very strong.
"
737,RHT,"The problem is we still have consumers and governments dramatically overleveraged and that is going to keep us from truly being able to blow out to a superghigh growth rate.
"
738,RHT,"But corporate earnings will continue to remain strong as companies leverage technology for productivity.
"
739,RHT,"IBD: What will be the big tech trends in 2012?
"
740,RHT,"Whitehurst: The big trend is really a paradigm shift in the way technology will be delivered and deployed. We are now finding that small devices are more effective, and that is why you see this thing called (the) cloud.
"
741,RHT,"It's likely that if you bought a washing machine in the last two or three years, it has a microprocessor more powerful than your first computer. In the future, your car's engine will be hooked up to the (wireless) system in your house and it will download the latest updates to see the way your gas is being used based on the weather conditions. Dishwashers and washing machines will also be connected (to the home network). This meganew network explodes the need for computing on the back end, in the cloud.
