0,APC,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (OXY  -  Free Report) Board of Directors announced the company’s regular quarterly dividend of 78 cents per share, which annually stands at $3.12. The figure reflects a 1.3% hike compared with the previous annual rate of $3.08 per share.Details of the Dividend RaiseThe quarterly dividend of 78 cents per share is payable Oct 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Sep 10, 2018. The company has been consistently paying quarterly dividend since 1975.The board members of Occidental Petroleum have been clearing annual dividend hikes for more than a decade now. Notably, yearly payout increases are becoming a steady policy for this Oil and Gas integrated major. The company’s latest move marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend raise.The current annualized dividend yield is 3.7% compared with the S&P 500 average of 1.8%. This rise in distributable income vouches for the company’s strong balance sheet and a constant cash flow position, providing it with financial flexibility and a cushion for incremental dividend.Can Occidental Petroleum Sustain Dividend Increases?Occidental Petroleum's continued focus on the Permian Resources has been beneficial for the company. Permian production grew 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) sequentially to 177,000 boe/d in the first quarter. The output from this region is expected to improve further from the current levels, courtesy of the new wells added to this region in 2018. Occidental Petroleum expects production from this area in the range of 198,000-210,000 boe/d in 2018, which will further boost margins.In the first quarter, capital expenditures were $1,032 million, of which, $574 million were invested in the Permian Resources. A substantial portion of its planned 2018 capex will be directed toward the same to further strengthen its operation in the region.Occidental Petroleum hatched a strategic plan to divest lower-margin, lower-return oil and gas production and replace it with higher-margin, higher-return production from the Permian Resources business.We believe, the company’s strong cash flow, concentration on Permian Resources and organic growth will help generate sufficient funds to meet its financial commitments.Dividend Hikes in the Same SpaceOccidental Petroleum is not the only company to reward its shareholders with increased dividend. There are also other players in the same sector to add shareholder value.For instance, TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) announced the final dividend of 62 cents per share on Jun 1, 2018, bringing the annual dividend to $2.48, registering a 1.2% raise compared with the annual dividend amount paid in the previous year.On Feb 7, 2018, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) approved a quarterly hike in cash dividend of 25 cents per share, payable to shareholders by a staggering 400% compared with the previous quarter’s payout of 5 cents.Also, on Feb 7, 2018, Suncor Energy Inc.’s (SU  -  Free Report) board cleared a 12.5% hike in quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, payable Mar 26, 2018 to shareholders holding scripts as on record date.Price MovementOccidental Petroleum’s stock has surged about 41.4% in the past year compared with Zacks Oil and Gas – Integrated industry’s rally of 24%.Zacks RankOccidental Petroleum currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1,APC,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has received consent from board of directors for increasing share repurchase program for 2018 by 50% to $3 billion from $2 billion. In 2018, the company will have sufficient cash from operations to fund the program along with dividend and capital expenditures.Currently, the company has a total share repurchase authorization of $6 billion. The 2018 share repurchase program expansion to $3 billion along with shares repurchased worth $3 billion during 2016 and 2017, will fully utilize the board’s existing authorization. Therefore, the board has authorized additional share repurchases of $9 billion, taking the total amount to $15 billion.In late 2016, ConocoPhillips had commenced the current share repurchase program. The $15-billion authorization reflects about 20% of the total shares outstanding as of Sep 30, 2016. This comprises shares already repurchased under this program as well as future repurchases based on the current share price.ConocoPhillips also announced that it has reduced debt by $2.1 billion during the second quarter and has attained declared debt target of $15 billion much before the original target date of 2019 end.The board of directors holds the discretionary power to execute the repurchase authorization. The level or rate of activity may be impacted by future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, credit ratings and other considerations that are relevant.These initiatives emphasize the company’s commitment toward boosting shareholders’ value. It also highlights the fact that the company projects upside potential in shares. As the company achieved the target of meeting debt before the targeted date, ConocoPhillips can focus on channeling cash flows toward business growth and maintain efficiency in operations.As oil and gas prices continue to recover, several oil giants have reinitiated share repurchase program, which is intended to increase shareholders’ value. Some of these companies include BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report)Price PerformanceIn the past three months, ConocoPhillips’ shares have gained 8.7% compared with the industry’s rise of 8.5%. Zacks Rank & Another Stock to ConsiderConocoPhillips currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2,APC,"The hottest commodity oil has been on a solid run this year thanks to a tightening oil market and rising global demand. Rounds of news about new supply disruption are adding strength to the oil price, making the case for energy stocks appealing.Supply DecliningThe looming Iran sanctions and falling Libya and Venezuela output were the biggest catalysts in driving oil price lately. The United States is expected to halt oil exports from the fifth-biggest producer Iran by November though some waivers can be granted while production in Libya has halved in five months to 527,000 barrels per day. Venezuela’s worsening economic crisis has forced the country to curtail its output to below 2 million barrels per day, which has been halved since 2005.Now, the strike by hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs has led to the shutdown of one shell-operated oilfield and escalated supply worries. A Canadian production outage at the 360,000-bpd Syncrude oil sands facility has reduced flows into Cushing, OK and is expected to continue doing so till September.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other top crude producers, agreed to raise output by about 1 million barrels per day from July in order to offset global production losses in countries including Libya and Venezuela. However, the move will not be able to make up for higher demand thus pushing the price higher.Demand RisingGlobal demand for oil has been picking up buoyed by improving economic growth since the financial crisis and continued to be strong during the peak summer season.However, demand from China may be curtailed by Trump’s tariff threats. President Donald Trump has threatened to levy new trade tariffs of 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, a move that will intensify trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.Other FactorsOngoing geopolitical tension in the Middle East is also supporting the oil price. Further, the oil futures market is in a state of backwardation, where later-dated contracts are cheaper than near-term contracts. This signals that the oil market is tightening and demand is robust, paving the way for an oil rally. This trend is likely to persist at least in the near term, acting as the biggest catalyst for the commodity.Earnings OptimismPer the latest Earnings Trends report, the energy sector remains the largest contributor to Q2 S&P 500 earnings, having projected more than double the growth from the year-ago level at 138.2%. In fact, full-year earnings are expected to grow 101.7%.Given the barrage of bullish trends, energy stocks are set to explode higher heading into the Q2 earnings season.

3,APC,"Anadarko Petroleum’s (APC  -  Free Report) board of directors has authorized a $1-billion hike in share repurchase program and raised its debt reduction plan by $500 million. The authorization indicates the company’s plan to utilize free cash flow to fund repurchase and repayment of debts.Enhancing Shareholders’ ValueAnadarko Petroleum has been undertaking initiatives to increase the value of shareholders. On Jun 29, 2018, the company completed its previous $3-billion share repurchase authorization. The recent authorization created another coffer of $1 billion for shares to be repurchased before the end of June 2019.On Feb 7, 2018, the board of directors raised quarterly dividend by 400% to 25 cents, which boosted shareholders’ value.Debt Reduction PlanThe current debt/capital ratio of the company is 57.09%, which is higher than the industry average of 35.05%. Anadarko Petroleum had a plan to redeem debts worth $1 billion in the near term. The recent authorization raised the debt reduction program to $1.5 billion.The planned debt reduction will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and lower annual interest expenses, which will have a positive impact on margins.Recovery in Commodity PricesOngoing recovery in commodity prices, high-quality domestic onshore assets and contribution from international assets drove the company’s performance.Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.43 billion, up 27.7% on a year-over-year basis. The improvement in commodity prices and rising oil production will boost the company’s performance and generate surplus funds for share repurchase and debt reduction.Long-Term Plan of Anadarko PetroleumAnadarko Petroleum is gradually shifting to a greater liquid composition in its total production mix.The company’s shift toward higher-value oil has resulted in highest per-barrel margins since 2014.To focus on high-return domestic assets and achieve capital efficiency, the company has been systematically selling non-core properties since 2004.The high-quality domestic onshore assets have started to yield results. The sales volume from Delaware Basin and DJ Basin assets in the first quarter of 2018 rose 70% and 8% year over year, respectively.Anadarko Petroleum is likely to invest nearly 85% of its planned capital expenditure in three U.S. development areas.

5,APC,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company reported a rise in U.S. rig count.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1052 in the week ended Jul 6, up from 1047 in the previous week. This marked an increase after the rig count fell for three consecutive weeks.Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 952.For the week under review, the rise in rig count can be only attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1029, up from 1024. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the prior week’s count. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, same as the count for the week ended Jun 29.   Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 863, up from 858 for the week ended Jun 29, marking an increase after a decline for two weeks in a row.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 763.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 is flat with the week ended Jun 29.Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4% below the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008. Unlike oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is below the year-ago tally of 189.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 55 units, down from the prior week tally of 56. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by six units to 997.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the week ended Jun 29.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States increased primarily due to the addition of three oil rigs in the Williston Basin and one in each of the Eagle Ford and Permian basins.   West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading close to $75-a-barrel psychological mark. As of now, worries of intensifying trade war tensions between the United States and China have gripped the energy market, keeping investors in the dark the direction of commodity prices. Also, the uncertainty of whether the higher oil output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will be able to offset global supply concerns emanating from Venezuela’s supply and Iran’s sanction issues has resulted in crude price volatility. Despites the uncertainties, oil price is trading at a healthy level, making the business scenario favorable for drillers.     Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report).

6,APC,"We issued an updated research report on Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) on Jul 5, 2018. Being the largest publicly-traded energy firm, the company has a lead position in the energy industry owing to size and diversity of asset base, in terms of business mix and geographical footprint. However, the pipeline bottleneck problem is likely to dampen the company’s domestic production.Presently, ExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.ExxonMobil has strong presence in almost every prospective oil and gas producing plays around the world. With this extensive geographical footprint, the company is less exposed to limited domestic production possibilities from pipeline bottleneck problems.Being an integrated energy firm, ExxonMobil’s overall business is least affected by volatility in commodity prices. Large refining and chemical operations are expected to drive bottom line, in case the upstream unit is dampened by low oil and gas prices.Moreover, the abundance of natural gas in the United Sates following the shale revolution will continue to back the chemical business since the company’s petrochemical crackers will benefit from cheaper natural gas feedstocks like ethane instead of naphtha —derived from the costlier crude.However, being a leading producer of non-renewable energy, ExxonMobil is facing investigations by New York and Massachusetts officials over claims of withholding information about potential climate change risks from the public.In the past year, shares of ExxonMobil have gained 2.7% compared with the 21.2% collective rally of the stocks belonging to the industry. Also, ExxonMobil’s current Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA ratio of 10.29 is higher than the five-year median value of 8.29. Hence, the stock has limited upside potential considering that the present ratio is nearing the five-year high of 13.86.Investors should note that we have employed the trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt related to investments in growth projects and EV includes debt for evaluating the company or the industry.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector include Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

7,APC,"Posting its fourth quarterly gain in a row, oil prices ended June 2018 up more than 14% sequentially. The commodity continued its bullish path during the April-June quarter after it got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbing about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018.The first half of the year saw oil benchmark in the United States attain its highest settlement since November 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts, including a series of buoyant weekly EIA crude inventory numbers, worries about tightening global supplies in the midst of strong demand, and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production.What’s encouraging is that the half yearly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into the final six months of 2018 following the futures contracts’ back-to-back yearly increases. To be precise, the commodity rose about 23% in the first six months of 2018 to finish June at $74.15 per barrel.Reasons for Oil's Half-Yearly SurgeSharp Inventory Drawdowns: The U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases have shown multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles, a pointer to a tightening oil market. Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 44 of the last 64 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 416.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Red-Hot Demand: The major factor fueling higher oil prices is the fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its closely watched monthly oil-market report, said that global demand is likely to grow by 1.4 million barrels a day this year as well as in 2019.OPEC Supply Concerns: Oil prices have also been supported by OPEC’s recent plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. In June, OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela. The consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Dwindling Venezuela Output: Fast-falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by more than 40% since 2016. Venezuela currently churns out around 1.4 million barrels per day, the least since the 1950s and much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. Fresh U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will further strangle the Latin American nation’s struggling energy sector.Potential Decline in Iranian Exports: Oil prices have also run up on United States’ refusal to issue any waivers on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 when sanctions are imposed against the Islamic Republic. Last month, President Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and lead to a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.How to Identify the Outperformers?The strong half-yearly rally does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks. Moreover, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.In particular, we have shortlisted five companies that have outperformed oil prices year to date and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

8,APC,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive about the company’s prospects and believe that it is the right time for you to add the stock to portfolio as it is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Evidently, shares of Marathon Oil have increased 81% in the past year, vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively gained about 41%.Let’s take a look into the factors that make this leading upstream player a compelling choice for investors right now.What’s Working in Favor of Marathon Oil?Strategic Portfolio Puts Up a Stellar Show: As most of the drilling activities in the United States are centered in the Permian Basin, the shale play suffers from lack of takeaway capacity and widening differentials. However, with Permian accounting for just about 4% of Marathon Oil’s total production, the company remains largely unaffected by infrastructural bottlenecks and differential issues of the region.Instead, Marathon Oil has accelerated its growth momentum in resource shales like Oklahoma, Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays. These low-cost high-margin shale plays have less traffic than Permian, therefore leading to narrower differentials and higher pipeline capacity.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded production available for sale of 284,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), up from 208,000 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2017. With enhanced completion designs and effective spacing strategies, it has been improving the quality of its assets, and is well positioned to improve production and revenues.In fact, Marathon Oil raised its 2018 production growth guidance for these shale plays to 25-30% from the prior projection of 20-25%. The firm’s strong development inventory will enable visible production growth over the coming years.Divestment Spree Streamlines its Portfolio: Over the past few years, the Texas-based energy explorer inked several deals to sell non-core assets that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan.In August 2015, the company divested its Wilburton, OK assets worth $102 million. In November 2015, Marathon Oil jettisoned Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets for a total price of $205 million. In April 2016, the company inked a deal to divest its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets to Merit Energy for $950 million. Further, in October 2016, the upstream player signed a deal to sell some of its non-core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for $235 million. Additionally, in March 2017, the company exited the high-cost Canadian oil-sands operations for $2.5 billion. This year Marathon offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) for $450 million. Notably, Marathon Oil exited from seven countries since 2013.These strategic sell-offs not only bolstered its portfolio, but also boosted financials. In fact, over the past two years, the company garnered proceeds of around $5 billion from its divestment deals.Healthy Financials Bode Well: Marathon Oil’s balance sheet seems quite strong, with adequate liquidity and manageable leverage of around 31%, which increases financial flexibility and helps it to tap the profitable growth opportunities. Following the divestment of Libyan operations in March 2018, the company had a hefty cash balance of around $1.6 billion. While the company plans to grow its annual production, it has kept its capital expenditure budget for 2018 unchanged with the prior levels and is also gaining from operational efficiencies.Delivering on its commitment, MRO achieved cash flow neutrality last year and is poised for strong free cash flow generation through the end of the decade. Needless to say, with improving FCF generation, we don’t expect management to shy away from resorting to more shareholder-friendly moves including dividend hike and potential buybacks like most peers including Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corporation, among others.Other Favorable ReadingsConsidering the above factors, it should not come as a surprise that Marathon Oil sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) along with a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors should note that the company displays a decent earnings history, having surpassed estimates in each of the last three quarters. What’s more encouraging is the solid estimate revision that the company is witnessing of late. In the past 60 days, eight estimates have moved north, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised upward by 47.5% for the same period. The company expects long-term earnings per share to grow 15.10%, higher than the industry’s growth rate of 12%.Marathon Oil currently has an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio — which is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies as they have large amounts of debt — of 6.87, which is cheaper compared with the industry average of 9.09.In ConclusionMarathon Oil appears to be a solid bet based on strong fundamentals, impressive portfolio/production profile and robust financials, along with healthy share price performance. Hence, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

9,APC,"The U.S. stock markets have been reeling from severe volatility since February primarily owing to inflationary concerns and global trade war fears. In June, trade conflicts escalated to an unprecedented level as countries of European Union and NAFTA treaty also bore the brunt of U.S. tariffs beside China. Additionally, geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and oil price fluctuations also fueled volatility in the Wall Street.Despite the presence of several destabilizing elements in the markets, the S&P 500 – stock markets most closely watched index – is in the positive territory year to date. The benchmark index is up almost 2%, in the first half of 2018.In fact, this stock market barometer - commonly used to gauge broader market movement - has witnessed northbound movement in the last three months. Notably, S&P 500 has gained 0.3%, 2.2% and 0.5% in April, May and June, respectively. At this stage, investment in S&P 500 stocks with favorable Zacks Rank and significant growth potential will be a prudent move.U.S. Economy Remains HealthyThe U.S. economic growth is at its sturdiest since recession. On Jun 13, the Fed raised forecast for 2018 GDP growth from 2.7% in March to 2.8%. The primary catalyst behind these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Strong Labor MarketOn Jun 1, the Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, its lowest in 18 years. The decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened. Moreover, the Fed has reduced 2018 unemployment rate estimate to 3.6% from 3.8% in March.Solid Manufacturing DataOn Jun 2, the Institute for Supply Management reported that the U.S. manufacturing index rose to 60.2% in June from 58.7% in May. The June reading was highest in last four months as well as better than the consensus estimate of 58.4. The manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 12% of the U.S. economy. Notably, readings over 50% indicate more companies are expanding instead of shrinking.Robust Earnings Momentum   Second-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. Total earnings are expected to be up 19% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. It is to be noted that the first quarter witnessed the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 20.2% on 6.3% higher revenues. (Read More: Good Start to Q2 Earnings Season)Our Top PicksSolid macro-economic fundamentals, government’s tax reform and deregulation proposals along with sustained strong earnings performance are major tailwinds for the U.S. economy.

10,APC,"A number of factors are contributing to a rise in global oil prices with WTI crude topping $75/barrel on Tuesday for the first time since 2014. A power outage at a major production facility in Canada, escalating civil unrest in Libya and the enforcement of economic sanctions on Iran all threaten to restrain global supplies at the exact time that the populations of North America and Europe traditionally take to the roads for summer vacations, increasing demand.Although OPEC increased production in June, pumping 32 Billion barrel/day, an increase of 320,000bpd over May, the Canadian outage decreases global output by even more – 360K bpd – and the most affected area of Libya produce more than 700K bpd, the majority of which could be threatened.With U.S. oil stockpiles expected to decline by as much as 3 million barrels this week, there’s no sign of oil price relief in sight and several major investment banks now have short-term oil price targets north of $85/barrel.Three top-ranked producers in areas not affected by the recent supply slump are poised to benefit from rising prices this summer.Permian BasinAnadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) is also a U.S. company engaged in petroleum and natural gas gathering, processing, treating and transportation.  Though it also operates internationally, 86% of Anadarko’s revenues come from the U.S. in Texas, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.Anadarko has recently invested in significant new infrastructure projects and expects to have new Regional Oil Treatment Facilities (ROTFs) online and operational later in 2018.  The company describes this strategy as “capital-efficient growth, while generating free cash flow to drive the return of capital through shares repurchases, increased dividends and debt retirement.”Earnings estimates for Anadarko have grown significantly this year and they are now expected to net $2.54/share in 2018, a 75% increase over the estimate of $1.44/share 90 days ago.  The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The Gulf and AbroadMurphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report) operates a diverse portfolio of onshore and offshore oil exploration and production assets. With facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic, Asia and Australia, the company has the opportunity to fill in for lagging global supply from regions not affected by the recent physical and political issues.After four consecutive earnings beats, MUR has seen earnings estimates rise 68% in the past 90 days from $0.97/share to $1.67/share. Estimates for 2019 have more than doubled in the same period. Murphy Oil is a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM score of “A”.Canada, Australia and AsiaVermillion Energy Inc (VET  -  Free Report) is a Canadian exploration and production company with operations in Western Canada and Europe.Vermillion is expected to nearly double 2017 earning this year with a Zacks Consensus estimate of $0.96/share. 90 days ago, analysts were expecting a loss of $0.59/share but was revised sharply upward in light of the recent oil price rally, earning VET a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy).Vermillion also pays a 6% annual dividend yield.Taking Advantage of Global Supply and Demand IssuesIntelligent investors routinely scan the globe for the opportunities presented by geopolitical events. Owning shares in the producers of petroleum products who are not affected by recent developments in the global markets currently represents one of those opportunities. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

11,APC,"On Jun 26, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Factors of the UpgradeThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $3.83 to $4.11 over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $4.27 from $3.96 over the same time frame. This adds to the company’s already impressive earnings profile. ConocoPhillips has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 226.9%.We expect the company to record earnings growth of 585% and 4% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.In terms of production and proved reserves, ConocoPhillips is the largest exploration and production player in the world. Also, the company’s upstream activities, spread across 17 countries, reflect its diversified operations. Moreover, ConocoPhillips’ focus to increase production from the more profitable unconventional resources through 2020 is expected to boost cashflow.It is to be noted that ConocoPhillips’ first-quarter 2018 production comprised of roughly 50% oil. The ‘oilier’ nature of its volume mix positions it well to benefit from strengthening oil prices.On top of that, ConocoPhillips has strong commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. The oil and gas explorer recently hiked the quarterly dividend payout by 7.5%. The company also boosted its strategic stock repurchase program through 2018 by 33%.All these developments are reflected in ConocoPhillips’ impressive pricing chart. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 56.4%, outperforming the 41.2% collective gain of the stocks belonging to the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report).

12,APC,"Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report) has provided an update that Carl Icahn has increased stake holding in the company from 3.8% to 4.3%.Carl Icahn is boosting its stake in Energen as the activist investor is planning a takeover. In May, Icahn and Keith Meister — the hedge fund manager of Corvex Management — expressed intentions to acquire Energen, which is undervalued as per their estimates. It is to be noted that Corvex, with an 8% stake in Energen, is considered the second-largest stockholder.Energen primarily operates in the Permian Basin, a prolific oil and gas play in the United States. From 2012 to 2017, the company boosted Permian net production to 76.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D) from 30.8 MBOE/D. Energen expects to raise production further to 95.5 MBOE/D in 2018. Higher production expectations amid recovering crude prices should boost the company’s cashflow.The company also has strong cost-control initiatives. For 2018, Energen estimates lease operating expense (LOE) per barrels of oil equivalent between $6.40 and $6.60, lower than $6.61 recorded in 2017. On top of that, the oil and gas explorer’s balance sheet is significantly less debt-laden as compared to the industry. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of Energen is 21.3%, lower than the industry’s 86%. All these developments are reflected in the company’s impressive pricing chart. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 44.3%, outperforming the 19% collective gain of all the stocks belonging to the industry.Headquartered in Birmingham, AL, Energen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, better-ranked players in the energy space include Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report).

14,APC,"We initiated a research report on Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report) on Jun 20. The company’s strong presence in the prospective oil and gas plays in the United States will back its production growth. However, rising operating cost is a concern.Matador currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This implies that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Matador’s upstream operations are mainly concentrated in the Permian Basin, which is among the country’s most prolific oil and gas plays. Since 2011, the company has boosted Permian Acreage drastically. The company’s operation now covers 115,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, up from 6,700 net acres in 2011.The firm is planning to invest 99% of its 2018 capital spending in the range of $600-$660 million, for operations in the Delaware Basin — the sub-basin of the Permian. This is likely to back Matador’s plan of boosting oil production through 2018 by 26% and natural gas production by 19%.  Higher spending for the upstream and midstream operations, especially when the business scenario is favorable, is likely to help Matador to achieve its guidance of 31% higher adjusted operating profit in 2018. Moreover, in the past year, the stock has gained 21%, outperforming the 17.9% cumulative gain of the stocks belonging to the industry.   However, Matador’s free cashflows have been negative over the past few years, in spite of oil and gas prices recovering from multiyear-low marks in 2016. Negative free cashflows over the years have marred the company’s possibility of returning cash to shareholders in the coming quarters.Matador is expecting its total operating cost to increase through 2018 by almost 5%. The rise in cost is mainly supported by the company’s expectation of nearly 22% surge in expenses related to midstream activities. This could hurt the firm’s bottom-line.Also, the company has hedged its projected 1,920,000 barrels of oil for 2018 within the price range of $44.27-$60.29 per barrel. Additional 480,000 barrels of expected crude volumes for 2018 were hedged within the range of $45.00-$63.05 per barrel. Since, crude price is hovering around $65 per barrel, the company is losing money from this hedged position.Stocks to ConsiderProspective players in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corp. (ECR  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corp. (WRD  -  Free Report). While Anadarko carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Eclipse and Wildhorse sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

15,APC,"On Jun 16, Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $1.39 to $1.64 over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $3.05 from $2.47. Moreover, we expect the company to record earnings growth of 160.3% and 86.3% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.    Devon has a strong footprint in oil-rich U.S. resources comprising Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin (the sub-basin of Permian), Rockies and the STACK play. Moreover, the company has exposure to Eastern Alberta’s heavy oil projects. Apart from oil, Devon’s strong exposure to prolific natural gas fields like Barnett Shale will secure the company’s long-term production growth.In fact, from the U.S. resources, the company is expecting oil production to grow from 114 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/D) in 2017 to more than 175 MBbls/D through 2020. A major portion of the output growth is likely to be backed by Delaware and STACK plays. Devon is also planning to lower cash cost per barrel of oil equivalent by 15% from 2017 to 2020.   The overall production growth and strong cost-saving initiatives are likely to help Devon to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 25% in cash flow through 2020. This will lead to $2.5 billion in cumulative free cashflow generation over the same time frame, assuming that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil will continue to trade over $60 per barrel.  All these positive developments indicate the company’s impressive pricing chart. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 31.9%, outperforming the 14.5% cumulative rise of the stocks belonging to the industry.  Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

17,APC,"On Jun 14, Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $2.69 to $3.15 over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $3.56 from $3.08.We expect the upstream energy player to record earnings growth of 517.7% and 13.1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last three quarters, the average positive surprise being 80.5%.Continental Resources has a strong footprint in some of the premier oil and gas producing properties in the United States.

18,APC,"Repsol, S.A. (REPYY  -  Free Report) recently decided to divest its stake in Papua New Guinea gas exploration properties to Singapore-based Balang International Pte. Ltd. The acquirer is part of China Changcheng Natural Gas Power Co. Ltd., which is a major investor in Asia Pacific’s natural gas and power sectors. Notably, Repsol bought the properties from Talisman Energy in 2015.Repsol owns mining rights in nine blocks in the country including five development blocks with 1,303 square kilometers of net surface area and four exploration blocks with 7,418 square kilometers of net surface area. The asset sale includes around 40% of its stake in Elevala/Ketu and Stanley fields in the Western LNG project. The divestment is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2018 but until then, Repsol will keep operating the business.The divestment is in line with the company’s revised strategy, which came recently following its completion of targets way before deadlines. The company divested around €9 billion worth of assets by the end of 2017.The divestment streamlines the company’s portfolio. Moreover, the proceeds from the sales can support Repsol’s plan of investing €15 billion ($17.6 billion) in its operations, in the 2018-2020 time frame. Repsol will employ €8 billion in upstream businesses, which is expected to help the company reach its production goal of 750 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020. The company will invest €4.2 billion in its downstream businesses. Additionally, Repsol intends to invest €2.5 billion in its several energy projects, which will focus on low emission.Price Performance Madrid-based integrated energy company, Repsol has gained 19.6% in the past year compared with 23.1% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Repsol carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

19,APC,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to see 10% to 15% growth in earnings per share in second-quarter 2018, per a presentation by Patrick Schorn at an energy conference held in San Francisco on Jun 12.The company is consistently enhancing capacity in the North American land market, comprising services to hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Of late, customers are seeking to sand delivery and services related production separately. Many oilfield services players fail to be competent enough in both the spaces. Through ownership in sand mines, Schlumberger has the potential to beat other players in standalone sand allocation works. Thus, through both sand allocation and production services, the company has been generating cash flow to its full potential.Per the report, Schlumberger is progressing well with operations off the coast of North America since customers prefer the company’s reliable and most advanced services, especially when the business scenario is challenging.Buoyed by such positives, Schlumberger expects North American revenue growth of 12% to 13% through the second quarter of this year.The situation for the company’s Middle East operations is different as Schlumberger expects revenue growth from these areas to lag expectations. Project delays and challenges faced by the start-up developments in India, Saudi Arabia and Iraq are guiding such downbeat sentiments.Both North America and the Middle East strongly contribute to Schlumberger’s business. The solid backdrop for North American operations more than offset the gloomy Middle East picture which will likely support the company’s second-quarter earnings growth.Based in Houston, TX, Schlumberger is the largest oilfield service player in the world. Over the past year, the company has gained 0.7% versus the 6.2% collective decline of stocks belonging to the industry.Currently, Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

20,APC,"Units of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) have rallied 11.4% year to date, significantly outperforming the 1.6% collective gain of stocks belonging to the industry and the S&P 500’s 4.2%.Enterprise Products, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $63.8 billion. The company’s average volume of units traded in the last three months is around 6.2 million.We expect the company to post earnings growth of 20.5% through 2018. Let's take a look at the factors that are driving this midstream infrastructure provider.Driving FactorsThe partnership’s earnings outlook is backed by positive earnings estimate revision for 2018 and 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has been revised upward from $1.54 per unit to $1.59 over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also been revised to $1.71 from $1.67.A low-risk business model and long-term pipeline contracts will likely support the partnership’s strong earnings outlook. Usually operating on long-term contracts of 15-20 years, the oil and gas infrastructure provider’s distribution growth prospects look bright despite the low yield relative to peers. However, the partnership’s recent decision to slow down distribution payouts might upset investors.   Notably, the integrated midstream energy firm’s businesses are not limited to connecting producers and consumers of hydrocarbons. In fact, unlike many other midstream players, Enterprise Products is expanding its midstream operations to capitalize on the growing feedstock demand in the petrochemical plants of domestic and international markets.One of the main ingredients used for the production of plastic is ethylene. Most of the ethylene crackers around the globe are using ethane to make plastic instead of naphtha. This is because naphtha is produced from expensive crude while ethane is made from a cheaper source — natural gas.Enterprise Products is capitalizing on the business trend through ownership in several NGL fractionation facilities that process streams of mixed NGL to products like ethane, propane and butane.On top of that, more than 93% of Enterprise Products’ debt portfolio carries a fixed interest rate, which reduces threats stemming from a possible rate hike.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

22,APC,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) along with its partners in the Johan Sverdrup field announced that the 22,000-ton topside for the drilling platform was positioned in one lift attempt.Equinor and partners are the first users in the world of this revolutionary technology that enables the installation of big, new topsides in a single lift.  The topside for the Johan Sverdrup drilling platform was shipped from the Aibel yard in Haugesund to Bomlafjorden at Stord. Thereafter, the 22,000-ton steel structure was shifted from the barge to Pioneering Spirit, the world’s biggest heavy-lift vessel, ready to be installed in the jacket at the topside on the Johan Sverdrup field.The installation took only three hours, since initial preparations were completed before. This makes it the quickest ever installation of a large, fully-completed topside. Notably, installation of the second of four platforms in the first development phase of the giant Johan Sverdrup field is complete.This technology is a game changer for the industry. It has resulted in huge savings in the construction and installation phases, in terms of man hours and expenses. Initially, the technology was developed to eradicate scrapped platforms.Till now, big topsides have been designed in a modular shape. There were no crane vessels able to lift more than 12,000 tons in one lift. Allseas‘ Pioneering Spirit vessel, enables entire topsides of about 48,000 tons to be lifted in a single lift.Installation of the last two topside structures in the first phase of the development is expected in the spring of 2019. Pioneering Spirit will be put in contract by the company for the same as well.The use of the Pioneering Spirit has facilitated the Johan Sverdrup partnership to submit a Plan for development and operation (PDO) for Phase 1. The field was commissioned three to six months earlier than expected with other topside installation solutions. Simultaneously, the vessel has also helped in reducing the estimated costs for the PDO by about NOK 1 billion and lowers offshore man hour by one million.The last phase — hook-up and testing —will begin now that the Johan Sverdrup drilling platform is complete and 85% tested. The platform is due to come online in autumn of 2018. The tie-back to the platform of eight wells pre-drilled by the Deepsea Atlantic semi-submersible in 2016 is expected to begin by the end of this year.Subsequently, the drilling platform will begin drilling new wells on the field for the first and second phase of the Johan Sverdrup development. In aggregate, about 48 wells are likely to be drilled.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Equinor’s shares have gained 15% compared with the industry’s 7.7% rise. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksEquinor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC  -  Free Report), China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report) and CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report).

23,APC,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently agreed to acquire a Dutch rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC. The deal is expected to enable Houston, TX-based National Oilwell to expand its equipment-providing business to the upstream companies. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.Per Rystad Energy, an energy consultancy and data-providing firm, GustoMSC’s designs are present in 10% of the jackup fleet and 8% of the floater fleet, both of which are currently active globally. Hence, the acquisition strengthens equipment provider, National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry.

The Oil & Energy Sector registered 75.7% earnings growth and 14.2% revenue growth in the quarter.In this article, we will do a comparative analysis of two prominent Oil & Gas companies —  Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) — to figure which one performed better and is a suitable investment option right now.Earnings & Surprise TrendOccidental Petroleum reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 92 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents by 29.6%. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of 15 cents.ConocoPhillips reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by 29.7%. In the prior-year quarter, the company incurred a loss of 14 cents.GuidanceOccidental Petroleum expects second-quarter production to be in the range of 628,000-648,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). The company expects 2018 production between 645,000 and 665,000 boe/d, up from the prior expected range of 640,000-665,000 boe/d. It expects second-quarter’s Permian Resources production within 188,000-198,000 boe/d. The company anticipates 2018 Permian Resources production in the range of 198,000-210,000 boe/d, up from the prior guidance of 195,000-209,000 boe/d.Occidental Petroleum is executing a strategic initiative by disinvesting in areas with lower-margin, lower-return oil and gas production, to fund the capital requirement in areas with higher-margin, higher-return production, such as the Permian Resources business.  ConocoPhillips provided production guidance in the range of 1,170-1,210 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOED) for second-quarter, 2018.  For the full year, production projection was raised from 1,195-1,235 MBOED to 1,200-1,240 MBOED. The company has plans to acquire stake of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) in the Alpine pipeline. Once the deal is concluded, ConocoPhillips will be able to generate more cashflows from incremental production.Estimate Movement & Surprise TrendIn the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Occidental Petroleum’s earnings for 2018 and 2019 has moved up 26.5% and 36.4%, respectively.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ConocoPhillips’s earnings for 2018 and 2019 has moved up 5.7% and 17.1%, respectively.Occidental Petroleum surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the four trailing quarters with an average surprise of 30.18%. ConocoPhillips topped the consensus estimate in three of the four trailing quarters with an average surprise of 226.9%.Zacks RankOccidental Petroleum currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. It has a market capitalization of around $63.10 billion.ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a market capitalization of $76.6 billion.Price MovementShares of Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips have gained 6.8% and 0.0%, respectively, against the industry’s decline of 2.0% in a month. Post earnings, the price movement of Occidental Petroleum has showed some improvement whereas the ConocoPhillips’s performance was flat over the same period. How the Oil & Gas Industry is Shaping UpAfter the price collapse in 2015, the Oil & Gas industry has seen substantial rise in oil prices in the recent months, which has led to increased oil production in United States, enabling the country to challenge the dominance of Middle-East oil producing countries.U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. crude oil production will average 10.7 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2018, up from 9.4 million b/d in 2017, and will average 11.9 million b/d in 2019, 0.4 million b/d higher than forecast in the April.Also, the United States is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, thanks to the shale revolution.The Oil & Energy Sector is expected to register earnings growth of 124.9% in second-quarter 2018 on the back of revenue growth of 19%. (For more details read our weekly Zacks Earnings Trends)The VerdictBoth Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips surpassed first-quarter earnings expectations but the former has a better earnings surprise trend in the last four quarters.The companies saw upward estimates for 2018 and 2019 in the last 30 days. However, the magnitude of estimate revisions for Occidental Petroleum was better than ConocoPhillips.Given its better rank and magnitude of estimate revisions post earnings, our verdict is tilted toward Occidental Petroleum.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

28,APC,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes reported an increase in rig count in the United States.Rig Count DetailsBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week (ended May 25) compared with the prior week’s 1046. Notably, total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 908.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1036, higher than 1023. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended May 18. The tally for offshore rigs was 19, also in line.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 859, up from 844 for the week ended May 18. Notably, for the first time since the week through Feb 9, the market witnessed such a jump in weekly rig count.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 722. The oil rig count rose 11 times in the last 14 weeks.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 198 is lower than 200 for the week ended May 18. However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 185.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units increased from 61 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by eight units to 993 units.    Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — same as the tally for the week ended May 18.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of 10 oil rigs in the Permian Basin. With this, rigs exploring oil in the region increased for four weeks in a row. It seems that drillers have been gathering in Permian despite the basin suffering from midstream infrastructure bottleneck.The leading crude producers in the world — Saudi Arabia and Russia —  were in talks to boost daily oil production by roughly 1 million barrels, per media reports. This created a panic in the energy market, leading crude prices to fall below $70 a barrel through the week ended May 25.However, the oil drilling market scenario is still favorable in U.S. shale plays. Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report). Anadarko Petroleum sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Comstock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

29,APC,"It can be very difficult to find companies that are both flying under the radar, and still might have potential for gains. Many times, stocks are off investors’ radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high risk tolerance.   One way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven’t seen their share prices move higher lately, but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven’t quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report). This Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 29.5%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock gained only 0.13% over the same time frame.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus | Anadarko Petroleum Corporation QuoteYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward. This year’s expected earnings growth over the prior year is 236.6%, which should ultimately translate into price appreciation.And if this isn’t enough, APC currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance).

30,APC,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) has awarded a contract to Odfjell for the use of the Deepsea Atlantic rig.The contract relates to spudding of six wells that comprises drilling of three production wells each for the Fram and Askeladd licenses. Per the terms, the first rig contract has been inked for Deepsea Atlantic. Odfjell has also received a master framework agreement (MFA). This framework will be used as an example for other future rig contracts on the Norwegian continental shelf.Deepsea Atlantic, a semi-submersible 6th generation mobile drilling rig, is expected to commence operations in January 2019.The value for the six wells contract is projected in the range of $150-200 million. Along with drilling services, the rig owner is in charge of casing running, slop treatment and cuttings handling, remote control vehicle (ROV) as well as fuel management. Initially, the contract is for 18 months that might get extended.Deepsea Atlantic is currently on contract with Equinor and its license partners. The rig, which is likely to be under contract with Equinor for a 10-year classification, will first conclude a drilling program for the Visund and Utgard licenses.First, the three so-called dual multilateral wells on the Fram field will be spud by the rig. The wells will include two branches, which will diverge from the main wellbore. Thereafter, the rig will move to Askeladd to drill three production wells. The logistics bases at Mongstad and Hammerfest will support the operations. The contract with Deepsea Atlantic fortifies the letter of intent announced by Odfjell Drilling on Apr 16, 2018.Fram Vest located in the North Sea came online in 2006. Two years later, the field attained its plateau rate of 50,000 barrels of oil per day and peak production was reached more than a decade ago at over 60,000 barrels of oil per day.The field is estimated to be in production for the next 15 years. Per Equinor, the three wells in the Fram complex could produce 70 million new barrels of oil and gas.Askeladd is not expected to start yielding before 2022. The regulator estimates the field to hold about 31 million barrels of oil.Recently, the company changed its name to Equinor from Statoil as it wanted to remove oil from the name. This is a major move recently taken by many energy players keeping in mind the effect of greenhouse gas emission.Price PerformanceDuring the past three months, Equinor’s shares have gained 10.3% against the industry’s 1.8% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEquinor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Nine Energy Service, Inc (NINE  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC  -  Free Report) and CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report).

35,APC,"Oil price has been enjoying a smooth sail for the past couple of months with Brent hovering near $80 per barrel, the highest since 2014, and U.S. crude trading above $72 per barrel. The rally was driven by several factors that are pointing to a rebalancing of the oil market and infusing optimism among investors.This has pushed the energy stocks higher, making it the best-performing sector so far in the second quarter. In particular, geopolitics and a historic output deal are playing the most important role in driving oil price higher. Below, we have discussed them in detail below:VenezuelaVenezuela is the latest catalyst given the new sanctions by the Trump administration on the OPEC-member, following the second six-year term victory for president Nicolás Maduro that would further curtail oil output in the country. Output in Venezuela has already been halved since 2005 to below 2 million barrels per day due to an economic crisis.Iran Donald Trump finally withdrew from the Obama-era 2015 nuclear deal and has vowed to reimpose powerful economic sanctions against the OPEC nation waivered within the deal as well as introduce new ones. Since Iran is OPEC's third-largest oil producer and exports about 2.5 million barrels a day, renewed sanctions would reduce Iranian oil exports, further tightening global supplies.Historic Output DealThe historic output cut deal, wherein OPEC, Russia and other producers have agreed to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day is paying off. The group started reducing production in last January and is poised to continue throughout 2018. As the group restrains crude output for the second year, oil inventories in the world’s richest nations have now fallen 1 million barrels below the five-year average, the level targeted by OPEC and its partners.Mediocre Demand OutlookAlthough accelerating economic growth across the world has been raising demand for the commodity, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that it is likely to moderate as crude nears $80 per barrel. The agency cuts its forecast for global demand growth to 1.4 million barrels per day for 2018 from the previous estimate of 1.5 million barrels per day.Impressive Zacks RankThe upside to the energy sector is confirmed by a solid Zacks Sector Rank in the top 25% with about 60% of the industries ranking in the top 43%. This suggests continued outperformance in the sector for the coming months.Solid Earnings Energy sector earnings have shown impressive growth of 75.7% in the first quarter, being the largest contributor to earnings growth for the S&P 500. The solid trend is likely to continue into the second quarter with expected earnings growth of 121.1%, representing the highest growth.Top Stocks to BuyIn view of the reasons discussed above, we strongly believe that investors should consider energy stocks. We have highlighted five stocks having a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a VGM Score of A or B:GeoPark Ltd (GPRK  -  Free Report) is an explorer, operator and consolidator of oil and gas. It saw solid earnings estimate revision of 79 cents in two months and has an expected earnings growth rate of 745.16%. GeoPark has a market cap of $959.7 million.

37,APC,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1046 in the week (ended May 18) compared with the prior week’s 1045. Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 901.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1023, marginally higher than 1021. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than three for the week ended May 11. The tally for offshore rigs was, however, recorded at 19 compared with 21.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 844, flat with the week ended May 11. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 720. The oil rig count rose nine times in the last 12 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 200 is higher than 199 for the week ended May 11.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 180.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units increased from 55 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by five units to 985 units.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 17 rigs were oil-directed — lower than the tally of 20 for the week ended May 11.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three land rigs in New Mexico and two in Texas.           West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark owing to concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal. Moreover, there is considerable room for rally in oil prices which could support the persistent ramp up in drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc.

38,APC,"Per Bloomberg, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) are in talks over an asset swap deal. Per the agreement, BP will raise stake in the North Sea Clair field, offshore U.K., in exchange of its assets in Alaska.BP is contemplating to acquire ConocoPhillips’ 24% interest in the Clair field. BP, the operator of the field, already has a holding of 28.6%. In return, ConocoPhillips will acquire some of BP’s assets in Alaska. The companies did not disclose any details.Per BP, Clair is the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon resource in the U.K. continental shelf. Global oil giants including BP are making a shift in their portfolios by divesting their mature North Sea assets and investing in areas where it’s cheaper to produce oil and natural gas. As new players are investing additional capital and introducing new technology, the region is undergoing a revival. BP intends to focus on a few projects as it aims higher output.Per sources, the companies have not reached any final decision and talks regarding the deal may fall apart. The sources were not aware of the exact Alaskan assets that were being auctioned. Among BP’s holdings, Prudhoe Bay is the biggest field. The field commenced production in the 1970s.ConocoPhillips has been consistently trying to focus on the shale in the United States. Evidently, the company increased its exploration activity in Alaska. In 2017, it turned out to be the largest oil producer in the region. In February 2018, the company announced a deal to acquire a stake in Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s (APC  -  Free Report) project on the western North Slope, including an interest in the Alpine pipeline. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips has been lowering its exposure to the U.K., as fields in the region mature. According to an announcement made by ConocoPhillips in April, it proposes to cut 450 jobs in Britain between Oct 1, 2018 and April 2020 as well as close output through its Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal.ConocoPhillips is the operator or has interests in other U.K. fields, including Britannia, Judy and Galleon.Price PerformanceDuring the past three months, BP’s shares have gained 21.9% compared with the industry’s 21% rally. Zacks Rank & Key PickBP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another top-ranked player in the same sector is Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report),  which sports a Zacks Rank #1.

39,APC,"Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) finalized an agreement with EPIC Pipeline, LP (“EPIC”) to transport crude oil from Delaware Basin area to Corpus Christi, TX. Per the contract, the company will start transporting 100 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBbl/d) through EPIC pipelines for a period of 10 years starting from the second half of 2019.  The 730-mile EPIC crude oil pipeline has a total capacity of 590 MBbl/d and will connect the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford area to the Port of Corpus Christi. Along with Nobel Energy, Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) — one of the largest acreage holders in the Permian Basin — has secured oil transportation of 75 MBbl/d.Details of the DealNoble Energy consistently focuses on U.S. onshore operations to strengthen cash flow and margin. The company is planning to invest nearly 70% of its planned 2018 capital expenditures for the development of these assets.Going forward, onshore production is projected to be a major contributor to Noble Energy’s total output. The company focuses on the Delaware Basin and expects higher volumes from this region.Further, the deal will diversify Noble Energy’s onshore marketing outlets with access to global markets at an attractive pipeline transport cost.What Comes Next?Per the deal, Noble Energy has secured options to acquire up to 30% ownership in the EPIC crude pipeline and around 15% ownership in the EPIC NGL pipeline.  The company is require to exercise the options by the first quarter of 2019.Rising production volumes in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford area will increase the importance of EPIC’s pipelines. We believe that acquiring a portion of the pipeline will act as a tailwind for Noble Energy and boost earnings.Price PerformanceShares of Noble Energy have outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have returned 10.7% compared with the industry’s rise of 6.1%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksNoble Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.

40,APC,"The United States has pulled out of the landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear program and reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that it was a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” He added that the “Iran deal is defective at its core” and it’s an “embarrassment” that the United States did little to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambition.In the run-up to the U.S. decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he has evidence that the nuclear deal was nothing but fabrications and Iran was hiding nuclear weapons. Trump agreed that Netanyahu’s claims corroborated his own view.So, what is the Iran nuclear deal? It was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several other world powers including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States to reduce the Islamic Republic’s ability to produce two major components of nuclear weapons — plutonium and uranium. In return, Iran will be able spared of crippling financial sanctions. The deal also permitted Iran to export more crude provided the nation restricted its nuclear activities.Let us now take a look at the potential winners and losers emerging from the end of the Iran nuclear deal:Oil Near $70, Energy Stocks GainWith the United States poised to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sales, oil prices initially dropped but rebounded soon after. This has disrupted global oil production at a time when the crude market is tight. The international benchmark, Brent crude oil, rose as high as 3.1% to $77.20 in early trading in London on May 9, while the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil climbed to $70.93. Shares of energy companies are, undoubtedly, rallying as crude prices hover near $70 a barrel. Energy shares are looking up after they fell out of favor when oil price slipped from $100 a barrel to under $30 in 2014. In fact, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the past month to total gains of 3.1% so far this year.From exploration and production firm Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) to petroleum refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), all have seen a rally in shares of more than 20% to date, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500’s decline of less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, smaller energy equipment and services companies, whose shares tend to rise with an uptick in oil prices, have gained even more.At the same time, companies like Encana Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company’s (PXD  -  Free Report) earnings are poised to improve further as oil prices scale north. This is because these companies have already posted better results in the most recent quarter when oil prices were between $50 and $60 a barrel.As oil continues to hover around $70 a barrel and is probably heading toward $80 soon, these energy players will not only make the most of the higher spot prices but will also hedge into next year at higher oil prices.But let’s admit that it’s just not oil prices that are changing investors’ attitude toward energy companies. Stronger balance sheets, steady rise in profitability and focus to boost shareholders’ returns are shaping the turnaround in the energy space.Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have already seen the best first-quarter performance in years last month. In all, the highest first quarter year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be recorded in the energy sector, which is expected to surge 73.9% from the same period last year on 14.4% higher revenues.Given this bullishness, some of the top-ranked energy shares one could consider are Evolution Petroleum Corporation (EPM  -  Free Report), Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Oasis Midstream Partners LP (OMP  -  Free Report) and Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report). These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).Travel Shares Go Down, Boeing in TroubleThe surge in oil prices incited investors to dump travel and leisure stocks, put off by the prospect of increasing fuel costs for airlines. Travel and leisure stocks dropped as much as 2.1% on May 8.Trump’s announcement to withdraw from what he considers a “defective” Iranian nuclear deal, in the meantime, is expected to heighten tensions in the Middle East region. This doesn’t bode well for The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). The airline manufacturer stands to lose a whopping $20 billion in business with Iran. After all, it has an agreement to sell around 110 planes worth the said amount to Iranian airlines.The U.S. withdrawal also affected Boeing’s French rival Airbus SE, which had a multibillion-dollar sale planned.

45,APC,"The Q1 earnings season is picking pace with 30.8% of the S&P 500 companies having reported results, as of Apr 25. A total of 154 players belonging to the index recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 25.4% on 10.3% higher revenues.This earnings season will likely see strong performances from the Energy sector. Around 16.7% of the S&P 500 energy players have reported results, as of Apr 25. These firms have seen year-over-year earnings growth of 190.9%, with 60% of the companies surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Q1 Oil Price Performance ImpressivePer the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for the month of January, February and March was recorded at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 per barrel and $62.73 per barrel, respectively.Notably, the commodity never crossed the $60 psychological mark in the 2015-2017 period. The production cut extension agreement by the OPEC players through 2018-end primarily supported the rally in crude.Energy Sector to FlourishFor first-quarter 2018, we expect Energy to see year-over-year earnings growth of 61.2% on 15.5% revenue growth. Among the 16 Zacks sectors, Energy will likely outshine others, with Construction expected to be next with 43.4% earnings growth.Energy is expected to be the key driver for S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth.

In terms of total profit, we expect Energy to earn $14.3 billion through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, significantly higher than each of the last four quarters.The crude rally primarily supported the sector as profits of Energy companies largely depend on the commodity’s price.How to Pick the Right Energy Stocks?With a wide array of companies in the Energy sector muddling up the stock picking power, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief.

48,APC,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) recently struck two deals in Alaska. The company divested its Kenai liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report). In another deal, ConocoPhillips acquired stake in Western North Slope of Alaska from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).About the DivestmentConocoPhillips has already closed the divestiture as it transferred Kenai operations to Andeavor on Jan 31, 2018. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed. With the sale of the Kenai assets, ConocoPhillips completed its retreat from the Cook Inlet region.Divestment RationaleConocoPhillips started its search for a company to divest its Kenai LNG plant toward the end of 2016. The divestiture will enable ConocoPhillips to shift its focus to North Slope region operations. Notably, ConocoPhillips is investing in new projects in the North Slope region like GMT-1 and GMT-2, which have bright future. While GMT-1 is in its final construction phase and expected to come online this year, GMT-2 awaits federal approval.Apart from concentrating on more profitable assets, the deal is also expected to strengthen ConocoPhillips' balance sheet and reduce its leverage, which is one of the best in the industry. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had a total debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%.About the AcquisitionConcurrent with its fourth quarter 2017 earnings, ConocoPhillips' announced that  it will buy Anadarko Petroleum's 22% non-operating stake in the Western North Slope of Alaska and its interest in the Alpine pipeline for a cash consideration of $400 million. In 2017, production from these assets was 63 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). The acquisition reflects ConocoPhillips’ optimism on North Slope oil prospects. The company expects the Trans Alaska Pipeline System to carry more new oil in the coming years.Price PerformanceConocoPhillips has gained 15.2% in the last year against the 14.7% fall of its industry.About ConocoPhillipsHouston, TX-based ConocoPhillips is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations and activities in several countries that include the U.S., Canada, the U.K./Norway, China, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Russia and Qatar. The company is involved in exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas worldwide.We also appreciate the company’s initiative to divest non-core assets as the explorer could use the proceeds in the lucrative Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. The proceeds will also help the upstream company lower debt that has accumulated owing to the persistent slump in oil for more than three years.It is to be noted that during 2017, ConocoPhillips generated $16 billion from the asset sale program. However, the company’s 2018 production guidance, which is in the range of 1,195 to 1,235 MBOED is lower than the production of 1,377 MBOED in 2017.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report).  It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

More than half of the capital is targeted for development in the Delaware Basin.The company raised its 2017 total production to 105–116 thousand barrel of oil equivalents per day (MBoe/d) from 103–113 MBoe/d.  Moreover, it raised its 2017 oil production to 57–60 thousand barrels per day (Mbbl/d) from 52–56 Mbbl/d. The company raised its 2017 oil volumes growth expectation to 40% from 30% from 2016 levels.Our ViewWPX Energy's second-quarter performance was better than expected due to strong production from its oil assets and recovery in the commodity prices from the year-ago level. However, a sequential drop in the realized prices of the commodities was noticed, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty in the oil and energy markets.The company continues to work on its strategy of increasing oil production, which is evident from the rising liquid mix in total production. Production from the Delaware Basin increased substantially during the second quarter with the help of assets the company acquired during the first quarter.We believe WPX Energy's exposure in the Delaware, Williston and San Juan basins will enable it to achieve its new goal of 40% higher oil generation in 2017 from 2016 levels.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

53,APC,"Domestic energy explorer Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Aug 3.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache – which counts Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) as its peers – is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported adjusted loss of 8 cents per share, which compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 16 cents. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the last two years.  Apache’s earnings surprise history is disappointing. The company missed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 46.40%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayAs compared to the year-ago quarter, the pricing scenario for both crude and natural gas has improved considerably. This bodes well for Apache as it has been able to sell its output at favorable prices.  However, for second-quarter 2017, Apache expects production in the range of 376–386 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), lower than 460.8 Mboe/d in the year-ago quarter. Hence, lower projected output due to planned maintenance and reduced spending may negatively impact Apache’s earnings. The company’s high leverage is also a concern. As it is, shares of Apache witnessed a decline of around 7% during the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Apache will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +66.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 5 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Apache has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

54,APC,"Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share that compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and year-ago-quarter loss of 79 cents.Revenues of $8,882 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,735 million. The top line also improved from $5,575 million in the year-ago quarter.  Higher realized prices from commodities sold primarily led to the strong Q2 numbers. Production ramp up from numerous key developments also supported the numbers.Exploration and ProductionProduction from continuing operations averaged 1,437 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, as compared with 1,546 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by field decline, which was negated partially by production ramp up from numerous key developments.Price RealizationAverage realized price for oil was $48.16 per barrel, compared with $42.72 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $20.99 a barrel versus $16.55 a year ago. The price of natural gas was $3.83 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.49 in second-quarter 2016.    FinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 billion and debt of $23.5 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 43%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $1.8 billion in cash from operating activities. The company spent $1 billion as capital expenditures and investments and paid dividends worth $331 million.Total ExpenseThe company reported expenses of $13.2 billion in the second quarter, as compared with $7.2 billion in the April-June quarter of 2016.Q2 Share PerformanceThe company’s price chart has shown considerable weakness through the quarter. During the aforesaid period, ConocoPhillips has lost 11.9%, compared with the 16.9% decline of the industry.GuidanceConocoPhillips' third-quarter 2017 production guidance is pegged at the range of 1,170–1,210 MBOED, excluding production from Libya.Weak oil and gas pricing scenario compelled the company to slash 2017 capital budget from the earlier projection of $5 billion to $4.8 billion. It seems that ConocoPhillips is following the likes of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) in this regard.Zacks Rank & Key PickConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked player in the energy sector is TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

56,APC,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with a host of S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of next week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 54 S&P 500 members that combined account for 16.9% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 11.9% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues, with 79.6% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have any results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, quite a few companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By June 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefitting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had very strong year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 276.2% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 14.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 24Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies expected to come up with second-quarter numbers on Monday, Jul 24.One of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell. In the first quarter of 2017, this Houston, TX-headquartered provider of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services beat estimates handily, thanks to improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count.Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an excellent record: it’s been ahead of estimates in each of the last four quarters. And our model indicates that Halliburton is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Halliburton – with an Earnings ESP of +15.79% and Zacks Rank #3 – is powered with the right combination of these two key ingredients. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteHeadquartered in The Woodlands, TX, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) companies of the world – has a bad track of having underperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.Unfortunately, Anadarko is unlikely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -6.67%. (Read more: Will Anadarko Petroleum Miss Earnings Estimates in Q2?)Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Anadarko Petroleum Corporation QuoteLastly, there is specialized service provider Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results after the closing bell. The company provides reservoir management and production enhancement services to the global oil and gas industry.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the company has a modest record, having managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports.Our model does not indicate that Core Labs is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #5 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Core Laboratories N.V.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

57,APC,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Jul 24, 2017. In the prior quarter, the oil and gas company reported a negative earnings surprise of 130.77%. Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company is presently streamlining its operations. It has divested Eagleford and Marcellus assets worth nearly $2.8 billion and is working to improve oil production from its existing assets.Due to the tragic incident in Colorado during the second quarter, Anadarko has shut all its producing vertical wells operating in the regions. These wells will resume operations post necessary inspection, which produced 13,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. So, this unexpected shut down could impact production goals.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Anadarko Petroleum is going to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Anadarko Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of -6.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 32 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 30 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) when combined with its negative ESP, makes positive surprise unlikely this season.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Anadarko Petroleum Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderAnadarko Petroleum does not have the right parameters to come out with earning surprise this season. However, we have a few players in the Zacks categorized Oil &Gas – Exploration & Production – U.S. industry, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +42.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.

58,APC,"It’s earnings time again and investors are back to watching the quarterly releases closely. This time as well, we expect the Energy sector to contribute the maximum to earnings growth for the S&P 500.Our proprietary data shows that through the April to June quarter of 2018, Energy will generate $19.5 billion in earnings, significantly higher than the last four quarters.Overall, the sector seems profitable with sufficient free cashflows to fund growth projects. Since the recovering crude price is constantly backing Energy, it will be wise to include the ‘oilier’ stocks in one’s portfolio.Crude Price Surges in Q2Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices for the month of April, May and June of 2018 was recorded at a respective $66.25 per barrel, $69.98 and $67.87, significantly higher than the year-ago monthly prices of $51.06, $48.48 and $45.18.Notably, the average monthly crude pricing scenario through second-quarter 2018 was the healthiest in three years. Supply concerns emanating from Venezuela and Iran amid robust domestic economy were constantly backing oil prices.Energy Sector to Witness Highest Earnings GrowthHealthy oil price will likely be the prime factor driving the Energy sector in Q2. Among all the Zacks sectors defining the S&P 500, Energy is expected to be the only sector to witness triple digit year-over-year earnings growth of 139.7% in Q2. Importantly, excluding Energy, the S&P 500’s earnings growth in Q2 will likely drop to 15.7% from 19.1%.  It is evident that the recovering oil price, after the commodity hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003 in February 2016, has been acting in favor of Energy. From only $10.2 billion in 2016, the sector’s earnings jumped to $38 billion in 2017. We expect the sector to rake in $76.8 billion through 2018.Five Oil Stocks to BuyThe weekly U.S. field production data of crude by EIA clearly shows rising volumes of oil through second-quarter 2018. The surging crude production amid favorable commodity pricing environment is expected to support oil exploration and production companies in Q2.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist.

60,APC,"Following the release of EIA crude inventory numbers, worries about tightening global supplies and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production, oil prices settled at their highest since 2014 on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery gained $2.23, or 3.2%, to end the day at $72.76 a barrel in electronic trading - the highest since November 2014.Bullish EIA NewsThe federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 9.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 22, following a decrease of 5.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.3 million barrels.Record refinery throughput and booming exports led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 44 of the last 64 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 416.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.OPEC Output Agreement, Venezuela and U.S. Curbs on Iran ExportsApart from the bullish government data, oil prices were also supported by OPEC’s recent plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Last week, OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about one million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela. The consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by more than 40% since 2016. Venezuela currently churns out around 1.4 million barrels per day, the least since the 1950s and much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. Fresh U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will further strangle the Latin American nation’s struggling energy sector.Finally, oil prices were also supported by United States’ refusal to issue any waivers on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 when sanctions are imposed against the country. Last month, President Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Supportive for StocksThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 1.3% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were also oil and oil-related stocks.An Opportunity to Build a Position in EnergyA steady drawdown of U.S. supplies, healthy demand and ongoing OPEC-led production cuts have driven oil prices higher. Crude has been inching its way back up after falling sharply from $100 a barrel in 2014, to a low of $30 in 2016. The robust fundamental backdrop, which we expect to further strengthen over the course of this year, has brought life back into the sector.Oil’s recovery to $70 and above, predictably, has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector while positioning certain producers to thrive. During the three-year downturn, oil companies worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques. With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality.  High Quality E&P Names Leading the WayWhile all crude-focused stocks stand to gain from the oil rally, companies in the exploration and production (E&P) sector are the best placed, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Moreover, the firms boast conservative balance sheets with enough cash on hand and manageable leverage. This provides them ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally. Moreover, driven by operational efficiencies, these entities have been able to reduce unit costs -- an impressive achievement amid the tight realization scenario.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

61,APC,"On Jun 27, U.S. crude price touched their highest level in nearly four years fueled by renewed fear of a global oil shortage in the second half of 2018. Gains were triggered by a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported which revealed that U.S. crude supplies recorded their largest weekly decline so far this year for the week ended Jun 22.The global petroleum market is currently suffering from supply shortage while demand remains very firm. Supply crunch has resulted in a surge in crude oil prices both in the United States as well as international market. Crude price is likely to remain robust in the near-term. At this stage, investment in energy stocks engaged primarily in oil explorations will be a lucrative option.Surge in Oil PricesOn Jun 27, the EIA reported that that U.S. crude supply declined by 9.9 million barrels for the week ended Jun 22. This was the largest weekly decline of U.S. crude supplies so far this year. Per the EIA report, gasoline stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles remained unchanged.Following the news, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $2.23 or 3.2% at $72.76 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was WTI’s highest close since Nov 26, 2014. Brent crude rose $1.31 or 1.7% at $77.62 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. This was its highest finish since May.Global Oil Supply ScarcityThe global demand for petroleum remains very firm. In addition to the short supply of the U.S. crude, some other important issues are also responsible for global oil crunch. Per a recent report by The Wall Street Journal, citing a senior U.S. State Department official, the United States wants all countries to stop importing oil from Iran by Nov 4 or face the risk of U.S. sanctions. Notably, last month, the United States walked out of  the Iran nuclear pact formed in 2015.Moreover, Venezuela is plagued with economic instability, massive debt load, unrest in the workforce and hyperinflation. These factors are likely to take severe toll on the country’s oil production till the end of 2018. Meanwhile, problems have flared up in Libya. Reuters reported that eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar’s forces have handed control of oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (“NOC”) based in the east. However, internationally recognized NOC in Tripoli has dismissed the move as illegal.Meanwhile, on Jun 22, the group comprising of OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries and non-OPEC allies led by Russia decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day. However, Saudi Arabia already signaled that the country is not confident about ramping up oil production rapidly to replace a shortfall.

PVAC hit a new 52-week high of $85.96 in the previous session.

This represents a year-over-year change of 54.16% and 32.35%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPenn Virginia may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for PVAC?

These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well.

Thus, it seems as though PVAC shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Penn Virginia Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Penn Virginia have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Whiting Petroleum (WLL  -  Free Report), Cheniere Energy (LNG  -  Free Report), and Anadarko Petroleum (APC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 15% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PVAC, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

66,APC,"On Jun 22, U.S. crude price scaled record high monthly levels after the group comprising of OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries and non-OPEC allies led by Russia decided to raise production quota. However, the increase was significantly lower than the market’s expectations.Consequently, WTI crude price climbed 4.6%, to settle at $68.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This is the highest price of WTI crude oil in the last one month and its biggest one-day gain since November 2016. At this stage, investment in energy stocks engaged primarily in oil explorations in the United States will be a lucrative option.Decision of OPEC and non-OPEC AlliesOn Jun 22, OPEC and non-OPEC allies led by Russia decided to raise oil production level to around 624,000 barrels a day in order to meet growing demand globally. Notably, in November 2016, the OPEC and non-OPEC allies took a decision to cut production to 1.2 million barrels a day in order to restore global crude oil price.Saudi Arabia and Russia were in favor of elimination of output restrictions even if that means lower oil prices. These two countries want to increase oil supply by 1.5 million-barrels-a-day. However, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Libya and some other OPEC members were in favor of maintaining status quo.Finally, OPEC and non-OPEC allies decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day in order to comply with the original 1.2 million barrels a day production target. This was much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day demanded by Saudi Arabia and Russia, indicating that oil production is likely to remain stable in 2018.Effect on U.S. Energy Sector   Higher oil prices will be major boon for the U.S. oil exploration industry. The U.S. shale production of crude oil is currently going on in full swing. Crude oil production is poised to hit 12 million barrels a day in 2019 making United States the world’s largest crude oil producer.  Although China has imposed tariffs on U.S. crude, strong global demand for oil will enable the United States to seek out a substitute for China which accounts for 20% of U.S. oil exports. Higher oil price and higher volume sales will significantly increase revenues of oil majors.Our Top PicksStrong international demand for crude oil, tight global oil inventories and stabilization of oil production level will boost oil price rally in the near term. Consequently it will be a prudent move to invest in good energy stocks. However, picking winning stocks can be a difficult task.This is where our VGM Score comes in Handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select the winners.

(RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1062 in the week (ended Jun 8) compared with the prior week’s 1060. Notably, total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 927.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher offshore and inland waters operations. The number of offshore rigs totaled 20, marginally higher than 19. Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than two for the week ended Jun 1. The tally for onshore rigs was 1039, in line with prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 862, up from 861 for the week ended Jun 1. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 741. The oil rig count rose 11 times in the last 14 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 198 is higher than 197 for the week ended Jun 1.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 185. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units decreased from 66 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by seven units to 1,001 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 rigs were oil-directed — higher than the tally of 18 for the week ended Jun 1.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three oil rigs in the Permian Basin. In the past six weeks, the number of oil rigs in the Permian Basin increased five times. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to hover around $65-a-barrel psychological mark. This seems favorable for drillers in few U.S. shale plays like Eagle Ford despite the fact that producers are facing labor shortage and low pipeline capacity, especially in the Permian.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

76,APC,"Oil prices surged on Jun 7, as investor concerns prevailed over an impending supply shortage from Iran, gradually declining output from Venezuela and a longer-term picture of tighter supply from OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) and non-OPEC allies led by Russia.Notably, oil prices had plummeted on Jun 6, following the U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) report that domestic crude has registered its lowest finish in almost two months for the week ended Jun 1. Crude oil production touched a new weekly high of 10.8 million barrels a day, which is almost close to making United States the world’s biggest crude oil producer.  Increase in U.S. oil supply may compel OPEC and non-OPEC allies led by Russia to abide by a global pact on cutting oil supplies until the end of 2018. Investors’ fear of global oil shortage helped crude prices recover yesterday. At this stage, investment in energy stocks engaged in oil production, refining and marketing will be a lucrative option.Oil Prices RecoverOn Jun 7, the WTI crude rose $1.22 or 1.9%, to settle at $65.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent futures for August settlement rose $1.96 or 2.6% to end the session at $77.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded $9.29 higher than the WTI.Supply Concerns From Iran and VenezuelaAt present, Venezuela and Iran are the major supply disturbances. Economic instability in Venezuela, its massive debt load, unrest in workforce and hyperinflation will take a severe toll on the country’s oil production till the end of 2018. According to Reuters, the country is embroiled in an oil supply crisis, with a delay of nearly a month in delivering oil to its customers from its main export terminals.However, problems related to Iran started after the United States withdrew from the nuclear pact and announced plans to re-impose oil sanctions on it. The U.S. government also warned about the possibility of secondary sanctions imposed on European companies that continue to deal with Iran. Research firm Commerzbank reported that several European oil companies have announced plans to withdraw from Iran in order to avoid the risk of U.S. sanctions.Our Top PicksStrong international demand for crude oil, a tight global oil inventories and stabilization of oil production level will boost oil price rally in the near term.

78,APC,"Chevron Corporation’s (CVX  -  Free Report) South African asset divestment recently witnessed a new turn of events, as competition among the bidders became intense. China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation or Sinopec (SNP  -  Free Report) and Switzerland-based Glencore Plc (GLNCY  -  Free Report) were in the race to acquire the assets.Earlier, Sinopec won approval from the South African watchdog, Competition Tribunal, which had positioned Sinopec a step closer to victory over Glencore. However, the recent turn of events can change the outcome.The Public Investment Corporation (“PIC”), a quasi-public investment entity of South Africa, has now entered the bidding war, according to reports. The entity is planning to back Glencore in the acquisition, buying 50% stake in the assets. Notably, the assets up for sale include more than 800 Caltex service stations and a 100,000-barrel per day refinery.The Glencore and PIC team is planning on exercising a preemptive right held by the empowerment partner of Chevron, Off the Shelf. Mashudu Ramano is an influential person in charge of the empowerment partnership. Moreover, PIC is responsible for several funds including the government pension fund’s 2 trillion rands. It makes the entity a large empowerment player in the country.Sinopec won the first round in acquiring 75% Chevron stake in the assets for $900 million. With PIC joining Glencore, the next rounds can be enticing for the investors.Notably, the deal with Sinopec went largely in favor of the local government as Ebrahim Patel, the Economic Development Minister, squeezed out several commitments from the Chinese energy giant for the local communities. The commitments included Sinopec investing 6 billion rand in the economy. Now, if a new deal is made with Glencore and its partners, the kind of commitments the local government will receive is yet to be seen.The sell-out from Chevron is in line with its divestment program announced in 2014, as the company is focusing on balancing its global portfolio with long-term business priorities. Moreover, it will help Chevron cut costs and streamline its business models to help it concentrate more on the assets producing higher-margin barrels.Price Performance San Ramon, CA-based Chevron has gained 18.9% in the past year compared with 13.9% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and a Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Chevron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for a better-ranked stocks in the same space like Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

This deal will lower Devon’s consolidated debt by nearly 40% and result in a decline in consolidated general and administrative expenses and interest cost by around $300 million annually, thereby boosting its margins.To Exceed 2020 Vision Target The proceeds from the monetization of the midstream assets combined with that of the non-core E&P assets are already sold, which will enable Devon Energy to exceed its $5 billion divestiture target.The company continues to work on its 2020 Vision, through which it will introduce advance technology to produce high volumes from wells, continue with its cost-saving initiatives and generate peer-leading returns on invested capital for its shareholders.Increase in Share Repurchase ProgramDevon’s board of directors authorized a $3 billion increase in Devon’s previously announced $1 billion share-repurchase program, bringing the total repurchase program to $4 billion. The company is returning proceeds from the transaction to its shareholders. This will further improve the value of its shareholders.The $3 billion increase in authorization extends through Dec 31, 2019 and is subject to closing of the EnLink transaction, which is expected to be carried out in July 2018.Devon utilized $204 million from the earlier share buyback authorization to purchase 6.2 million shares as of Apr 30, 2018. The new authorization will help the company buy back nearly 20% of its total outstanding shares.Devon’s Focus on U.S. Oil ProductionDuring 2018, Devon plans to invest $2.2-$2.4 billion in E&P activities and the overall capital expenditure for the year will be within $2.3-$6.4 billion. With investments in the higher-margin U.S. oil-producing regions like STACK and Delaware Basin, the company expects 2018 oil production to improve from 2017 levels. Given the ongoing improvement in oil prices, the prospects of the company are definitely going to get a boost as a result.Price MovementDevon Energy has returned 31.8% in the past 12 months, outperforming its industry’s rally of 13.5%. Zacks Rank & A Key PickDevon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

81,APC,"Oil prices trickled down on Jun 6, with the U.S. benchmark crude registering its lowest finish in almost two months. The decline in oil prices can be primarily attributed to a surprise increase in weekly U.S. crude oil inventories. Yet, oil has been one of the best performing sectors over the last few months and is poised for growth.Understandably, geopolitical tensions have kept oil prices in focus over the last few weeks, with the United States imposing sanctions on Iraq. Moreover, a deep economic crisis in Venezuela has pushed oil production down, with its ports struggling to ship enough crude.So much so, that crude oil exports from Venezuela are almost a month behind schedule due to a backlog in the country’s ports. That said, oil prices have been rising over the last few months, which makes for a good time to invest in oil stocks.Oil Prices Fall on Climb in Weekly Domestic InventoriesOil prices fell unexpectedly on Jun 6, on reports of a rise in weekly domestic crude inventories. The WTI Crude Oil declined 1.2% to end at $64.73 per barrel, registering its lowest finish in almost two months. Also, the benchmark Brent Crude oil fell 0.7% to settle at $75.36 a barrel.Moreover, the Energy Information Association (EIA) figures reflect a huge jump in U.S. oil production, escalating 2.1 million barrels for the week ended Jun 1. Crude oil production touched a new weekly high of 10.8 million barrels a day, which is almost close to making United States the world’s biggest crude oil producer.  The rise in supply may compel OPEC members to go against plans of increasing production by a million barrels. Crude oil has been performing well over the last few months with the S&P 500 Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) growing 12.1% in the last three months. On a year-to-date basis, the sector has grown 5%.Geopolitical Tensions to Boost Prices?Growing geopolitical tensions have brought crude oil back in focus again. Earlier last month, President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on that country. This immediately led to fears of a rise in oil prices. Imposition of sanctions means Iran could cut down on its oil production thus impacting oil exports. Moreover, United States’ sanctions over Venezuela coupled with that country’s ongoing economic crisis could further impact oil prices. Venezuela is embroiled in an oil supply crisis, with a delay of nearly a month in delivering oil to its customers from its main export terminals. The crisis comes at a time when OPEC is maintaining production controls that it has put in place since last year.Our ChoicesThe recent fall in oil price might just be temporary as data shows a surprise climb in weekly domestic crude inventories. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to invest in crude oil stocks.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) is an oil and natural gas company.

82,APC,"Two of the world’s biggest economies, the United States and China, have been involved in a trade skirmish since March. Both countries have since imposed tit-for-tat import tariffs on each other worth $50 billion. Moreover, delegations from both countries have met on two different occasions but have failed to reach a resolution.Just when trade war fears seemed to be aggravating, China, in a rather surprising move, announced that it was planning to purchase more agricultural and energy products from the United States. This move is largely being seen as China’s efforts to forfend Trump’s multi-billion tariffs on its imports. Whatever be the reason, such developments are poised to boost both the sectors.Investors looking to make the most of such an opportunity should look no further than investing in agricultural and energy stocks from the United States.China’s Offer to Buy $70 Billion Worth of US GoodsDuring talks with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last weekend, China’s Vice Premier Liu He offered to purchase $70 billion worth of U.S. agricultural as well as energy products. Such purchases are aimed at ending rising trade tensions between China and the United States.This development follows a series of multiple talks between delegations of both the countries. On May 21, a deal was reached between the countries wherein China would purchase more of U.S. products but did divulge any details. In return, the United States promised to delay import tariffs worth $50 billion on Chinese products.However, President Trump’s decision to move ahead with the tariff escalated tensions. The administration had pended further discussions with China to reach an even deal. Trump had earlier requested that China should help United States reduce the size of its trade deficit with the Asian country. In the event of China buying up more of U.S. products, the size of this trade imbalance is likely to dwindle.Terms of the PackageThe deal offered by China states that it would increase its purchase of soybeans, corn and other agricultural goods from the United States. Further, it also plans to ramp up its purchase of crude oil and natural gas from America in order to meet its ever-rising demand for energy.China’s He issued an official statement after talks with Ross. He stated that both the countries had “good communication in various areas such as agriculture and energy.” He also stated that further details were “yet to be confirmed by both sides.""4 Hot ChoicesChina’s offer to purchase more of U.S. agricultural and energy products would most certainly reduce U.S.-China trade deficit. This is going to broadly improve fortunes of both sectors.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors.

83,APC,"We issued an updated research report on Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) on Jun 4. The company’s major position in the prolific Haynesville/Bossier Shale play provides a highly visible and cost-effective production growth profile. However, the stock’s low liquidity and high leverage are matters of concern.Comstock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Shares of Comstock have gained more than 55% over the past year, easily outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas U.S. E&P industry's 12.5% increase.The company continues to deliver strong results under the Haynesville program. Production has increased substantially, while drilling costs have declined, resulting in improved margins.In fact, based on the quality of its Haynesville/Bossier assets, Comstock expects natural gas production this year to average 250 million to 270 million cubic feet per day, reflecting a significant increase from 201 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Further, a 27% jump in proved reserves is set to support drilling activities this year.Driven by its operational efficiencies, Comstock was able to reduce operating costs per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) to 70 cents in first-quarter 2018, down from $1.48 in 2014 and $1.10 in 2016.However, with natural gas prices trading below $3 per MMBtu and Comstock being one of the most gas-weighted upstream players, the company's earnings and revenues are expected to remain under pressure.Moreover, we are worried about Comstock's high debt load. The company currently has $1.1 billion in long-term debt, rising 2% through first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with just $51 million in cash and cash equivalents, Comstock's liquidity position is weak.Stocks to ConsiderProspective players in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corp. (ECR  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corp. (WRD  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

87,APC,"Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has carried out a natural gas sales agreement with a unit of Houston, TX-based energy infrastructure company, Kinder Morgan, Inc.

The gathering system is located in Loving County, TX.The deal with Kinder Morgan’s unit is expected to give Matador a flow assurance, as it lifts the company’s natural gas takeaway position from its prolific Delaware Basin assets.

89,APC,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE), a GE company, reported an increase in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1060 in the week (ended Jun 1) compared with the prior week’s 1059. Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 916.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1039, marginally higher than 1036. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the count for the week ended May 25.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, however, came lower than four for the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 861, up from 859 for the week ended May 25. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 733. The oil rig count rose 10 times in the last 12 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 197 is lower than 198 for the week ended May 25. However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 182.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units remained in line with the prior week. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by an unit to 994 units.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended May 25.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three oil rigs in Cana Woodford and two in Eagle Ford. In the Cana Woodford, oil rigs have been increasing for four weeks in a row. Eagle Ford has also been witnessing the same over the past two weeks.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently fell marginally below the $65-a-barrel psychological mark as there are possibilities that Saudi Arabia and Russia will decide to relax the production cut quota in the OPEC meeting. However, considering the current crude pricing scenario, there is room for ramping up oil and gas drilling activities. Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

However, the figure is 16.4% above the previous quarter’s result.Additionally, the company’s Marcellus program is ramping up with exceptional results. The company has around 200,000 net acres in the prime Marcellus acreage with an estimated 3,000 remaining undrilled locations. This high-quality asset base in the prolific region can benefit it in its first quarter operations.What Does Our Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot Oil & Gas is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cabot Oil & Gas has an ESP of -6.23% as the Most Accurate estimate of 25 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. The figure represents the percentage difference between the two above-mentioned estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot Oil & Gas carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as only a positive ESP increases the confidence about an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies from the energy space, which per our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around.Frisco, TX-based Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +37.34%.

92,APC,"Transocean Limited (RIG  -  Free Report) — an offshore contract drilling service provider — is set to release first-quarter 2018 financial results after the closing bell on Apr 30.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.11%. Transocean has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 180.90%. Investors should also note that Transocean hasn’t missed earnings estimates since 2013.Transocean Ltd. Price and Consensus  Transocean Ltd. Price and Consensus | Transocean Ltd. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence the QuarterPer EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The recovering commodity market calls for higher investments from oil majors, translating into more contracts from drilling giants like Transocean.The acquisition of Norwegian contractor, Songa Offshore has boosted the backlog and sales of Transocean, and enhanced its long-term opportunities in the Norwegian markets. Transocean’s strong backlog, which stands at $12.5 billion, reflects steady demand from its customers. It enables Transocean to navigate the current uncertain environment, better than many of its peers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for contract drilling revenues is pegged at $602 million, above $589 million recorded in the last reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from the Harsh Environment Floaters is $193 million, higher than the prior-year quarter’s figure of $122 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from Midwater Floaters is $18 million, higher than the year-ago quarter’s $13 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deepwater Floaters is pegged at $36.30 million, compared with $35 million reported in the year-ago period.We also appreciate Transocean's aggressive cost-reduction programs, which will enable it to shore up its operational performance. The company’s total operating expenses in 2017 declined 26% to stand at $1,388 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Transocean is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +2.64%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

On the other hand, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationTransocean is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season.

However, the estimate of $1.43 reflects year-over-year growth of 1.4%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $38,737. for the first quarter, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayPer EIA data, crude oil rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to end the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark to attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The upstream segment of Shell is likely to benefit from higher crude price realizations.The upstream segment of Chevron is also expected to realize the benefits of higher production volumes on the back of major capital projects including Gorgon, and core developments in the Gulf of Mexico and Permian Basin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter’s total international output is 2,143 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), compared with $2,004 MBOE/d in the prior-year quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly U.S. output is also pegged higher at 693 MBOE/d, compared with the year-ago output of 672 MBOE/d. As such, income from the upstream segment for the to-be-reported quarter is estimated to be $2,593 million compared with $1,517 million in the prior-year quarter.However, the downstream segment is likely to bear the brunt of lower refinery input per day. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total refinery input is estimated to decline to $1,633 thousand barrels per day(Mbbl/d) in the quarter under review compared with $1,665 Mbbl/d in the year-ago quarter. As such, according to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the segmental income is expected to deteriorate to $865 million versus $926 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Chevron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

103,APC,"It was a week where oil prices settled under $60 a barrel for the first time this year and natural gas logged its lowest closing since February 2017.On the news front, energy biggies TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices. Moreover, all the companies awarded shareholders with dividend increases.Overall, it was another dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 9.6% to close at $59.20 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived 9.2% to $2.584 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon & Chevron's Q4 Earnings Miss, Shell Reports Strong Numbers)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its third decrease in four weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a third straight week – this time by 26, the most in more than a year – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-average decrease in supplies. The 119 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was less than last year’s drop of 142 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 151 Bcf for the reported week. Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings of $1.10 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 3.8%.

Higher contribution from Exploration & Production and Gas, Renewable & Power segments boosted operating income.

Net debt-to-equity ratio was 13.8% at the end of the quarter, down from 27.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2016. Coupled with strong cash flows, TOTAL has decided to lift its dividend by 10% over the next three years, while planning to repurchase about $5 billion in shares.TOTAL’s upstream production is expected to increase 6% in 2018, in sync with its objective to grow 5% per year on average between 2016 and 2020.

104,APC,"With a host of S&P 500 members expected to release results by the end of this week, we are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season.Picture So FarAround 251 S&P 500 members, representing 50.2% of the index's total market capitalization, have released fourth-quarter results. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues, with 80.5% positive earnings surprises and 78.1% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, total earnings for the companies in the Energy sector are up 146% year on 23.1% higher revenues. However, quite a few companies are scheduled to post earnings in the upcoming days and events are shaping up favorably for their reports.Energy: 2017 RecapIn 2017, Energy was the strongest S&P sector. In November 2017, the historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut was able to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity witnessed a stellar run on optimism around the agreement and improving outlook for oil stocks.We would like to remind investors that the Oil/Energy sector displayed considerable upside potential in fourth-quarter 2017 after a prolonged period of weakness. The improvement in the sector’s performance drove the aggregate growth for the S&P 500 index. In fact, the most important feature of this earnings season seems to be the positive revenue momentum, in terms of growth as well as beats.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices have trended in the fourth quarter of 2017.Strong Q4 Earnings Growth PredictionA look at the fourth-quarter earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector are spectacular, which boosted the S&P 500 index’s aggregate growth.The October-December 2017 period turned out to be rather good with oil and natural gas prices benefitting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago quarter.For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total earnings witnessed strong year-over-year dollar growth on 23.1% higher revenues.Notably, oil and gas prices during the quarter supported growth. Prices of oil at the end of the quarter improved, amid persistent decline in domestic inventories and improvement of supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil price at the end of the fourth quarter was $57.88 per barrel, up about 2.2% sequentially and 11.4% year over year. A year ago, crude prices were around $51.97 per barrel.The picture looks rather encouraging for first-quarter fiscal 2018 as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second and fourth quarters of 2016, when energy companies reported unusually low bottom line.Energy Stocks Reporting on Feb 6Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based upstream player Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is slated to report results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 60% on improved drilling program and higher price realizations. In the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive earnings surprise was 67.6%.Pioneer Natural is expected to maintain its earnings streak in the fourth quarter of 2017 as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.48% and a Zacks Rank #1.

108,APC,"Sunoco LP (SUN  -  Free Report) announced the divestment of its convenience stores to 7-Eleven, Inc. The transaction, valued at $3.2 billion, includes a 15-year take-or-pay fuel supply agreement under which the partnership has agreed to supply 2.0 billion gallons of fuel annually and 0.5 billion gallons in future as well. Notably, the partnership had made an announcement regarding the divestiture in April 2017.The gains from the transaction are anticipated to be used toward achieving the partnership’s targeted leverage and coverage goals.Why is Sunoco Divesting?Currently, the partnership is trying to make a progress by transforming itself. This, it intends to fulfill by divesting its operated stores. The transformation process is being supported by its efforts to exit from retail company operations.The proceeds from these transactions along with long-term supply agreements will allow the partnership to meet coverage and leverage ratio goals of 1.1 times and 4.5-4.75 times, respectively. Notably, the company decreased leverage ratio to 5.59 times at the end of the third quarter from previous levels.This strategic divestiture is a major step in transforming Sunoco LP into a more stable income master limited partnership. The divestiture transaction is a testament of the partnership’s focus on strengthening and expanding its fuel distribution and logistics segments.Further, the partnership’s performance was impaired due to the occurrence of two major hurricanes that hampered its operations during the third quarter.

110,APC,"Oil major ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently made its first move against the lawsuits filed against it by California local governments.  San Francisco, Oakland, San Mateo County and four other local governments in California had alleged last year that the activities of ExxonMobil and other oil companies led to climate change and posed threats to their regions.Local Governments’ ViewsAlong with other casualties the Oakland government believes the sea level will rise 66 inches by 2100 due to climate change. The San Mateo County fears there is 93% chance that it will face a devastating flood in the next 30 years due to the same reason. The San Francisco government blamed climate change for the floods in its low-lying areas.ExxonMobil’s ViewPer the company, the officials had engaged in power abuse by using government investigation and legal action to put pressure on oil producers. ExxonMobil's court filing in Tarrant County, TX includes seeking permission for questioning and gathering reports from the government officials who sued the company for billions.ExxonMobil, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), further argued that the city governments in question said in the municipal bond offerings that the risks regarding climate changes are unpredictable, which contradicts their allegation. This gave the oil giant the scope to accuse the municipalities of committing fraud.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The other oil companies sued by the governments include Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), BP plc. (BP  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and others.Notably, The New York City government filed a similar lawsuit this week against several oil majors, which includes ExxonMobil, claiming that that the oil companies together are responsible for producing 11% of the global-warming gases over the years.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm. The company has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base, both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint. With a stable cash position, the integrated energy player’s balance sheet is one of the best in the industry, reflecting declining debt load over the first nine months of 2017.We appreciate ExxonMobil’s plans to combine its refining & marketing businesses as this will allow the company to take better decisions and boost performance. ExxonMobil will generate more cashflow from downstream activities, also helping it counter the volatility in its upstream business.Price PerformanceExxonMobil has lost 0.8% of its value in the last year against the 10.7% rise witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

112,APC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015 on strong refining demand.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3-6% (or 38 cents) to end at $62.01 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the seventh consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 3.9% and 6%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels for the week ending Dec 29, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 5.7 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 28,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – just 9,000 barrels per day short of last month’s record levels.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 2.4 million barrels to 49 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.9 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eighth straight week on weak demand. The 4.8 million barrels addition – more than double the polled number of 2 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 233.2 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1% below the year-earlier level and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) soared 8.9 million barrels last week, dwarfing analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels increase in supply level. The massive weekly rise could be attributed to higher output and tepid demand. But at 138.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 14.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest since 2005. The operators kept processing large volumes of crude into products to circumvent year-end tax payments on stocks.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Occidental Petroleum Corp.

113,APC,"In 2017, oil prices recovered significantly. Posting its second annual gain in a row, the commodity closed 2017 up more than 12%. The U.S. oil benchmark ended the year at $60.42 per barrel -- its highest closing since June 2015.However, this wasn’t reflected in the budgeted exploration spending in 2018. The companies are still allocating capital on existing assets and ongoing developments. Oil giants like Anadarko Petroleum and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) have announced exploration budget for 2018, which is lower or almost in line with 2017 figures.For 2018, Anadarko Petroleum announced exploration budget of $350 million, down more than 50% from $770 million in 2017. Chevron’s exploration funding is estimated at $1.1 billion, almost at par with $1 billion in 2017. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The companies are not likely to initiate exploration activities unless they generate larger cash flows with higher oil prices. Only a sustainable rate of above $60 per barrel and robust results of drilling will drive exploration spending in new offshore deepwater frontiers. On the other hand, if the oil prices decline, the companies’ cash flow will be dented. This will compel them to cut exploration budget and defer exploration drilling plans in 2018.Looking Back at 2017In 2017, most of the exploration and production (E&P) companies were struggling to cope with the bumpy oil market ride. While oil prices continue to head higher, they are way off the triple-digit territories of 2014 as prices crashed due to oversupply, the number of finds declined along with the companies’ spending budget.Per oil-and-gas consultancy Rystad Energy, oil discoveries in 2017 totaled approximately 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), whichwas the lowest since the 1940s. Yes, a few more discoveries will be reported later through annual reports but the amount is not expected to increase the total by more than10%.Some Important StatisticsRystad analysis has also found that explorers are finding fewer resources per field. In 2017, an average offshore discovery held about 100 million boe, down from 150 million boe in 2012.In 2006, the so-called reserve replacement ratio – the quantity of proved reserves added to a company's reserve base in a year relative to the amount of oil and gas production – reached 100%. Consequently, it fell to 11% in 2017 from 50% in 2012. It was also reported that the volume of resources per discovered field plunged in 2017.Though the alarming figures indicate toward the depletion of oil reserves, it is also known that major oil producers have emergency reserves. There is a time lag between when an oil firm makes a large discovery and when it's brought online.It should be also considered that low resources per discovered field influence feasibility. Under the current base price scenario, it is estimated that more than1 billion boe discovered during 2017 might never be developed. New Finds to Watch Out For in 2018Guyana – After having spud the Liza discovery in the Stabroek Block in 2016, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) started the year with the drilling of the Payara-1 well discovery, following up about six months later with news of more oil discovered at Payara. In the meanwhile, the company hit oil for the third time in the block— Snoek.  In October, another discovery —Turbot — brought the total gross recoverable resources on the block to an estimated 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent (Bboe).Currently, ExxonMobil is drilling the latest well offshore Guyana in the Stabroek Block — Ranger-1 — and plans to continue operations in 2018 in the multiple leads already identified. The company has made five discoveries offshore Guyana in the same Stabroek Block.In 2018, two other blocks in Guyana anticipated to be spud are the Tullow-operated Orinduik Block and the Repsol-operated Kanuku Block. In September 2017, 3-D survey acquisition was completed in Orinduik, while Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report) inked an option agreement with Eco Atlantic to obtain a 25% working interests of the block. In 2017, 3-D survey acquisition was also concluded in the Kanuku Block. Kanuku is seen as a good prospect for medium-sized discoveries by Repsol.Brazil – More activity is expected offshore Brazil, which is another area which will witness activity in 2018.Subject to securing regulatory permits, work on Total’s Foz do Amazonas (Mouth of the Amazon) well, is also expected to progress. In 2017, an application to drill was rejected by the environmental regulator Ibama citing lack of information. Per the environmentalists and scientists, the well is in close proximity to the Amazon reef. Moreover, good prospects are anticipated from Espirito Santo basin, which is likely to be drilled by Petrobras.Mexico – Several companies like Pemex, Total and Talos Energy are thronging this region. Mexico state-run Pemex is looking at the Yaxxtaab-1 wild cat in the shallow waters of the Campeche Basin, offshore Mexico. It is known to be the first pre-salt well offshore Mexico. The company is known for to having made the biggest onshore oil find 15 years back when the Ixachi well struck oil in Veracruz. Initially, the volumes were estimated at about 1.5 Bboe. Total intends to develop a wildcat in the Perdido Fold Belt.Moreover, Talos Energy and partners Sierra Oil and Gas and Premier Oil also struck an estimated 2 billion barrels of light oil in shallow water offshore Mexico with Zama-1 well.Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) also raised resource estimates of the Amoca Field to 1 Bboe in place and the Area 1 estimated resource base to 1.3 billion barrels of oil in place.Aruba – a wild cat well is proposed to be drilled by Repsol off this small Caribbean Island.Namibia – In September, Tullow Oil is planning to initiate drilling on the Cormorant prospect in the Walvis Basin, offshore Namibia. While it would not be the largest well, a discovery in Namibia is considered important.Senegal – BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) will commence drilling in the Requin-Tigre (Tiger Shark) well, with Kosmos, outboard of the Tortue discovery. The find is estimated to have a potential of 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf).South Africa – Total is to start drilling a wild cat well offshore South Africa using the Deep sea Stavanger.West Africa’s Mauritania and Senegal – The region is largely unexplored. It was only after Cairn Energy and Kosmos Energy, which made huge discoveries, that oil majors like BP, ExxonMobil and others were attracted to this region. In 2016, BP partnered with Kosmos Energy in Senegal. ExxonMobil is about to ink a deal to explore oil and gas offshore Mauritania. Total bought new deepwater acreages in Mauritania in 2017. Tullow and Kosmos Energy have been present in the area for long.  The region is likely to witness active exploration and drilling in 2018.Gambia – In late 2018, FAR intends to drill the Samo prospect. It is believed that the properties of Samoare similar to the SNE field, in Senegal. It will be the only exploration well to be drilled offshore the Gambia since the Jammah-1 well was drilled in 1979.Morocco – Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, Eni intends to drill the Rabat Deep Offshore license offshore Morocco using the Saipem 12,000 drillship.Nova Scotia – Beginning in the spring of 2018, BP proposes to drill a single exploration well, in the Scotia Basin, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada. BP will use the semisubmersible West Aquarius to drill the prospect, which is estimated to take 120 days.Norway – In 2017, Statoil ASA  drilling of the Korpfjell prospect was unsuccessful. The company plans to test another reservoir in the same prospect during 2018. Other players like Aker BP and Lundin are also active in Barents Sea offshore Norway but the drilling results were very unsatisfactory in 2017. The companies propose to carry on exploration in 2018.Suriname – In 2017, the region saw active exploration drilling but the companies like Tullow and Apache (APA  -  Free Report) did not attain any success yet. Kosmos Energy owns two blocks — 42 and 45 — in Suriname and proposes to drill two prospects. Apache intends to drill another exploration Block 58, where a 3-D survey was done earlier this year.In 2017, ExxonMobil and Statoil purchased Block 59 and Block 60, respectively. In Suriname, ExxonMobil plans to start initial exploration activities.Eastern Mediterranean Sea — Encouraged by the big Zohr gas discovery in the Mediterranean Sea offshore Egypt, Eni and other oil companies are expected to continue to drill for the next big find in the area, especially offshore Egypt and Cyprus. In Cyprus, Total and Eni plan to drill in Block 6 in 2018, and QP and ExxonMobil plan to drill in Block 10 in 2018.Other areas include Montenegro, Cyprus and Portugal, where Eni is planning to drill. Total is also reviewing Papua New Guinea.In March, Repsol and partner Armstrong Energy encountered a massive oil find in the Nanushuk Play, located in Alaska’s North Slope. The companies claimed that the discovery was the biggest U.S. onshore conventional hydrocarbons discovery in three decades with 1.2 billion barrels of recoverable light oil.Bottom LineWith so many prospects lined up for drilling, we believe oil supply will remain unharmed going forward. But the companies spending will largely impact the outcome, which again will depend on the sustainable oil rate of above $60 per barrel.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Moreover, the company plans to invest approximately $1.1 billion in Deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations, $0.55 billion in Midstream, $0.35 billion in Exploration and LNG and $0.15 billion in International Operations.Moreover, Anadarko Petroleum will allocate approximately $900 million in upstream activities in the Delaware Basin of West Texas, along with another $500 million midstream investment.

(DNR  -  Free Report), Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report).Price MovementAnadarko Petroleum has underperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have lost 14% compared with the industry’s decline of 16.3%.The underperformance can be attributed to the increasing dry hole expenses that the company has been incurring in past few months, which in turn is affecting its margins.Zacks RankAnadarko Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

123,APC,"The third-quarter earnings season passed the half way mark last week. Total earnings for the 272 S&P members, that have already released results, are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.  This is going to be another busy week with 900 companies expected to release earnings including 134 members of the S&P 500. Combining the results of the 272 S&P 500 members with the index’s 228 members yet to report, we expect total earnings to be up 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this positive backdrop let us focus on Zacks Oil and Energy Sector this earnings season. Earnings from this sector are expected to be up 148.2% from the same period last year on 19.7% higher revenues.

Oil price at the end of third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, reflecting a sequential improvement of 10.5%. Oil prices also improved on a year-over-year basis.Few oil and gas companies had to cope with the impact of hurricanes that disrupted operation during the quarter.

124,APC,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Oct 31. In the prior quarter, the oil and gas company reported a negative earnings surprise of 126.47%. Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcementFactors to ConsiderAnadarko Petroleum reaffirmed production guidance range for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM), DJ and Delaware basin assets. In GOM and Delaware and DJ basins, the company expects average production rates to be 130,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 150,000 BOPD respectively for full-year 2017.During the second quarter, the U.S. operations have been the major contributor in both Oil and Natural gas production. We can expect the same in the current quarter as well. The company's high quality assets and infrastructure will help it to come out with strong performance, despite challenges caused by Hurricane Harvey.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales volume stands at 59 million barrels of oilequivalent (MMBOE) for third quarter that is within the company’s guidance range of 58-60 MMBOE.Similarly the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total average daily volumes is currently pegged at 643,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day(BOE/d)and has exceeded the announced guidance range of 630,000-652,000 BOE/d.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus estimate for total average daily volumes in the United Statesfor natural gas for the current quarter is pegged at 1,122 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d),marginally exceeding the company’s guidance range of 1,085-1,120 MMcf/d.The company has no control over the fluctuating commodity prices that have dropped from the highs reached in the first half of 2017. The third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $2,316 million, which reflects a sequential decline of 14.7% accommodates a likely drop in commodity prices. We expect the drop in commodity prices could impact performance of the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Anadarko Petroleum is going to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Anadarko Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of -2.07%.

126,APC,"Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report) updated outlook for the third quarter of 2017 owing to solid production from itsorganic and inorganic assets.Details of the UpdateOn the production side, the total oil volumes for the third quarter have been raised to 126-130 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d), reflecting 4% increase from prior expectation. The company’s natural gas volumes are anticipated have been raised to 965-990 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while natural gas liquids (NGLs) are expected between 63 and 65 MBbl/d for the quarter.On the sales end, volumes for the third quarter have been raised to range between 352-358 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), reflecting 3% rise from the previous expectation.However, the company has maintained original capital expectation of $625-$725 million for the quarter.Reason for Update?The company updated outlook on the back of several favorable factors. Better-than-expected rise in DJ Basin volumes due to robust performance in Wells Ranch and East Pony have led to an increased oil production. Along with this, its first central gathering facility came online in July andhasbeen connected to the Advantage Pipeline taking crude volumes to Crane County, TX.Robust performance in Eagle Ford due to increase in South Gates Ranch activityas well as inAlba field reflect an overall increase in the company’s production volumes.Factor to Drive Peer PerformanceThe Houston, TX-based company has been engaged in making the most of its well placed organic and inorganic assets. As such it has been gravitating toward expansion techniques for exploring and producing more crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) globally. The company has a diversified basket of short and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, in domestic and international locations.With robust productions from its existing assets, the company is well poised to benefit and further aid the company to achieve better results. Noble Energy is also currently benefiting from a number of asset divestments that are driving overall production. Consequently,it is important for peers like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc.

130,APC,"Midstream oil firm, Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP  recently declared an open season for its Cheyenne Connector pipeline that links Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin to Rockies Express Pipeline’s Cheyenne Hub, which is located south of the Colorado-Wyoming border.Previously, Tallgrass Energy had inked agreements with subsidiaries of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and DCP Midstream, LP (DCP  -  Free Report) to transport 600 million cubic feet of gas per day (MMcf/d) through the pipeline, which is expected to come online in the third quarter of 2019.Importance of the PipelineGas production in the DJ basin is expected to rise substantially by 2020, which will increase the demand for pipelines.Previously, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) unit, Colorado Interstate Gas Company enjoyed the maximum share of DJ Basin's production. Production from the basin could get affected by capacity constraints of Colorado Interstate. We believe that The Cheyenne Connector can use the situation to its advantage by providing shippers more outlets to reach their target markets.About the PipelineThe Cheyenne Connector will be 70 miles long with a large diameter and significant expansion capability.

131,APC,"In a low oil price environment, oil companies looking for options to reduce the cost of production and cope up with oil price volatility. For this reason, many of the U.S. oil companies have left the Canadian oil sands and moved to the Permian Basin where production cost is lower.Apart from the Permian Basin, there are five other major oil producing regions in the United States, which are covered by EIA in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. These include Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.However there is growing interest in another shale play located to the north of Permian Basin. It has witnessed a brisk increase in investment and drilling activity recently, which has prompted the EIA to include the region in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. The growing presence of shale players in the Anadarko region may have led to its inclusion. The region incorporates 24 Oklahoma and five Texas counties.Production Related DetailsIn terms of production, the Anadarko region generated 447,000 barrels of oil and 5,979 million cubic feet of gas per day in August 2017. Moreover, the region is becoming popular due to surging natural gas production and the trend is expected to continue in the coming month.The month over month data shows that the region is likely to register an increase in oil and gas production, for September 2017, by 12,000 barrels and 78 million cubic feet per day, respectively.Why the Shift?The interest in Anadarko region – incorporates one of the most prolific natural gas reserves in North America – can be attributed to the rising opportunity of using upgraded drilling and completion technology.Another factor that is increasing the focus on Anadarko is rising lease operating expenses in the Permian Basin. There is also a shortage of oilfield services and occasional production hiccups from time to time in the Permian Basin. Investors should know that 129 rigs, as of July, were actively engaged in drilling activities in Anadarko basin, which were less than 373 active rigs in the crowded Permian Basin.The Anadarko region includes the STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) and the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) plays. These two areas have witnessed an increase in investment from exploration and production companies in the recent years.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), SandRidge Energy, Inc. , Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) are among the oil companies operating in the basin.

132,APC,"Tropical storm Harvey is intensifying in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and is predicted to become the biggest hurricane to hit Texas in the last 12 years. Energy companies are thus busy chalking out ways to counter the storm which is expected to result into a major landfall by tonight or tomorrow.Impact of Hurricane Harvey The U.S. National Hurricane Center has issued a warning of severe rainfall and heavy flooding across eastern Texas, GoM, Louisiana and the lower Mississippi Valley. The agency expects Hurricane Harvey to become a category 3 hurricane having wind velocity between 111 miles per hour (mph) and 129 mph. The hurricane is likely to cause weeks of disruptions at refineries in its path and shut units, spark fires and create supply shortage affecting facilities for months.GoM, which is expected to bear the brunt of the storm, is the energy hub of the United States. It accounts for about 18% and 5% of the total oil and gas production of the nation respectively. The region is also a home to about 50% of the country’s refining capacity. Refineries in the path of the storm have already shuttered leading to weaker crude demand and reduced gasoline supply.The sudden outages in the refineries are forcing traders to buy gasoline as they are expecting the commodity price to rise further in the future. With the anticipation of lower future crude prices, traders are selling oil.Oil prices fell by more than 2% to eventually close at $47.43 per barrel on Aug 24, owing to the anticipation of reduced demand of crude oil due to the hurricane. However, gasoline prices rose by 2.8%, resulting in a three-week high to eventually close at $1.66 per gallon.How Have Energy Players Responded?The storm has affected the operations of the energy companies and they are take measures to combat its effects. Several energy companies have suspended their offshore operations already or are in the process of evacuating their oil and gas facilities in GoM. Nearly 10% of the GoM crude output capacity were closed on Aug 24.Major energy players like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have already shut their production platforms in the GoM in the wake of the expected landfall. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anadarko Petroleum has temporarily stalled its production in Boomvang, Gunnison, Lucius and Nansen oil fields. Exxon Mobil has also planned to reduce its output at Hoover Facility in GoM and evacuate its staff from the offshore facilities. Shell has suspended production at Perdido — the deepest production platform — and evacuated the facility. Statoil ASA  is on its way toevacuate staff from the Eagle Ford shale region in South Texas.Independent refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is keeping a close watch on its facilities in Corpus Christi as Hurricane Harvey is forecasted to douse the region. Two refineries — with refining capacity of 450,000 barrels per day of crude — were shut in Corpus Christi, the home to some of the major refineries in the nation. However Chevron Corporation and (CVX  -  Free Report) and BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) have not interrupted their operations or evacuated their facilities.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

The average sales volume was within the expected range of 626,000–648,000 BOE/d for the second quarter.The company’s total costs and expenses increased 26.4% year over year to $2,841 million, primarily due to higher exploration charges.Interest expenses came in at $227 million, increasing nearly 4.6% from $220 million incurred a year ago.Financial ConditionAnadarko Petroleum had cash and cash equivalents of $6,008 million as of Jun 30, 2017, up substantially from $ 3,184 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Long-term debt as of Jun 30, 2017 was $15,436 million, reflecting an increase from $15,281 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Anadarko Petroleum's net cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $857 million compared with $1,229 million generated from operations for the quarter ended Jun 30, 2016.GuidanceAnadarko expects average daily sales volume in the range of 630,000–652,000 BOE/d for third-quarter 2017.The company projects its 2017 sales volume in the range of 633,000–644,000 BOE/d, down from  the prior expected range of  644,000–655,000 BOE/d for 2017.

134,APC,"Oil and gas exploration and production company, Sanchez Energy Corporation (SN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to divest its Javelina asset, located in the Eagle Ford Shale, for around $105 million.   The cash transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.About JavelinaThe transaction with an undisclosed buyer includes around 70,000 net undeveloped acres, with 450 net potential locations in the LaSalle and Webb Counties, TX. Sanchez built this large contiguous acreage over the last 18 months. Per the company, the Javelina assets include about 120-acre well-spacing, with 80% drillable acreage and 100% average working interest. The company's estimations indicate that the total of drilling, completion and facilities costs of each well in the area is $6.0-$7.5 million. The average estimated ultimate recovery from each well in Javelina is 1,500 - 2,500 thousand barrels of oil equivalents (Mboe).Per Sanchez’s estimation, at the end of 2016, the acreage had net present value of $601 million. The risk profile of the asset increased owing to the lack of development, which indicatthe current value of the Javelina assets will be far less than $601 million.Deal RationaleOne of Eagle Ford’s biggest operators, Sanchez had no plans for developing the Javelina area in 2017. Instead, the company is looking to concentrate on increasing production from other development opportunities, which require funding. Also, at the end of second-quarter 2017, the company had only $128 million cash on hand that justifies the liquification of the relatively risky Javelina acreage. In this context, we would like to remind investors that the company divested some of its Eagle Ford Shale assets for $50 million in Jun 2017 to oil and gas company, Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report).The development opportunities on which Sanchez will concentrate for production include the Eagle Ford shale basin acquisition in Mar 2017 from rival shale player Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report). With a debt of $1.8 billion and more development opportunities than capital to work with, Sanchez requires more liquid strength. We think this might trigger another divestment in the near future.About the Company Sanchez is an oil and gas exploration and development company, which is focused on the exploration, acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources. The company primarily operates in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. It is headquartered in Houston, TX.Price PerformanceSanchez has lost 44.7% of its value year to date compared with the 32.7% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSanchez has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock from the same space is Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report). It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Range Resources’s sales for 2017 are expected to increase 124.2% year over year. The company has a four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 51.8%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

135,APC,"We updated our research report on Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) on Aug 18. This oil and natural gas exploration & production company’s second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of improving cost structure and commodity prices.Devon has been able to generate positive results through cost-cutting initiatives. The steps resulted in savings of more than $1.4 billion in annualized Operating and General and Administrative expenses. The company expects these savings to be sustainable in 2017 owing to higher production rates from the company’s U.S. resource plays and relatively flat Lease Operating Expenses.Devon continues to monetize its non-core assets and use the proceeds to lower its debt levels. Debt reduction in 2016 had lowered its annual forward financing costs by $120 million. The company aims to monetize assets worth $1 billion over the next 12-18 months. Devon has already sold $340 million of assets and achieved one-third of its divestiture target.During 2017, the company plans to invest $1.9-$2.2 billion in Exploration & Production activities. Consistent investments in resource-rich assets are helping it boost total production. Devon now expects 2017 total U.S. daily oil production to improve in the range of 18-23% from the 2016 level. Rapidly expanding higher margin production is expected to drive production level higher in 2018.However, Devon operates in a highly competitive oil and gas industry. Some of the competitors in this industry are financially stronger than it with more resources at their disposal. This might limit Devon’s capacity to apply for new drilling rights or acquire properties.In addition, certain properties in which Devon has a stake are being operated by third parties. As a result, the company has limited control over these operations or the fate of their future development. These limitations as well as Devon’s dependence on the operator and other working interest owners over these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect its financialsDevon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings Performance of the PeersAmong the other companies in the same industry, Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) and WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report) second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) missed the same.Price Movement Devon Energy has lost 7.1% compared with industry’s decline of 11.9% in the last month.The industry Devon belongs to was adversely impacted by substantial drop in the commodity prices. Its focus on higher oil production, cost savings, divestment of non-core assets and systematic investment are likely to drive its operations.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

136,APC,"We updated our research report on Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) on Aug 17. This oil and natural gas exploration & production company reported a loss in the second quarter, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite the company’s disappointing performance in the second quarter, its premium shale properties, including the Delaware and Denver-Julesburg basins, and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico are expected to be the primary production drivers in the future.In addition to domestic assets, Anadarko’s international assets are also yielding positive results. During the second quarter, the company increased sales volume by 25% year over year, driven by oil volumes from the TEN project offshore Ghana. New discovery and existing Columbian assets will boost the performance of the company.Anadarko Petroleum has been systematically selling its non-core properties since 2004. The company exceeded its monetization target of assets worth $4 billion in 2016. It monetized asset worth nearly $3.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company will utilize the proceeds to repay debts and strengthen its balance sheet.Anadarko operates in a highly competitive oil and gas business space.  Some of its peers like major integrated oil companies, state-owned foreign oil companies and independent producers of oil and natural gas have greater and more diverse resources.Oil and gas companies need to explore and find economic reserves to stay competitive in this space. Increase in dry hole expenses is a cause of concern for the company. Dry hole expenses in the first six months of 2017 were $843 million compared with $6 million in the year-ago period. This will adversely impact the margins of the company.Anadarko Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

137,APC,"Brazilian state-run integrated energy company Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently discovered oil accumulated in the pre-salt layer of Campos Basin in the Marlim Sul field area offshore Brazil.About the DiscoveryThis is the company's first commercial oil find in Marlim Sul’s pre-salt layer. At a depth of 4,568 meters, Petrobras hit a new accumulation while drilling a well commonly known as Poraquê Alto, located 115 kilometers east of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The company verified the finding with the help of profile data, gas detector, formation testing by cable, and fluid samples. Per Petrobras' analysis, there is presence of good porosity and permeability features in the carbonate reservoirs along with oil at a depth of 4,420 meters. The company expects the oil reservoir to be 45 meters thick. Aftermath of the DiscoveryWe would like investors to know that in the last few years, the company's production from the Campos Basin decreased consistently. Hence, the discovery will help Petrobras to increase the production level again in the region. The company expects more discoveries in the matured basin, aided by the production infrastructure that the company has already deployed.The latest discovery will help Petrobras with its strategy of opening new exploratory frontiers and intensifying pre-salt development. The will commence from 2020. The company continues to focus on the pre-salt layer due to its lower lifting cost of less than $7 per barrel.With this latest find, Petrobras joins the list of oil discoveries made by big companies like CoconoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Repsol SA (REPYY  -  Free Report). ConocoPhillips reported a huge oil discovery in Alaska in Jan 2017 and said that the company will split the working interest of the discovery with Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report). In Mar 2017, Repsol also discovered oil onshore Alaska.About the CompanyPetrobras is the largest Latin American oil and gas integrated company. It is involved in the exploration, production, refining, retailing and transportation of petroleum and its byproducts, both domestically and internationally. The company, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro,dominates Brazil’s oil and gas sector. It produces most of Brazil’s crude oil and natural gas and accounts for almost the entire refining capacity of the country.Price PerformancePetrobras has lost 22.3% of its value in the last six months compared with 13.3% loss of its industry.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

138,APC,"The Q2 earnings season has come to a close for all S&P 500 Oil/Energy companies. The sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index.After thorough research, we can say that the sector is poised to keep churning profits in the coming quarters as well. Hence, it is an ideal time for investors to scoop up more energy stocks.Oil/Energy Outperforms Other SectorsWe have divided the S&P 500 Index into 16 Zacks Sectors. As per the latest Earnings Outlook, among all the sectors, Oil/Energy has witnessed the highest year-over-year earnings growth. The Oil/Energy companies have recorded 252.7% earnings growth on the back of 16.8% revenue rise. The other sectors significantly lag Oil/Energy. Most importantly, the Energy sector alone is responsible for 2.3% year-over-year earnings improvement during second-quarter 2017 for the S&P 500 Index.What Drove Energy in Q2?The oil and gas pricing scenario in second-quarter 2017 was substantially better than the year-ago period.Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.Natural gas also made a modest recovery in Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price in 2016 in almost 20 years.  Energy Will Continue to Generate More ProfitDuring second quarter of this year, Oil/Energy sector has recorded profits as high as $8.1 billion, which surged from $2.3 billion from the April-to-June quarter of 2016. We are also expecting the sector to earn profits of $9.2 billion, $9.8 billion, $11.8 billion and $13 billion during 3Q17, 4Q17, 1Q18 and 2Q18, respectively.Also, for full-year 2017, Energy sector will witness earnings of $36.1 billion, which is considerably higher than $9.6 billion during 2016. The upward trend will likely follow in the coming years as reflected that the Energy sector will generate profit of $49.1 billion and $59.3 billion during 2018 and 2019 respectively.Major shale players in the U.S. – that include Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) – have been focusing on lowering capital spending for exploration activities following persistently weak oil and gas prices as compared to mid-2014 level. With lower investment from the U.S. shale companies and constant efforts by the OPEC players to combat low oil, the crude glut problem will likely get resolved in the near future.Time to Buy Oil/ Energy StocksThe expectation of improved oil prices is favorable for energy companies. The exploration and production firms will be able to sell the commodities at higher prices in the near future that will again push them to restart producing more crude and natural gas. With higher exploration and production activities, there will be more demand for oil field services companies to efficiently set up oil and gas wells.Also, increased output level could increase the demand for midstream energy infrastructure assets like pipelines and storage facilities for transporting and storing the commodities.Our ChoicesPicking the prospective energy stocks from the stock universe can be a daunting task. To simplify the task, we have selected stocks using our proprietary stock screener.We have picked stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Moreover, all these stocks have beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties primarily in the southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S.The stock’s diversified asset portfolio is spread between low-risk/long reserve-life Appalachian assets and large-volume/rapid-payout Gulf Coast properties.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and posted a positive earnings surprise of 250.00% for the second quarter. Also, for 2017 and 2018, we are expecting year-over-year earnings growth of 117.7% and 89%, respectively, for Range Resources. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP  -  Free Report) – headquartered in The Woodlands, TX – is involved in midstream operations like transporting and storing oil and gas. The partnership has a Zacks Rank #1 and has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate during the last reported quarter with a positive earnings surprise of 17.07%. For 2018, we are anticipating almost 25% year-over-year earnings improvement.Headquartered in Calgary, Canada TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) is a midstream energy player engaged in transporting natural gas. The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.00% for the last reported quarter.Also, for 2017 and 2018, we are expecting year-over-year earnings growth of 12.5% and 12%, respectively, for TransCanada.

(SUBCY  -  Free Report), based in Luxembourg, is the provider of subsea field development products and services to the offshore energy players globally. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 83.78%. We are also expecting Subsea 7’s earnings to grow almost 5% in 2017.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>
