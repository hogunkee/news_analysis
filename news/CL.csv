5,CL,"Trade wars are a lose-lose proposition. Neither the U.S. economy, Europe's economy nor China's economy is likely to benefit.Yet, there's another angle to President Trump's trade war with China. Many U.S. businesses have been in a quiet trade war with China for years.Credit-card companies, such as Mastercard (MA), would love to have full access to China's gigantic consumer market. But China's foot-dragging resistance has made access difficult.In its latest 10-K report, Mastercard noted that in 2017, China's central bank issued ""more guidance and clarity in addition to the 2016 regulations on license application and operational requirements for network operators."" Piling guidance on guidance has been the stall tactic for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe World Trade Organization ruled in July 2012 that China established a monopoly when it made Shanghai's UnionPay the country's sole domestic payment processor.In 2015, China finally agreed to heed the WTO ruling. Yet implementation has been slow.About a year ago, Reuters reported that Mastercard and other major credit cards were preparing to submit license requests to operate in China. Reuters said the regulatory hurdles in China could take two more years to clear.What does all this mean to stock market investors? So far, very little.If China eventually opens its credit-card markets in full, the opportunity would be tremendous for Mastercard (and its major rival Visa (V)).Meanwhile, investors should take the short-term view. Judge the stock on what Mastercard is earning now, not what might happen later.Last year, Mastercard grew earnings 24%, its best annual performance in six years. The Street expects earnings to leap 39%, which would be its best gain in 10 years.Mastercard's stock chart looks promising. The stock cleared a 183.83 buy point in a flat-base pattern in May. Now the stock is consolidating above its 10-week line.In the meantime, Trump has characterized the trade game with China as a sucker's game, with the U.S. being the suckers. Consider this: As the major payment processors have struggled to get full access to China's market, China's UnionPay has expanded its reach to 162 countries.Regardless of what an investor thinks of Trump, he's nailed China's stance for what it is: Free trade for me but not for thee.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:ObamaCare Just Exploded: What It MeansThe IPO Marijuana StockWhy A Failed Breakout Isn't Always A FailureIBD Stock Of The DayThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

Gallo is also president of Gallo Communications Group, a keynote speaker and Harvard instructor.Tips on reaching people:Keep it basic.

Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.China internet stocks were some of the top performers in June. But as stock market indexes came under pressure in the latter part of the month, so did China stocks. But pullbacks aren't necessarily bad, as they can lead to buying opportunities.Baozun stock is looking to close at its highest level in eight sessions, and to retaking the 50-day line Monday after hovering around that level for about two weeks of trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen a stock rebounds higher after finding support at the 50-day line, that could be a chance to add shares to a position. With add-on buy points, you want to buy as close to the 50-day line as possible to prevent from buying an extended stock.This represents Baozun's first pullback to the 50-day line, or 10-week line on a weekly chart, since the China stock's earnings fueled a breakout past a 52.43 buy point.The first two pullbacks to the 50-day line after a breakout are seen as good opportunities to add shares to an existing position, as long as the line is above the buy point.But Baozun stock plunged below the 50-day line in above-average turnover on June 27, closing below the buy point. That may have prompted some investors to exit their positions.That's why it's a good idea to take at least partial profits when a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended from a buy point. Baozun reached that level in its third week after the breakout.Meanwhile, Momo is holding above its 50-day line after rebounding from that level Friday. While Momo stock pared all its gains Monday after rising as much as 4.4% early in the session, volume isn't massive. If the stock was falling hard in heavy volume after rising that much, that would be very bearish.The cup-half-full investor would note that Momo battled back to break even after losing as much as 0.9% midway through the session.The chart for Momo stock looks similar to that of Baozun. Shares gapped up, past a buy point, after earnings and then ran up more than 30%. Then it pulled back to the 50-day line. But unlike Baozun, Momo never round-tripped its gains.As this is the first pullback to the 50-day for Momo after a breakout, it could qualify as an add-on opportunity as well.Momo's June-quarter earnings are projected to accelerate from 57% to 77% as revenue growth slows from 64% to 54%. Accelerating earnings growth is bullish. While the top-line growth is seen slowing, a 54% jump still represents strong growth.Meanwhile, Baozun is expected to see earnings growth slow from 29% to 17% on a sequential basis. Revenue growth is estimated to decelerate slightly from 25% to 21%.In addition to looking at stocks with strong technical action, it's important to focus on stocks that have good fundamentals.

21,CL,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts once wrote that the ""way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" He wrote those words in a 2007 opinion that turned back Seattle's race-based efforts to implement affirmative action-type policies to its local school district. While that case garnered a race-neutral result, his broader message seems to have fallen on deaf ears.In America, race-based policies are expanding not contracting.Rather than reaching down to lower-level schools, affirmative action policies are now exponentially expanding into corporate America.In recent weeks, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) have announced updated diversity policies for selecting new directors. Rather than simply selecting the best candidate, each company will interview a female and an under-represented minority for each open board spot. These policies resemble the National Football League's so-called Rooney Rule which requires that each team interview a minority candidate for open coaching slots.Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet were founded by, and still run by, white men. They have created tremendous wealth and many millions of jobs for women and men of all races and ethnicities. But in light of its new procedure, it's fair to ask: would Amazon reject Jeff Bezos from its board because he's a white male? That would be a disaster for Amazon's investors.It's also fair to ask if the race-hustlers and far-left unions that are pushing these racial and gender diversity initiatives care about corporate profits or return on investment. Liberal policies that their ilk promote, such as high taxation and regulation, diminish corporate profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlphabet announced its new procedure at its annual shareholder meeting a week after Facebook and Amazon did the same. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg proudly publicized its new policy after a question from Jesse Jackson in which he attacked the company because its ""top 15 employees are white."" Jackson lauded Sandberg's proclamation in which she also revealed that Facebook formulated the new board principles in conjunction with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).Likewise, Amazon's announcement came in response to an SEIU shareholder proposal pushing board diversity. Jackson was also in attendance to laud that racial initiative. Amazon has since claimed that it's not a new policy but just an affirmation of its practices already in place.There is reason to doubt Amazon's veracity.Companies may ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to exclude any shareholder proposal from their proxy statement. One of the easiest ways to do so is to show that the company already has practices in place that align with the proposal's request. If Amazon is telling the truth now, why didn't it make this basic appeal to the SEC?Amazon certainly avails itself of this option. In 2018, it petitioned the SEC for the right to remove nine proposals from its proxy statement — far more than most corporations do in a given year. Many of these requests involved more complex SEC provisions and legal reasoning than would have been needed to dispatch the SEIU's proposal, that is, if Amazon is telling the truth.What is true is that once the SEIU's proposal was on Amazon's proxy statement, it received support from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).ISS is one of only two major proxy advisory services. Operating with almost zero scrutiny, these firms increasingly exert outsized influence on environmental, governmental, and social issues. That's because, according to research from the American Council for Capital Formation, ""when proxy advisors recommend voting in favor of a proposal, large institutional holders support the resolution 80% of the time. And some funds automatically vote with the proxy advisors nearly 100% of the time.""ISS has become little more than a rubber stamp for liberal activist investors. From climate change to gender pay issues, to board racial and gender composition, ISS supports a full slate of far-left shareholder proposals.It's entirely possible that Amazon caved to the SEIU's proposal under pressure from ISS. If ISS can exert that much power over Bezos and Amazon — the richest person in the world and one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies — what choice do other companies have but to bend to ISS's liberal will?The outsized role of proxy advisors has received congressional attention. A bipartisan bill working its way through the House, co-sponsored by Congressmen Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., seeks to curb these firms' unchecked power.There are also non-governmental remedies.First, companies need to steel their collective spines and speak up. If ISS supports a shareholder proposal, the vote is essentially rigged. ISS clients often ""rubber stamp"" votes for its recommendations without any deliberative process. Since shareholder resolutions are non-binding, and these votes are all-but rigged, companies should give them little deference.Second, fund managers must take a more active role in evaluating ISS recommendations.Finally, the conservative investment community should work toward creating a proxy advisory service that reflects pro-growth and long-term return on investment metrics.Otherwise, conservatives may as well cede this entire space to liberal firms and watch corporate America drift further to the left. This year, with ISS backing, it's the Rooney Rule run amok. Next year, it may be something even more insidious.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsThanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.

28,CL,"Six months into the year, the performance of the current stocks in the IBD 50 looks good. Surprisingly good. Yet some stocks are naturally forming new bases.Among the companies that made the list after Thursday's market close, the average year-to-date advance stands at a stout 42%. Either way you cut it, the performance is oodles of times more than the 2.2% lift by the S&P 500, excluding dividends. Through Friday's morning trade, the Nasdaq composite reached 7672, up 11% since Jan. 1.However, no one knows what the next six months will bring. So it makes complete sense to gauge the health of the market on a day-to-day basis. Do it in three steps. One, track the major indexes. The Big Picture column helps immensely in this corner.Two, watch the action of the IBD 50. And three, closely observe the action in your own portfolio. If you're picking top-rated companies, you have insight into how the market leadership is acting.Currently, 13 stocks are trading 10% or more below their 52-week or all-time highs. The median correction within the IBD 50: a delightfully mild 5.5% from the 52-week peak.ZTO Express (ZTO) is about 9% below a 21.70 all-time high. As seen on a weekly chart, the midcap transport stock is working to keep above the rising 10-week moving average. Would a small dip below the 10-week line be reasonable? Yes, because the stock had performed admirably after a breakout past a proper entry point at 17.57 on May 14. After clearing the base, which has features of a double bottom, ZTO rolled ahead with a 23% gain.It's smart to take gains in most stocks when they build a profit of 20% to 25% from the breakout point, as ZTO shows.ZTO, a delivery giant and e-commerce play in China, joined IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday. It is forming a base with a 21.80 buy point.Canada Goose (GOOS) is trading about 14% below an all-time peak of 68.75. But in late June, the stock sank as much as 19% below that high. That means the current correction would be too deep for a flat base.The only stock within the IBD 50 that sits more than 20% off its high: Israel's SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG). At a June 18 short-term low of 45.85, it's fallen more than 35% off its 70.74 peak. The solar inverter firm has now spent more than four weeks below the 10-week moving average, yet has not challenged the 40-week line (equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart).An escalating global trade war with the U.S. would likely impact the future growth of some IBD 50 firms.

That came on news that Tesla Model 3 production topped 5,000 in the last week of June, the first time the electric vehicle maker hit that weekly milestone. But Tesla stock quickly pared gains, and by the close fell 2.3% to 335.07. Some analysts wondered if Tesla Model 3 output was sustainable.Likewise, Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all pointed lower before Monday open, but the actual indexes rallied for slim-to-solid gains.For what it's worth, Tesla stock fell 0.9% in Tuesday's premarket.Good news sometimes spurs selling: ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is an old stock market saying that doesn't always hold up. But the stock market does a good job of pricing in good news, especially if that news is expected. Tesla stock had rallied strongly in late May to June 18 as CEO Elon Musk predicted Model 3 output would hit 5,000 in the last week of June.Given that Musk's promises often don't hold up, it wasn't surprising to see Tesla stock rally early Monday. But ultimately the ""sell the news"" trend took hold.Wait for a proper buy point: Even at the Tesla stock intraday peak of 364.78, it was still well below a 373.83 handle buy point. When a stock clears a buy point, the odds are high that it will rise, and rise strongly. That's no guarantee, but you make big money bets when the odds are in your favor.Tesla stock also reflects a fourth investing lesson over the long run.Focus on the very best stocks: Tesla has a Composite Rating of just 38 out of a possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs. That reflects Tesla's significant losses and recent poor, sluggish share price performance. Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for nearly a year. The RS line really hasn't made headway for more than four years.Obviously, Tesla stock has been a big winner, from its April 2013 breakout to the end of February 2014. Perhaps the company is turning the corner in terms of production and cash burn. If so, the stock may be a big winner. But investors generally should focus on the best of the best of the best.Pivotal Software is a Dell spinoff. Its cloud-based service helps companies streamline software development and manage apps. Huya, a spinoff of YY (YY), is the leading Chinese streaming site for video games. IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, is called the ""Netflix of China.""Pivotal stock is finding support right at its 20-day line after the April IPO blasted higher in early June but then pulled back.The Chinese livestreaming IPOs have been consolidating for a few days before their 20-day lines, after significant pullbacks. Huya stock and iQiyi stock had skyrocketed in June, becoming sharply extended from their 10-day moving lines. That made a near-term retreat likely.On Monday, Pivotal stock rose 1.8% to 24.70. iQiyi stock rose 1.55% to 32.80. Huya stock sank 2.4% to 32.10, but held above a recent near-term low and closed near session highs.Early Tuesday, iQiyi stock and Huya stock rose 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Pivotal stock was not yet active.But it's early days for these stocks. Just because a stock has stopped falling for a few days, or even begun to move higher, doesn't mean it's a buy. Wait for a stock to consolidate and blast out of a new buy point.Just look at Brazilian IPO PagSeguro (PAGS). The payments stock rocketed from early February to late March. Then shares pulled back to the 50-day line and tried to bounce back. But within a few days PagSeguro stock broke down sharply.

35,CL,"All too often, stocks drop below their buy points only to bounce back above them. The big question for investors is, should they buy the second time around?The answer is yes, so long as the break below the buy point is modest and shares don't spend weeks below the entry.A minor decline is quite normal. Historically, 40% of stocks will dip back to or mildly below their buy points after a solid breakout, then resume their winning advances. So even when stocks exhibit power at the breakout, it's almost normal for them to recede to around the buy point.But once a stock falls 7% or 8% below the proper buy point in a good base, consider the breakout a failure. Such a loss triggers an automatic sell rule. You need to forget about the stock unless it later forms a new, sound pattern.Sometimes stocks will give signals that they'll bounce back. For example, the stock may make bullish price reversals or close near session highs on a daily or weekly basis. Or, the stock may bounce from a touch of the 50-day moving average. Both would indicate that institutional investors are buying on dips. Lacking those signals, a solid move back above the entry is still enough to make a purchase.One other point: If a stock reclaims the buy point, volume may be lackluster or weak. While big volume is ideal, what's more important is for the initial breakout to have strong volume. It should be at least 40% more than the 50-day average (a figure found in IBD Charts and IBD quotes); expect small and mid-cap stocks to show even higher volume, double or triple average.Chinese internet company Sina (SINA) broke out Aug. 7 last year past a 97.89 buy point; a few days later, it was below the buy point. Shares sank no more than 6% from the entry, so there was no sell signal. Instead, Sina found support at the 50-day line; on Aug. 11 it reversed higher (1), a bullish sign.The stock rose back above 97.89 the next session and sailed to 119.20 in five weeks, resulting in a robust gain of 22% and a good time to take profits.Whenever a stock spends several weeks below the buy point, unable to reclaim it, then the situation is more delicate. Chances are, the stock will form a new base and investors must wait for the pattern and new entry to develop.Atlassian (TEAM) broke out past a 38 buy point on July 25, 2017, and soon fell back below it. But instead of reclaiming the entry, the stock wound up forming a new base the next 10 weeks.The breakout from that August-early October formation at 39.35 has been the most successful ever for the work-collaboration software maker. Today, shares trade around 63.35, up 61% from the latest proper entry point.(A version of this column was first published on Jan. 12, 2018.

Visa stock found support at its 50-day moving average this past week, MarketSmith analysis shows.In what could be a key development in the online shopping era, Visa could abandon its faster-online-checkout option. Instead it would adopt a single shared-payment button for online payments with Mastercard (MA).Visa also has an alliance with PayPal. Users can now even draw on their Visa to pay for something via their phone in physical retail locations. This has given PayPal (PYPL) a foothold in this space, while increasing business for the credit card company.Microsoft has been the third-best performer in the Dow Jones.

In its most recent quarter the Redmond giant scored a double beat, with EPS up 36% to 95 cents and sales jumping 16% to $26.8 billion.In a somewhat similar pattern to Visa, Microsoft stock hasn't rallied much since clearing a six-week flat base in May. The stock remains in buy zone from its 97.34 buy point, closing at 98.61 on Friday.The Dow Jones stock got a boost back in March when Chief Executive Satya Nadella made sweeping changes by establishing two main divisions, continuing his transformation.

But several Dow Jones stocks have been solid performers. Nike (NKE) has sprinted to the top of the class of 2018, with Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also in the top five.Their performance is in stark contrast to the five biggest Dow Jones losers in 2018..The sneaker powerhouse stock has soared 27.4% since the start of the year. That includes 11 % surge in Friday's stock market trading to a record high.The sportswear behemoth vaulted over Visa to become the top-performing Dow stock after Nike released stellar earnings late Thursday. North America sales rose 3% after three straight quarters of declines. And Nike announced a $15 billion buyback plan.The stock has now blasted out of buy range after breaking out from an 11-week flat base on May 16. In addition it is trading way above its 50-day line, though its relative strength line remains off 2016 highs.Nike is the footwear leader in China, bolstered by the NBA basketball boom in that country.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe credit card giant's stock has been on a steady charge since the start of the year, and has seen its value jump by 16.2%. Visa earnings blew out views in the latest quarter with EPS soaring 29% to $1.11 and revenue jumping 13% to $5.1 billion.The Dow Jones stock broke out from a five-week flat base buy point of 125.54 on April 26, and is now slightly extended from the 5% chase zone. Visa stock found support at its 50-day moving average this past week, MarketSmith analysis shows.In what could be a key development in the online shopping era, Visa could abandon its faster-online-checkout option. Instead it would adopt a single shared-payment button for online payments with Mastercard (MA).Visa also has an alliance with PayPal. Users can now even draw on their Visa to pay for something via their phone in physical retail locations. This has given PayPal (PYPL) a foothold in this space, while increasing business for the credit card company.Microsoft has been the third-best performer in the Dow Jones. Indeed its annual price increase of 15.3% for the year has easily outstripped that of its more glamorous long-term rival Apple (AAPL), up 9.4%. In its most recent quarter the Redmond giant scored a double beat, with EPS up 36% to 95 cents and sales jumping 16% to $26.8 billion.In a somewhat similar pattern to Visa, Microsoft stock hasn't rallied much since clearing a six-week flat base in May. The stock remains in buy zone from its 97.34 buy point, closing at 98.61 on Friday.The Dow Jones stock got a boost back in March when Chief Executive Satya Nadella made sweeping changes by establishing two main divisions, continuing his transformation. Shifting focus away from Windows and toward the cloud, Microsoft will have one division focused on ""experiences and devices"" and the second on cloud and artificial intelligence platforms.""Computing experiences are evolving to include multiple senses and are no longer bound to one device at a time but increasingly spanning many as we move from home to work and on the go,"" Nadella said in a letter to employees.Boeing stock has really taken off in 2018, up 13.8% for the year to date. However the potential impact of the Trump trade war with China has weighed on shares in recent weeks.The aeronautical giant's stock closed Friday at 335.51, off 10% from its June 7 high. The stock's most recent breakout from a 14-week cup with handle base failed. Boeing stock flashed a sell signal on Monday after China ""firmed up"" commitments to purchase jets from European rival Airbus (EADSY) amid the spiraling trade war with the U.S.However Boeing orders remain strong, with India's Jet Airways this week announcing an agreement Monday to purchase 75 Boeing 737 Max jets.The Dow Jones aerospace giant is exploring new areas of innovation. Boeing unveiled a concept hypersonic jet at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation 2018 conference in Atlanta. The airliner would be capable of flying passengers across the Atlantic in just two hours, even faster than the legendary Concorde.Cisco Systems closes out the top five, with a year-to-date gain of 12.35%. Cisco just edged earnings estimates in its most recent quarter. EPS climbed 10% to 66 cents while revenue rose 4% to $12.5 billion. However the networking giant disappointed by only offering in-line July-quarter guidance.Cisco stock closed Friday at 43.03, below its 50-day line. It is in a flat base with a 46.47 buy point.Cisco stock popped in November after it reported earnings that beat views. The stock rallied again in February after the company announced a buyback.The Dow Jones stock has stepped up acquisitions to speed up its shift to software and services.

In some cases, companies are using older data analytics tools and labeling it as AI for a public relations boost. But identifying companies actually getting material revenue growth from AI can be tricky.X AI uses computer algorithms to replicate the human ability to learn and make predictions. AI software needs computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. The two most common types of AI tools are called ""machine learning"" and ""deep learning networks.""Nvidia (NVDA) is one company that can lay claim to AI-driven growth. Internet and tech companies buy its processors for cloud computing. Nvidia's AI chips also are helping guide some self-driving cars in early trials.Startups are racing to build AI chips for data centers, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices. Tech giants Apple (AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) have forged ahead in applying AI software to speech recognition, internet search, and classifying images. Amazon.com's AI prowess spans cloud-computing services and voice-activated home digital assistants.Then, there are tech companies that embed AI tools in their own products to make them better. Those include video streamer Netflix (NFLX), payment processor PayPal (PYPL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook.Customers of tech companies — spanning banks and finance, health care, energy, retail, agriculture and other sectors — are expected to increase spending on AI to get productivity gains or a strategic edge on rivals.Bookmark this page to stay on top of the latest AI trends and developments.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Technology Stocks And Related NewsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

46,CL,"Baozun, a May 2015 new issue, has waged a terrific run-up ever since it cleared a super-deep bottoming base at 9.99 during the week ended Aug. 26, 2016. How long can its rally last?And more importantly, how much impact could the China-U.S. trade dispute have on the company's fundamentals?To answer the first question, it's really key to learn how to count bases.After a stock breaks out of a sound chart pattern, watch to see if rises 20% or more. If it does, the next serious decline begins the process of a new base.What if a stock rises just 15% from the proper buy point, then settles into a new base? Put another way: You find a stock that launches out of a cup with handle, breaks out, goes up 15%, but then forms a flat base on top of that cup? In most cases, both bases count as one entire base. IBD calls it simply a base on base.Going back to Baozun (BZUN), the stock nearly doubled in price and hit all-time highs after that first breakout in 2016. Base No. 2 was also quite deep, but Baozun cleared a 17.68 entry during the week ended May 5, 2017. That breakout spawned a 130% advance.Baozun formed two more bases, one from September 2017 and another from March 2018. These two bases showed big weekly price swings. But the breakout from these bases showed hefty volume, a good sign.Some late-stage breakouts can work, even if there's higher risk of failure, when a company has truly excellent fundamentals and solid institutional sponsorship.This week, the stock has fallen to the 10-week moving average for the first time since its May 17 breakout. A first or second rebound off the 10-week line offers investors a fresh opportunity to buy shares. Risk is higher now with the market's outlook downgraded by IBD on Monday to ""uptrend under pressure.""During a rally off the 10-week line, look for a swell in turnover. A strong price gain in heavy volume signals solid institutional demand. Try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line, or in this case, near 55.70.Contrast Baozun's action to fellow Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW). The latter dropped briefly below its 50-day moving average on Friday, then closed beneath the line on Monday. Volume hasn't been overly intense, however. On Monday, ServiceNow saw trading volume increase merely 3% above average.To answer the second question, on the U.S.-China trade dispute, it's key to study recent numbers.Baozun, the expert in e-commerce markets in the second largest economy, has superior earnings gains. According to IBD Leaderboard, the average EPS increase over the past three quarters is 58%. The Street sees earnings rising 27% in the second quarter.In Q1, the Shanghai-based firm reported a profit 0f 9 cents per share, a penny above the consensus forecast. Revenue has jumped 24%, 19%, 31% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.According to a May 17 news release, Baozun said the number of its brand partners rose to 156 as of March 31 from 125 the same time a year earlier. Officials do not make clear how many of those partners are American corporations. One can surmise that many of its brand partners are East Asian companies. For instance, Baozun established a wholly owned subsidiary in October 2014 to expand its e-commerce services to the Taiwan market.In October 2015, Baozun started a 100%-owned unit aiming to introduce more Japanese brands to Chinese consumers. And in September 2016, it launched a joint venture with a division of the South Korean culture and lifestyle conglomerate CJ Group ""to introduce highly sought-after Korean brands to Chinese consumers,"" according to a filing with the SEC.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:The Bull Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Critical Sell Signal5 Reasons Why This Market Uptrend Is Still StrongThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner: This Should Happen On Breakout DayHow Many Chinese Companies Make The IBD 50 Today?

47,CL,"If you follow the Investor's Business Daily analysis of the stock market closely, you know that a significant shift took place this past Monday.The Nasdaq composite got hammered by sellers on June 25, falling 2.1% in heavy turnover. That sell-off, combined with a dearth of impressive breakouts lately and a large load of distribution days (or significant declines in higher turnover), sent IBD's Market Pulse outlook in The Big Picture column one notch down to ""uptrend under pressure.""The outlook change doesn't mean you must sell the top dogs in your portfolio. View the new status as a yellow light on a traffic signal. Don't come to a full stop. Proceed with caution. But as the IBD 50 shows, if you hold many superior growth stocks, then you likely felt the heat of institutional selling a lot more than your neighbor who exclusively trades index ETFs.Major indexes showed nice rebounds on Thursday and through Friday afternoon trade. The S&P 500 cut its weekly loss to less than 0.6%. But companies in the IBD 50 shaved off a lot more of their recent gains. Twenty names, or 40% of the entire list, slumped more than 3% for the week through Thursday's close. Only Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), ZTO Express (ZTO) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and two more gained 2% or more.If you bought a true leader early in its run and your paper profit has topped 50%, 100%, or more, then you have the luxury of choices. If the stock is correcting in normal fashion, you might keep the entire position and wait for it to break out again. Or you might sell some shares, and give the rest a chance to grow more. A third option? Sell the entire position. Sit on the cash until you find a new royal opportunity.But what if your post-breakout gain runs in the 10% to 25% range? If you didn't take at least partial profits on the way up, then consider deciding where to draw the line in the sand.One of the most relevant sell rules: Don't let a double-digit gain turn into a loss. To go from, say, a 28% gain to an 8% loss not only hurts your portfolio; it can damage your personal investing psychology. If you come away with a single- or small double-digit gain, you can always buy back shares when the market shows better action.Momo (MOMO) illustrates how the 10-day moving average could help investors keep most of the advance after a May 18 breakout.At first, the move above a 40.55 buy point in an eight-week cup base was dull. But six sessions later, the Chinese social media play roared like a lion. It gapped up 15% in heavy volume on superb Q1 results (EPS up 57% to 69 cents, revenue up 64% to $435.1 million). Nine trading days later, the gain from 40.55 to a new high of 54.24 gushed up to 33%. A great profit.Besides selling on the way up once the stock hits the 20%-25% profit zone? Look for a sharp undercut of the short-term 10-day moving average. Momo did just that on June 19, falling 3.8% to 51.09. The 10-day line stood at a lofty 52.09, well above the 50-day moving average's value of 41.18. Sell at the June 19 close, and you would have locked in a 26% profit. (The 10-day line is not plotted on IBD Charts but is available in MarketSmith.)Momo's cup was lodged inside a larger, much deeper base. The stock has a penchant for making really big moves, really fast. So the recent waterfall slide to 41.44, just 2% above the 40.55 breakout point, should not come as a big surprise.All daily charts in IBD Leaderboard show the 10-day moving average as a green line.You can trade the IBD 50 in just one transaction with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

81,CL,"With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you identify the best stocks to buy and to have on your watchlist? Start by regularly checking stock lists like Sector Leaders, IBD 50 and the IBD Big Cap 20, all of which have a proven track record of outperforming the S&P 500.From big names like Apple (AAPL) and the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — to lesser-known companies like teen-focused discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) and chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), the top-performing stocks consistently appear on IBD's screens in the early stages of their major price runs.Be sure to also regularly check IBD Stock Lists Update, which shows you which stocks were just added to — and removed from — Sector Leaders, IBD 50 and other screens.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe table below shows how indexes based on IBD's stock lists have significantly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500. In 2017, the Sector Leaders screen more than doubled the performance of the S&P, while the IBD 50 outpaced it by 79%. In Q2 2018, IBD stock lists continued to top the S&P 500. (Data as of June 29, 2018).See How To Use IBD Stock Lists And RatingsThe strategy behind IBD's stocks lists is simple.Through an ongoing study of every top-performing stock over the past 100-plus years, we've identified seven common traits big market winners typically share just before they launch their major moves.Using IBD SmartSelect Ratings and other screening criteria based on that research, we identify which stocks are most strongly showing those same traits right now.In other words, history shows what big market winners look like in the early stages of a new climb, and IBD's lists alert you to stocks that have that same look today.Also note that the screens are computer-generated and based solely on objective rules, not human emotions, guesswork or predictions.While you should never just buy a stock because it's on one of IBD's screens, regularly checking Sector Leaders and other lists is a quick and efficient way to build your own watchlist and zero in on the next crop of potential big winners.To further speed up your research, you'll also find alerts to stocks in or near a potential buy zone in the chart analysis provided for each name on Sector Leaders, IBD 50, IBD Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and Stock Spotlight.For example, self-driving car technology leader Nvidia was featured in the IBD Big Cap 20 on March 1, 2016 and in the IBD 50 the next week on March 7. The chart analysis noted that the stock was ""working on cup base with 34.04 entry, strong weekly RS line."" That gave you time to put Nvidia on your watch list and research the company before it broke out two weeks later.From the breakout, Nvidia rocketed over 660% in just 24 months before pulling back. Throughout its run, Nvidia has continued to show up on various IBD lists and is still on the IBD 50. Nvidia is just one recent example of why you want to regularly check IBD's stock lists as part of your investing routine.Not every stock on the lists will launch those types of gains, but checking these screens regularly is a proven way to help improve your investing results by quickly building a high-quality, actionable watch list.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Companies Are On IBD Stock Lists Right Now?Facebook, Nvidia, Netflix Reveal 3 Key Stock-Picking TipsLessons On How To Invest: When To Buy And Sell, Chart Reading And MoreVideo: How To Find Top-Rated Stocks Before They Break Out

82,CL,"Walt Disney (DIS) won U.S. antitrust approval for its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets, raising hurdles to a potential rival bid from Comcast (CMCSA).XDisney agreed to sell Fox's regional sports networks to resolve the Justice Department's concerns that the deal would raise prices for pay-TV companies, according to court filings made Wednesday in New York.Disney rose to a session high after Bloomberg reported that the government clearance was imminent. It climbed 1% to $105.41 at 12:11 p.m. in New York. Fox gained as much as 2.5%.The approval is a victory for Disney in its battle with Comcast for one of the media industry's biggest prizes. Fox last week accepted a sweetened bid from Disney, which upped its offer following Comcast's competing $65 billion bid. The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December -- and $3 above Comcast's bid.Comcast is now mulling its next steps, including possibly teaming up with private equity investors in its pursuit of Fox assets, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal reported that if the bidding reaches a high enough level -- say, $90 billion -- the company may go to private equity firms or other backers for help. In one scenario cited by the newspaper, a strategic investor could take on Fox's U.S. assets -- including the 20th Century Fox studio and regional sports networks -- and leave Comcast with overseas assets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

88,CL,"Trade Desk (TTD) is getting a boost from European regulatory pressure on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and also could see long-term upside from AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), Susquehanna Financial Group said Thursday.Shyam Patil, a Susquehanna analyst, raised his price target on the provider of automated advertising technology to 105 from 81.

89,CL,"Apple (AAPL) continued to show market leadership. The megacap tech refused to give up any of its solid gains over the prior three sessions while Microsoft (MSFT) edged higher for a fourth day in a row as large and megacaps outperformed the small-cap space in stocks today.While the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% for its fourth win in a row. The Russell 2000 dived 0.5%. But the latter has a bigger year-to-date return. The Russell, at 1694, boasts a 10.3% advance. The Dow, at 24,919, is up just 0.8%.Fellow Dow Jones component Microsoft (MSFT) edged up less than 0.2% to 102.01 but is now within spitting distance of hitting new highs. The diversified software and consumer electronics powerhouse has advanced 18% since breaking out of a six-week flat base at 86.30 in heavy volume on Dec. 15.The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. NYSE volume edged slightly higher, according to early data. Defensive sectors including food and utilities, as well as cyclical groups such as semiconductors, homebuilders, steel and automakers, paced the advance. Roughly eight of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 1% or more. (See the entire list of 197 IBD industries and the six-month relative strength rankings here.)The banking and transport sectors fell, losing some of their recent big gains. The Dow transports fell just 0.3%, but IBD's truck transport industry group skidded 1.7% lower. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) halted a three-day win streak, losing 0.6% to 106.62 and failing to close back above its 200-day line.As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, Apple cleared the 5% buy zone from a 179.04 correct entry in a narrow double bottom.Apple, rising to as high as 191.28 on Wednesday before closing off just 0.1% at 190.35, is now up 6.3% past the proper buy point. It's now extended.Micron Technology (MU), a current member of IBD's Sector Leaders, outperformed the market with a 3% gain to 55.74 in light trade. The data storage play reclaimed its 50-day moving average for the first time in two weeks and is trying to mold a new base.Stitch Fix (SFIX), a curated-apparel service popular among the young, surged to new highs with a 6% lift to 32.99. The Nasdaq stock is now up more than 9% past a cup-without-handle entry point of 30.17.Volume zoomed to triple its usual level of 2.1 million shares per day. The stock did suffer a sell signal after falling more than 8% from the entry, yet has recovered.San Francisco-based Stitch Fix notched $977 million in revenue in 2017, up 34%. This year, the Street sees the top line bulging 26% to $1.23 billion, then rising another 20% to $1.47 billion in 2019. However, earnings are seen slipping 41% to 19 cents a share in 2018 and falling another 26% to 14 cents a share in 2019 as the company invests aggressively to expand its services.The company shows excellent operating cash flow, coming in at $1.38 a share in 2017. That's quadruple the 32 cents it earned that year.Energy stocks were active, but a relatively large group of the sector's leaders retreated from session highs.Cactus (WHD), featured in IPO Leaders in the past and the new IBD Stock of the Day, bounced within a wide range of nearly 4 points before ending the day down more than 5% to 33.69. Volume surged five times above its 50-day average.For three sessions in a row, the stock tried to clear a 35.28 buy point in a narrow cup with handle. But some funds have used the opportunity to dump shares. Cactus went public at 19 a share on Feb. 8.A good cup with handle typically shows a minimum length of seven weeks. Think of it this way: The left side of the cup may form over three weeks, the right side in three weeks, and a downward-sloping handle over one week. That all adds up to seven weeks.However, IBD research has found that in some rare cases, a stock with extraordinary fundamentals can bolt out of a six-week cup with handle so long as it shows excellent price-volume action, has glowing fundamentals, owns a leadership spot in its industry, and is rising along a confirmed market uptrend.In his 2004 classic, ""The Successful Investor,"" IBD founder Bill O'Neil wrote that the cup with handle ""should be at least six to eight weeks in length, starting with the first week closing down off the stock's top.""On the positive side, the expert in wellheads and oil rig-related gear found buying support near its 50-day moving average. Cactus has rallied as much 97% from its IPO price.Notice how sell-offs in early and mid-June sent the stock briefly below the 50-day moving average.The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) ETF cooled off after rising sharply the past few weeks. The popular exchange-traded fund edged 0.4% lower to 43.97 in quiet trade. EEM is down nearly 7% year to date, hurt in large part by its 32% weighting in China.Notice how EEM posted a key sell signal on Feb. 5 as the ETF sliced through the 50-day moving average in huge volume. EEM eventually tested institutional buying support at the long-term 200-day moving average, bounced sharply and briefly flung above the 50-day line, and tried to build a new base.Yet since March, EEM has continued to struggle as the 50-day line became a level of resistance. The 50-day moving average has also been sliding for more than three months, indicating a negative intermediate-term trend.Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Securities, noted in a new monthly global economic outlook that his team believes ""global growth has peaked and, as it slows, we are most cautious in EM (emerging markets).""""We are specifically forecasting that global growth will slow from an annual rate of 4.0% in 2018 to 3.7% in 2019,"" he added.RELATED:The IBD Stock Of The DayDividend Stocks: These 6 REITs Crush The Yield Of The S&P 500 by 350%-475%Which 9 Stocks Currently Join IBD Leaderboard?Investor's Corner: Make Sure Every Breakout Has This Vital ElementWhich Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

Meanwhile, top Canadian stocks trading on the U.S. market, led by Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Canada Goose (GOOS) were unfazed. Both apparel stocks are sitting atop huge run-ups. Both held steady for the week.The White House in June imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imported to the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said in a June 3 Fox News interview that those initial tariffs closed loopholes that had led to ""several decades of abuse.""A month later, Canada retaliated. On July 1 it hoisted in-kind trade penalties against U.S. steel and aluminum.

International stocks, meanwhile, suffered further declines due to signs of weakness in the ""global synchronized growth"" which had propelled global equity markets going into 2018.World equity funds on average fell 2.04%, 2.96% and 2.87% in June, Q2 and the first half of 2018, respectively, according to data from Lipper Inc. Meanwhile, small-cap growth funds jumped 1.32%, 8.69% and 12.18% in those periods.The average U.S. diversified equity fund advanced 0.45%, 3.71% and 3.36%. Large-cap growth also did well, while value and alternative strategy funds lagged. By comparison, general U.S. Treasury funds rose 0.25% in June and 0.12% in Q2, for a yearly decline of 2.08%. However, corporate debt funds fell, resulting in the taxable bond fund group's overall decline despite high yield's solid performance.That said, Fidelity's Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer observed that U.S. markets remain in a ""twilight zone. Until January of this year, we had everything going for us: Fairly easy financial conditions and strong earnings growth from the tax cut provided a tremendous tailwind for the market.""However, since January, the market has been in a stalemate, he notes. Tightening liquidity due to rising interest rates and a stronger dollar have been a headwind for the market: ""It's like a tug of war, and the market has been stuck right in the middle of those two opposing tensions.""What Keeps Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Going StrongSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong the largest funds, $85 billion Vanguard Small-Cap Index (NAESX) soared 5.07% in June, for a Q2 gain of 6.59%, beating others by a wide margin. The fund holds such growth stocks as network security firm Fortinet (FTNT), financial software provider SS&C Technologies Holdings (SSNC), design software maker PTC (PTC), domain name marketer GoDaddy (GDDY) and ski resort operator Vail Resorts (MTN), all of which are up between 30% and 46% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFidelity's Timmer says he's seeing a pretty big separation in leadership. As of May, small-caps, which are mostly a pure play on the U.S. domestic economy, ""have broken out and made new highs, while the S&P 500 is still stuck in the trench,"" he said. The S&P 500 index, which has big exposure to foreign markets, rose 0.58%, 3.31% and 2.41% during the one-month, Q2 and H1 periods.He also pointed out that price increases by FAANG stocks, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), accelerated in June and remains very strong. This advance came at the expense of industrials (which did very well last year), and of financial stocks.Rich Weiss, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at American Century Investments, says that since the last two months of 2017 and throughout 2018, he's been more cautious on equities: ""Depending on the specific strategy, we either went to a neutral position — that is we weren't going to be overweighting stocks or buying on the dips anymore — or for our more risk-sensitive investors, such as in our target-date retirees entities, we actually moved to underweight equities. It's worked out fairly well for us overall.""Weiss explains that although economic growth continues to accelerate modestly, ""the primary source of that growth has continuously come from the corporate sector, in large part induced by the tax reform and the shot in the arm from the lower corporate tax rates. More importantly, we have not seen the beneficial halo effect for the consumer.""Other warning signs include a number of potentially inflationary pressures on the horizon: rising oil prices, potential wage inflation, accommodative fiscal policy and barriers to trade. ""You add higher interest rates, which are a done deal at this point, then the specter of inflation to an already somewhat muddled outlook for economic growth,"" he said, which results in an environment not that favorable for the stock markets. And while corporate earnings continue to do fairly well, ""they're a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator.""In addition, growth numbers out of Europe, U.K. and Japan have come in weaker, thus dislocating the synchronicity of growth experienced by worldwide markets earlier in the year.For the remainder of 2018, Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust, expects continued volatility and mid-single-digit returns for large-cap stocks. But a recession appears unlikely in the near-term.""Small-cap stock performance has been quite positive of late. This is one of several indicators that leads us to believe a recession is likely not on the horizon anytime soon,"" he said.American Century's Weiss points out that we're in the 10th year of an economic recovery, which is ""more than twice the length of a typical U.S. market cycle — it's pretty long in the tooth.""His message to investors is: ""Whatever you've been doing over the last nine years or so that may have worked for you is likely not to be the same strategy that works for you over the next year or two, because of this potential inflection point. Naively buying on the dips in the stock market works well in a bull market, but it certainly does not in a choppy market or a bear market if that's to come ... It is possible that cash is in the running to be king this year. Cash has a chance of outperforming both stocks and bonds.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIKE ALSO LIKE:What The Stock Market Is Doing Now

The Dow industrials got help not only from Apple (AAPL), but also seven other components within the 30-stock average that rose at least 2 points.

The fiscal year ends in September. For the June-ended fiscal third quarter, the Street sees profit up 31% to $2.18 a share on a 15% rise in the top line to $52.29 billion.

For a company that logged $229.2 billion in sales for FY 2017 and is the largest company in the U.S. financial markets with a $936 billion market value, such a rating is not shabby at all.However, all of the leaders making the IBD Big Cap 20 screen show Composite scores of 94 to 99.

105,CL,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P 500, closing the session at 2798, is up 4.6%.On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hits the wires at 10 a.m. ET.

110,CL,"AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and other internet service providers once again face the possibility that California will impose its own net neutrality rules, bucking federal regulators and possibly cutting into their business.California lawmakers on Thursday said they forged a deal on a new version of a net neutrality bill. The reworked bill would create the toughest rules in the U.S., state lawmakers said. California's bill prevents ISPs from exempting some services from customer data caps. It also bans ISPs from charging websites ""access fees"" to reach customers.California's State Assembly derailed a similar bill in June. State Sen.

112,CL,"The higher swipe fees American Express (AXP) charges merchants compared to some rivals will remain intact, after the Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lawsuit alleging the credit-card company stifled competition by barring merchants from encouraging customers to use cards that carry lower merchant fees.XThe court ruled 5-4 in favor of American Express, saying that the company's so-called ""anti-steering"" provisions didn't violate U.S. antitrust law. The decision could bolster American Express' financials, as credit card issuers, payment processors, banks and tech companies race to attract wealthier customers and adapt to a more mobile, electronic payments landscape.American Express closed up 1.35% at 98.54 in the stock market today. Rivals Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) both slid, falling 3.25% and 3.2%, respectively. Both Visa and Mastercard were testing support at their 50-day lines.Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 1.5%, touching its 200-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe plaintiffs — Ohio and a handful of other states — argued that American Express' rules resulted in merchants having to pay higher swipe fees, which, in turn, were inherited by customers. AmEx said, basically, that they didn't.Here are five takeaways from the court's ruling:Businesses have to stomach swipe fees like those from AmEx when customers use credit cards to buy things. Thus, they sometimes try to discourage, or ""steer,"" customers away from using cards that carry higher merchant fees. When a shop takes American Express, they typically agree to the card issuer's antisteering provisions.AmEx has been doing stuff like this since the 1950s. But Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote for the majority, said that the plaintiffs' case failed to show AmEx's practices harmed competition.He also said their case failed to grasp the balancing act of who pays what on either side of a credit-card transaction. And he argued that when defining the credit card market, it should include both merchants and cardholders. He said the primary product of credit-card companies was transactions, rather than merchant services. Thus, ""the competitive effects of a restraint on transactions cannot be judged by looking at merchants alone.""""Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot, by itself, demonstrate an anticompetitive exercise of market power,"" he wrote.Thomas said that instead, the plaintiffs needed to prove that American Express' anti-steering provisions raised the cost of credit-card transactions ""above a competitive level"" or reduced the number of credit-card transactions.Thomas also wrote that Visa and Mastercard have ""significant structural advantages"" over American Express. Thomas said that Visa and Mastercard accounted for more than 432 million cards in circulation in the U.S., while AmEx had only 53 million and that fewer locations accepted it.He also said that Visa and Mastercard get half their sales by collecting interest. American Express, conversely, gets most of its sales from merchant fees, and focuses more on rewards catered toward wealthier cardholders.""Amex's increased merchant fees reflect increases in the value of its services and the cost of its transactions, not an ability to charge above a competitive price,"" he continued.""It uses higher merchant fees to offer its cardholders a more robust rewards program, which is necessary to maintain cardholder loyalty and encourage the level of spending that makes it valuable to merchants.""Nomura analyst Bill Carcache, in a research note on Monday, said that a ruling against AmEx would be unlikely to cause significant damage to the company.He also said that AmEx's discount rates weren't much higher than other premium Visa and Mastercard cards, indicating that businesses wouldn't gain that much from discouraging customers from using their AmEx cards.""Although we never expected a negative fundamental impact on AXP's business even if the ruling went against it ... putting this issue in the rearview removes an overhang and is incrementally positive for the stock, in our view,"" he wrote.CFRA analyst Chris Kuiper appeared to agree.""We think this bolsters AXP's competitive positioning against rivals and removes a potential negative catalyst in the near term that may have been weighing on shares.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneIBD Stock Of The Day Is One Of Several Payment Processors In Buy ZonesSquare Moves Into Buy Zone, Leading Italy-Resistant Financials

It wasn't booted until it made a distinct break of that line, which teaches investors the importance of judging action at the 10-week line properly.The Chinese internet company, sometimes called the Craigslist of China, was added to Leaderboard on July 10 (1). At the time, the stock was breaking out of a cup without handle in double its usual volume. The base was well-crafted, with no wild price swings and a symmetrical outline.The stock closed slightly below the 47.48 buy point on the day of the breakout, but the next day it finished business above it. From that point on, shares never looked back. 58.com kept adding gains apace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Aug. 21, the company reported quarterly earnings. With some cushion from the entry, we decided to keep the stock through the report. The cushion would help absorb losses if results sparked a sell-off. Instead, shares soared more than 20% on the earnings announcement, widening the profit from the buy point.Some of the gains were wiped out in a Sept. 25 sell-off (2). But 58.com held at the 10-week and 50-day moving averages. That was a signal to continue holding. In fact, the show of support became a follow-on buy area for investors to add some shares and enhance their returns. Indeed, the stock quickly bounced back.By late October it was back to the 10-week line. This time, 58.com traded below the line, something that had not occurred in the entire run (3). Still, it was a modest drop below the moving average, and on Halloween the stock was right back above the line.In early December, a similar harmless pullback occurred (4). Yet there was something different this time. 58.com took longer to rebound, and a five-week cuplike pattern was actually an improper base. The stock managed to make some gains, but the peak was coming into focus.On Feb. 2, the stock closed the week down 15% and below the 10-week moving average (5). Notably, volume was 52% above average for the week. When a stock closes the week below the 10-week line in weekly volume at least 40% above average, that's a sell signal — one that had not appeared in earlier pullbacks.Conscious that 58.com was well past a standard 25% gain from the buy point, Leaderboard editors decided to remove the stock from the Leaders list. The profit from the breakout was more than 55%.Since then, 58.com has stalled. The stock broke out of another base on April 30, and was added back to the Leaders list at that time. But it was removed about three weeks later due to slack price action.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

Each manager focuses on different sector verticals — technology, biotech, consumer, financials, software and so on. Industrials, materials and energy are my areas. Our arrangement brings buy and sell decisions closer to the research process.IBD: You've outpaced the broad market in four varying time periods. What enables the fund to outperform so consistently?DeNichilo: The consistent focus of our process. Our sole focus is to find innovative, growing companies regardless of the macro environment's noise.We at Federated have used the same philosophy on our flagship Kaufmann Fund (KAUAX) (now a $6.6 billion midcap growth portfolio) for 30 years. And members of the small-cap fund's team have been working together on average over 15 years.IBD: Why use so many portfolio managers rather than analysts?DeNichilo: When you have companies that are small and growing 15%, 20%, 30% sequentially, things are moving very fast. You need to be on top of those. Our process brings the portfolio manager closer to the research process. The closer, the better. And on top of it, we have senior managers — I am one of them — monitor the portfolio, monitor risk management. They provide a sort of check and balance.IBD: Why does your fund participate in so many initial public offerings?DeNichilo: The team analyzes virtually every IPO that comes to market. I would say, broad brush, we buy anywhere from 25% to 50% of IPOs we see, varying widely throughout the years based on the quality of deals.Each IPO is vetted by the sector PM, who often has a solid working understanding of the company and market segment before the deal comes to market.Over 50% of the fund's holdings were initially bought on IPO. That's one of the most inefficient parts of the market. And buying at IPO gives us a first-mover advantage with a stock.IBD: Why has Veeva Systems trended higher the past couple of months?DeNichilo: This is a stock we've owned since the IPO. It has a fantastic combination of experienced leadership who know what to build and how.This is a SaaS (software as a service) solutions company for the life sciences market. Sort of a Salesforce.com (CRM) for life sciences.They have a proprietary content management platform that's used for medical promotions and regulatory-clinical trials. And it enables their customers to move critical functions in regulatory submissions and manufacturing quality to the cloud. They have a knack for hiring people with deep industry knowledge, who work closely with customers to build what their most advanced customers want, and apps that can be tailored and integrated for high levels of customer success.IBD: Grubhub's earnings per share growth has sped up for three quarters. Why?DeNichilo: This is another name we bought on IPO. They're in an enormous and rapidly growing total adjustable market. They stand to benefit. They're expanding into additional cities. They're signing major restaurant chains like Yum Brands.There's some concern about competition from Uber Eats and DoorDash. But we think the market is large and growing, with room for more than one player. And Grubhub has first-mover advantage and a strong brand name.IBD: Enterprise software maker RealPage has eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds. What's this feeding frenzy about?DeNichilo: This is another stock we bought on IPO in 2010. They are a real estate software company that helps solve huge inefficiencies in the property management vertical.They enable property managers to better manage renter life cycles and property management workflow. They are a leader in helping apartment owners manage their property, their tenants, their buildings, schedule repairs and take rental payments.They have a huge amount of recurring revenue, a nice history of hitting their numbers and they are a nice consolidator in the industry.IBD: After two quarters of declining EPS, Canada Goose posted gains of 39%, 48% and 166%. What do you like about them?DeNichilo: We think there's big growth in the consumer functional luxury space. Canada Goose is successful in their wholesale business, and is in the early stages of developing its retail business with just a handful of stores in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. And it's moving its brand beyond winter garments into an all-seasons assortment.The company limits distribution and inventory growth to maintain premium pricing and avoid discounting, which is the death knell for any retailer. Sales have grown in excess of 30% (annually). We think estimates for only 25% growth will prove conservative.IBD: Tyler Technologies is in the same IBD enterprise software group as RealPage. It provides IT management services and software for various levels of government. Why is that attractive to you?DeNichilo: They are a SaaS company for municipalities. They make government more efficient. Their software automates processes. It's used in everything from public safety to small-claims arbitration. It lets everything be done online.IBD: Government is often rapped for being slow and resisting change.DeNichilo: After the financial crisis, when municipalities found themselves in fiscal trouble, they saw the payback and return on investment for using Tyler was so large that they couldn't ignore it.IBD: What's your thesis for Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion control systems?DeNichilo: We think they are still an undercovered company on Wall Street. Management has done a fantastic job turning the company around, pivoting from cyclical to secular areas. Now they're focused on such secular growth areas as 3D printing, DNA sequencing, robotic surgery and warehouse automation.Novanta allows customers' (devices) to have precise movements down to the micron level. They've reduced their semiconductor exposure from 50% of revenue to less than 10% today. And they're focusing more on industrial automation and next-generation medical processes.IBD: What's the appeal of At Home Group (HOME)?DeNichilo: They're a value player that is taking share in retailing. They showcase a broad, inexpensive assortment of home decor in large-format stores. They were created out of the bankruptcy of the former Garden Ridge.Their productivity remains relatively low with significant opportunity for growth in same-store sales. They have plenty of real estate opportunities as other large-format stories like Sears and Kmart close.They have ability to grow 20% annually. They're not online currently, but that's a longer-term opportunity.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Millennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A MillionaireYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Indeed, he was so impressed with the Dow Jones firm's results he claimed that 2018 is shaping up to be ""the Year of Nike.""""Improved design and technologies and sufficient quantities (are) being brought to market with better speed (boosted by Express Lanes), whether with React (expanding more into Sportswear now as well), the Air Max platform (with 270s, Vapor Max, and more), or NBA,"" Svezia said in a research note. ""Jordan will also return to global growth this year and women's is a material opportunity as well.""Nike's Express Lanes initiative is part of its overall Consumer Direct Offense strategy, which aims to make its offerings more appealing and accessible to the consumer.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike CEO Mark Parker says Express Lanes cuts down the time between a product's design and its appearance on the shelves from months to a few weeks.The wider Consumer Direct Offense strategy aims to make Nike the leader in innovation, speed to market, and direct connections with customers through digital systems, membership and personalization.Nike stock vaulted 11% to 79.68 on the stock market today. Old rival Adidas (ADDYY) rose 2% and new pretender Under Armour (UAA) sank 3.9%. Among other footwear stocks Skechers (SKX) climbed 0.7% and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) sank 2.7%.Nike's continued innovation is leading to even more growth, further bolstering its profits.""Digital is also accelerating (+34%), aided by the SNKRS app and more, while helping drive margins,"" Svezia said.Nike is certainly continuing to pursue this space aggressively. In April Nike acquired body-scanning software firm Invertex, as it continues to beef up its digital technology, including its artificial intelligence capabilities. And in March it bought consumer data analytics company Zodiac for an undisclosed sum.Parker cited Nike's earnings as a harbinger of good things to come, and prove that his strategy is working.""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies and a return to growth in North America,"" Parker said in a press release. ""Fueled by a complete digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the foundation for Nike's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.""Meanwhile Svezia believes Nike is underplaying its hand with its outlook. He sees great opportunities in foreign markets, as well as at home. While North American sales grew 3% in the most recent quarter, that followed three straight quarters of declines.""There is opportunity in China and Europe in addition to accelerating growth in North America (on greater product availability and favorable comparisons) while gross margin should be supportive,"" he said.Nike is the footwear market leader in China and Cowen managing director John Kernan has said the current boom in popularity in the NBA will disproportionately benefit Nike over other brands.The sunny picture is in stark contrast to 2017, a tough year for the footwear industry in North America. This was despite collective sales of more than $74 billion, according to Euromonitor.Top brands including Nike and Under Armour struggled, while retailers had their own woes due to heavy price promotion.

131,CL,"When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA, bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (AKA, technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.TIP: For an even deeper understanding of how chart patterns work, read more about the concept and psychology behind bases.From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.Nvidia Breakout From Cup With HandleWhen Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose more than 700% over the next 27 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can identify the cup with handle that Amazon formed from October 2016 to February 2017.Learn More About Cup-With-Handle PatternsThe double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.Here's what to look for in a double bottom:Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.Facebook Breakout From Double BottomLike many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.Can You Spot The Pattern?Look at a weekly chart for Micron Technology (MU). Can you see the double bottom it formed from June to August 2017?Learn More About Double BottomsAs the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.Here are the key elements of a flat base:Netflix Breakout From Flat BaseNetflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can spot the powerful breakout Abiomed (ABMD) launched from a flat base in early January of this year.Learn More About Flat BasesGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Improve Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

137,CL,"Plains Group (PAGP) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 69 to 75 Tuesday -- a welcome improvement, but still short of the 80 or better score you look for. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily tracks price performance with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The rating shows how a stock's price behavior over the trailing 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. Over 100 years of market history shows that the best-performing stocks typically have an RS Rating north of 80 as they launch their biggest runs. See if Plains Group can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksPlains Group broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 25.96 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. Wait for the stock to set up and breakout from a new chart pattern and buy point. Also understand that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Plains Group posted -32% EPS growth last quarter, while sales growth came in at 26%. The company holds the No. 15 rank among its peers in the Oil&Gas-Transportation/Pipeline industry group.

138,CL,"Despite a huge gain since the April 27, 2017 debut, top stock and new issue Floor & Decor (FND) has had a rocky trading history. Now, it is shaping up to provide another potential buy opportunity. Shares rose 0.6% Friday in the stock market today.XThe newly-added Stock Spotlight member boasts stellar fundamentals.The most recent quarter shows year-over-year earnings growth that accelerated for a second straight quarter — from 31% to 58% to 100%.

But the stock's trading history leaves much to be desired.The top retailer has formed three separate bases that have triggered downside sell signals.First, the stock broke out past an IPO base's 43.20 buy point on June 19 — according to MarketSmith chart analysis. Several weeks later, the stock fell more than 7% below the entry, triggering the loss-cutting rule.Next, the stock moved past a 46.34 cup-with-handle entry on Dec. 4. This breakout showed much more promise, rising as much as 21% from the entry on Jan. 22. Investors could have locked in some profits at the 20%-25% profit-taking level.Less than one month later, the stock faltered as much as 18% off its high and giving back all of the breakout's gains — a round-trip sell signal.Finally, the most recent breakout above a 51.58 cup-shaped base on March 21 showed initial promise, as the stock moved up about 13% in just 11 trading sessions. But that gain would disappear on April 25 — a potential round-trip sell signal. Another sell signal triggered on May 3 when the stock gapped down almost 14% on cautious full-year guidance.RELATED:Five Stocks Just Added To One Of IBD's Top Screens — Which List?IPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesIBD Stock Of The DayECB Meeting, Adobe Earnings, Retail Sales Lead Investing Action Plan

139,CL,"With recent Dropbox (DBX) and Spotify Technology (SPOT) IPOs, here's one simple lesson to be learned from the initial public offerings of Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA), Snap (SNAP) and Square (SQ): Big-buzz IPOs don't always live up to the hype — at least not at first.X Buying a stock right when it has an IPO is a high-risk proposition, regardless of how convincing the hype may seem.Facebook, Alibaba, Snap and Square all headed south from their second week of trading, providing clear examples of why you should wait for a new IPO to form its first base before you invest.It's an important rule to keep in mind when evaluating IPO stocks like Dropbox, which just went public in March, and Spotify, which started trading in April.The Spotify IPO is technically referred to as a direct listing. This approach allows Spotify to avoid having bankers set the initial share price in a typical order book creation. The music streaming service has hit many of the right notes since its IPO and is now 6% a recent breakout.Dropbox had been on the same trajectory as Spotify, but that changed this week. After a heavy volume breakout on June 14, Dropbox's stock has dropped sharply over the last four days. The cloud-based storage stock is now back below its 34.93 buy point.The same lessons about how to buy IPO stocks apply to top 2017 new issues like Floor & Decor (FND), Canada Goose (GOOS), Smart Global (SGH) and Roku (ROKU).Zscaler (ZS) and Carbon Black (CBLK), both of which went public this year, have also had their fair share of post-IPO volatility.  Canada Goose has been one of the top IPO stocks in recent months, but it has also run into some selling pressure this week.The bottom line with all newer IPO stocks is that if you are going to trade them, you need to always follow a sound set of sell rules.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFrom its first weekly close on May 18, 2012, Facebook sank 54% over the next four months. Snap plunged 48% from its first weekly close on March 3 of this year until apparently finding a bottom in August. And after closing out its first week of trading on Nov. 20, 2015, Square fell 37% over the next 10 weeks.Keep in mind that if you take a 50% loss, you need a 100% gain just to get back to break-even.Alibaba fared better when it went public in September 2014, declining just 12% from its first weekly close while forming an IPO base.It did offer a buying opportunity when it broke out of that pattern in October, but the Chinese internet giant soon proved another point about new stocks: They can be quite volatile.After quickly rising as much as 20%, Alibaba reversed course, falling 47% from November 2014 until finding a bottom in September 2015. The stock continued to struggle and didn't really get going until it launched its current run with a breakout at the beginning of last year.Although many investors chose to ignore it amid all the buzz, Facebook flashed a serious warning sign before its IPO: a sharp slowdown in earnings growth.In the three quarters prior to going public, the company's EPS gains slowed from 100% to 25% to 9%. And in Facebook's first two reports as a publicly traded company, it posted 0% growth.It wasn't until about 14 months after its initial public offering that Team Zuckerberg finally found its mobile mojo and delivered a return to growth with earnings of 13 cents a share on a 58% gain in revenue for Q2 2013.Facebook bolted out of a double bottom on that report and made an impressive multi-year run, although the new Cambridge Analytica data breach has hammered Facebook's stock.Interestingly, it also took Square about 14 months of roller-coaster action before it found its market legs and began to climb. It's no coincidence that the provider of payment-processing software started to climb as its earnings growth started to improve.Square pulled back last November after a sharp climb, but has bounced back to form two new bases and and launch two new breakouts. The stock is now over 10% above its most recent buy point.Premium outerwear maker Canada Goose is yet another example of why it's important to give a new IPO time to set up. Since going public in March 2017, the Toronto-based stock has formed multiple bases, including a cup with handle that it broke out of in November. Canada Goose soared 41% last week on earnings, but has reversed somewhat to give back a piece of those huge gains this week.Specialty retailer Floor & Decor, which went public last April, pulled back after forming an IPO base, but went on to build a 26-week long cup with handle. Since then the stock has struggled to make a sustained upward move and is now testing support at its 10-week line.And then there was Snap.After heading due south for months after it went public, the Snapchat parent seemed to have found a bottom in mid-August, then popped in early February on its Q4 earnings report. But Snap has once again broken down and is now trying to find support at its 10-week moving average, which has fallen below its 40-week line. In addition to its chart action, keep in mind that unlike Alibaba, Facebook and Square, Snap has no profits.So while Snap may go on to make a nice run, the jury is still out.Buying a brand-new IPO can be tempting, but it can also be costly and painful.As the examples above show, you can significantly reduce your risk and still reap plenty of rewards if you follow these three steps:In other words, just like with any stock, make an IPO prove its fundamental and technical strength before you invest.If the pre-IPO buzz turns into a bust, you'll be glad you stayed out. And if the hype turns out to be true, you'll still have plenty of chances to profit.RELATED:Track Today's Top-Performing IPOsUse This Buying Checklist To Review A Stock Before You BuyNetflix, Nvidia Reveal 3 Telltale Clues To Look For In Stock Charts

141,CL,"Amazon.com's (AMZN) ever-expanding retail empire is going to need more workers and vehicles to get millions of packages to shoppers' doors. To do so, the web retailer is encouraging people to start their own delivery businesses.XFor those in the U.S. willing to strike out on their own in the service of the e-commerce giant, the Amazon delivery program will offer financial and operational support, the company says. Startup costs can be as low as $10,000. They also will get access to discounted trucks, uniforms, fuel, insurance and other resources, Amazon said.Amazon delivery capacity is an issue as it works on ways to expand. It's looked at everything from leasing its own cargo planes to experimenting with drones. It's also working on ways to move merchandise directly from merchants to consumers. The idea is to avoid overwhelming its own warehouses with inventory, documents reviewed by Bloomberg show.Amazon delivery long has relied on the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). It's also sought to gain more control over the logistics of package delivery, using its own technology and data-crunching abilities as well as facilities and transport to move packages around more efficiently.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Customer demand is higher than ever and we have a need to build more capacity,"" Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in the statement.Shares of Amazon were up fractionally, near 1,672, while UPS dropped 2.5% near 105.70 and FedEx lost 2% near 225.Those who succeed in the new Amazon delivery program can earn as much as $300,000 in annual profit by operating a fleet of as many as 40 delivery vehicles, according to Amazon. They will be able to build their businesses knowing that Amazon will provide shipment delivery volume and give them access to ""sophisticated delivery technology,"" the company said.Amazon says military veterans who qualify can get $10,000 in reimbursements to start their own delivery business.Amazon has employed independent contractors in the past to handle packages, especially during busy holiday shopping periods. Individuals can also sign up for a program called Amazon Flex to deliver merchandise using their own vehicles.

142,CL,"It's time to give Facebook's stock some credit.After a data privacy scandal knocked shares of Facebook (FB) for a loop in March, it's recovered in spades — so much so that on Thursday the stock made a breakout from a first-stage base.Facebook's chart is compelling. It recently cleared a double-bottom entry of 186.20, but the breakout was in light volume. Facebook recently added a handle area to its base, presenting an alternate entry of 188.42.It's not often that a former leader hit hard by institutional selling is able to come back, especially after a lengthy price run. Shares of Facebook hit an intraday high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, good for a gain of more than 400% since its May 2012 debut at 38. It closed at 38.23 on its first day of trading.So far, Facebook stock is proving its mettle.Even better, Facebook's price performance since a breakout from a base in late January 2017 offers a great illustration of why IBD rules for buying and selling are always prudent to follow.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base breakout in early 2017 wasn't perfect but still worked well and ended up being a perfect entry point.It cleared a first-stage cup-with-handle base during the week ended Jan. 27 in higher volume (1). The buy point at the time was 129.37. The breakout reinforced a steadfast IBD rule that says to buy stocks breaking out of bases when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. That was the case at the time.The base was first stage because the low of the base undercut the low of a flat base that formed a couple of months earlier. That served to reset the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more upside.But Facebook showed less-than-ideal price action the very next week when shares reversed lower in higher weekly volume. It was a sign of institutional selling — not good to see so soon after a breakout. But no sell signal was triggered as the stock held above the buy point and its 10-week moving average.Over the next several months, Facebook rode its 10-week moving average (drawn in red in the accompanying chart) higher (2). It didn't take long for the stock to trigger an IBD profit-taking rule that says to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it. Why? Because that's typically the time a stock starts to pull back and consolidate gains after a breakout.In early August, Facebook started to take a breather but didn't correct much off highs. A flat base eventually formed with a 175.59 buy point (3), but Facebook had a hard time breaking out. It rallied 4.9% before settling into a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. It rallied nearly 6% from the second breakout before settling into its current pattern.Big sellers were in Facebook in the week ended Feb. 9. Shares plunged 7.5% in higher volume, giving up support at the 10-week moving average. It rallied for a bit before plunging again during the week end Mar. 23. That was around the time of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.But it didn't take long for Facebook to recover as Wall Street placed bets that the company would live to see another day without a meaningful hit to earnings and sales.Shares of Facebook gapped up April 26 on bullish Q1 earnings. Investors were also cheered by a boost in daily user growth to 1.45 billion.RELATED:How The Correct Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityThe Ins And Outs Of A Double-Bottom BaseFacebook Will Reorganize Into Three Divisions, Plans Blockchain GroupGlobal Stock LeadersWhich Companies Are New To Key IBD Growth Stock Screens?

143,CL,"21st Century Fox (FOXA) accepted a sweetened, roughly $71 billion bid from Walt Disney (DIS) for its entertainment assets, dealing a blow to Comcast (CMCSA) efforts to acquire the business.The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December — and $3 above Comcast's bid from last week. The new agreement also offers more flexibility and other enhancements than the Comcast offer, Fox said on Wednesday.At stake is a trove of media properties, ranging from ""The Simpsons"" to ""X-Men,"" that may help fend off the threat from Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming upstarts. Both Disney and Comcast are looking to use the Fox assets to bolster their content and expand overseas.Disney's latest offer is a ""very aggressive move"" by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and may make it difficult for Comcast to respond, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Sweeney. Comcast's current bid was already poised to load the company up with debt, and its shares have fallen 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Comcast's balance sheet may preclude it from bidding much higher,"" Sweeney said. ""Further hampering Comcast's ability to respond is its position that it does not want to use its stock in a deal at these low levels.""The AT&T EffectThe tussle follows the AT&T (T) victory over the Justice Department in its antitrust battle to take over Time Warner. That outcome is expected to spur a wave of media consolidation, emboldening companies to get more aggressive with deals.The Disney-Comcast contest will determine who controls much of Rupert Murdoch's empire, including Fox's movie and TV studios, television networks such as FX, and multichannel providers like Star India and Sky Plc.But the two sides aren't vying for all of Fox. Part of the business will be used to create an entity called ""New Fox,"" which will include the highly lucrative Fox News, the sports channels FS1 and FS2, and the Fox broadcasting channel. That operation will be run by Lachlan Murdoch and focus on domestic television, news and sports.Disney's new offer gives Fox shareholders the option to take their payment in the form of cash or stock, up to a 50-50 level. The previous agreement was an all-stock deal, and Comcast's cash offer was seen as a significant enticement.Disney also plans to take on about $13.8 billion of Fox's net debt. That would lift the total transaction value above about $85 billion.Meanwhile, there's a separate — yet intertwined — fight for Sky, the British pay-TV company. Fox has attempted to acquire the portion of Sky that it doesn't already own, but Comcast swooped in with a higher bid.In any case, Comcast isn't likely to go away quietly.Comcast's current $65 billion cash offer for Fox — along with the potential Sky deal — was already expected to push its debt load to $170 billion, according to Moody's Investors Service. That leaves CEO Brian Roberts with some tough decisions.""The ball is now in Brian Roberts's court,"" Sweeney said.Walt Disney stock rose 1% before the open on the stock market today. 21st Century Fox, which will retain the Fox broadcasting channel, Fox News and some assets, leapt 6.5% to 47.60.

Hot new Chinese IPO iQiyi looked set to snap a huge four-week winning streak.Red Hat (RHT), the expert in open source business software, gapped well below the 50-day moving average and plunged 12% in huge turnover despite posting decent fiscal Q1 results (EPS up 24%, revenue up 20%). The big drop triggered a sell signal for new shareholders.Those who have a large profit cushion in the stock could afford to wait. Why?

The stock is also triggering a follow-on buy point by rebounding off its 10-week moving average near 20.29.That price level, as seen in a weekly chart, is above the integrated oil and gas firm's original breakout point of 18.76. On May 3, the stock broke out of a perfect 13-week cup with handle. To find the correct entry, add 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, or 18.66 + 10 cents.Marathon has ended a long drought on the bottom line with earnings of 7 cents and 18 cents a share in the past two quarters.

The cloud-based data storage play went public in March at 21 a share.Elsewhere, the Dow utility average rallied nearly 0.7% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond looks headed to finish below the critical 3% level for a fifth week in a row.At 695, the Dow utilities still lag the key equity indexes with a 4% loss since Jan. 1.RELATED: Three Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep Tumbling Inside The Big Picture: Is It Time To Sell Growth Stocks Now?The Latest Inside Investor's CornerDropbox Is One of The Current Names In IBD Leaderboard

Urban Outfitters stock eventually advanced to 48.24 on June 13.

150,CL,"The Nasdaq composite led the upside in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and wiping away the prior day's 0.3% decline. Meanwhile, Google owner Alphabet and PayPal are staging new breakouts, providing growth investors a set of new proper entry points.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose nearly 2% to 1,199.90, clearing a 1,178.26 buy point in a 4-1/2-month double bottom. This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern. This provided a slightly lower entry point at 1,161.20.PayPal (PYPL), noted in today's new IBD Stock of the Day column, rallied 2% to 86.14 and is still in buy range after clearing an 84.09 buy point in its double-bottom base.In a double bottom, a stock suffers two major sell-offs. The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good. It means that a strong shakeout of weak holders has occurred.The Nasdaq got as high as 7794, good for a new all-time high. The tech-rich composite has now extended its year-to-date gain to 12.9%.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on the strength of RV maker, drugstore chain, computer networking, movie, department store and medical software companies.

Shares are now up nearly 8%.Homebuilder, coal, diversified operations, fertilizer and soap stocks, however, fell 0.6% or more and weighed on the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost nearly 1.2% on Tuesday, traded virtually flat. The popular 30-stock average is trying to cling to its key 50-day moving average.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which is replacing General Electric (GE) in the Dow Jones industrials, is nowhere near a potential breakout to new highs. The stock jumped more than 5% to 67.74 in heavy trade but is more than 19% below 52-week highs. Walgreens also trades beneath its downward-sloping 200-day moving average, a sign of underperformance.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the next-generation payment provider sports a strong Composite Rating of 97 on a scale of 1 to 99. This means that in terms of fundamentals, stock price strength and depth of fund sponsorship, PayPal is superior to 97% of all companies in IBD's database.Walgreens, in contrast, holds a lowly 38 Composite. Shares also trade more than 30% below an August 2015 all-time high of 97.30. Watch to see if Walgreens' ratings improve over time.One thing going for the Deerfield, Ill., company: steady profit gains.Earnings per share have risen 7%, 4%, 13%, 22%, 16% and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.

151,CL,"Dropbox (DBX), Zscaler (ZS) and Carbon Black (CBLK) are new software IPO stocks that staged powerful breakouts earlier this month. But with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and now the Nasdaq composite retreating, these IPOs have given up all of their gains. Dropbox stock fell back into the 5% buy zone on Thursday, along with Zscaler and Carbon Black. Meanwhile, blistering China IPO stocks iQiyi (IQ) and Huya (HUYA) suffered double-digit declines Thursday.Dropbox stock closed below its buy point Friday, a big red flag. Zscaler and Carbon Black also undercut entry areas intraday. IQiyi and Huya continued to swing wildly, but still have most of their gains.Should you hold or cash out of these volatile stocks? That depends on your investing horizon and your conviction in these names. But you should have a plan. Here are investing guidelines to consider:If a top stock rises more than 10% from the buy point, you really don't want to see that double-digit gain turn into a loss.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDropbox blasted 24.5% from a 34.93 buy point, but has tumbled all the way to 35.69, losing 4.3% in Wednesday's stock market trading. Zscaler ran up 26% from its entry, also 34.93, but has since retreated to 35.21, diving 7.1% on Wednesday. Carbon Black vaulted 35% from a 25.94 entry. But it fell 26.67, off 7.5% on Thursday.On Friday, Dropbox sank 5.5% to 33.72, round-tripping its run. Zscaler fell to 34.25 intraday, round-tripping its run-up, though it did rebound to close up 4% at 36.63  Carbon Black sank 2% to 26.14 after falling as low as 25.69, just below its 25.94 entry.If a stock pulls back to a breakout area, does it find support at its buy point? Dropbox stock didn't seem to find support at the buy point. Zscaler stock did find support around its buy point, ultimately. So, to a lesser extent, did fellow security software IPO stock Carbon Black.While IPO stocks Dropbox, Zscaler and Carbon Black have fallen sharply, those sell-offs have come in volume that, though heavy, was generally lighter than on the run-up.Do you think this stock and company are going to be big long-term winners? Perhaps you let the stock pull back further. If it's a more speculative, short-term trade, you might be quicker to take partial or total profits.That's a question not only for the software IPO trio, but the Chinese livestreaming IPO duo of iQiyi and Huya.IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, tumbled 12% on Thursday. Huya, a YY (YY) spinoff, plunged nearly 14%. Both are sharply higher over the past several weeks. IQiyi stock and Huya stock had vaulted far above their fast-rising 10-day moving averages, so they were due for a pullback. On Thursday, Huya fell below its 10-day line for the first time ever, while iQiyi ended just above that line.Livestreaming is booming in China, and Huya has turned profitable. However, even if the future is bright for the livestreaming business, that's no guarantee that these two IPO stocks will be among the big long-term winners.If you are confident in these stocks, you might hold tight. Otherwise, you could trim or cash out your position.Huya stock fell 8% Friday morning, closing down 6.5%. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock sank 5.7% after plunging 9% earlier.Whatever your investing strategy, have a plan. How far are you willing to let a stock fall before you act? When a serious pullback occurs, follow your coolheaded strategy and not your emotions.Remember, if a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, that's an absolute sell signal.If a stock falls and you sell, you can always get back in when a new buying opportunity appears.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These Five 99 Composite Rating Stocks Are In, Near Buy ZonesWhy These Explosive China Stocks Are Due For PullbacksIf You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 5 Biotech IPOs Jump In Debuts

157,CL,"Nike (NKE) earnings and sales are due after the close Thursday, and the world's dominant athletic apparel brand will be expected to address the question of whether its primacy in North America is under any threat.Sales in the U.S. and Canada have declined, year over year, for the last three straight quarters. On the most recent Nike earnings call in March, Chief Executive Mark Parker pointed to a ""reversal of trend"" happening in the fourth quarter (the period to be reported on Thursday), an expected inflection point that comes as Nike rethinks its retail distribution and focuses on online commerce.Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Nike earnings to grow 7% to 64 cents, on an 8% increase in revenue to $9.39 billion.Within the North America segment, footwear sales have been leading declines. Nike has expressed confidence in its new products, however, including the VaporMax, Air Max 720 and Epic React, as it looks to fend off Adidas' (ADDYY) resurgence in recent years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""Adidas sees any proactive Nike distribution reduction as a windfall for them.""Shares were down 1.5% at 72.35 on the stock market today amid a broad market retreat sparked by fears of a spiraling trade war.

165,CL,"Talk-show host Oprah Winfrey once gave every member of her studio audience a new car. Winfrey, who recently signed a deal to make video programming for Apple (AAPL), could soon be pointing to the iPhone maker and shouting ""You get a car!""Apple has long been rumored to be working on a self-driving electric car, but the buzz has died down over the past year or so. Speculation shifted from Apple making its own vehicle, which some dubbed the iCar, to it making autonomous-car technology to supply to existing automakers.Guggenheim analyst Robert Cihra predicted Wednesday that Apple eventually will come out with its own car. In a report titled, ""The Ongoing Case for an Apple iCar,"" Cihra said the market opportunity is simply too large for Apple to ignore.""We believe Apple needs big new TAMs (total addressable markets) to keep growing and we reiterate our expectation that it ultimately launches a self-driving car, irrespective of contrary news flow and even its own hesitations to date,"" Cihra said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Apple has signed video content deals with Winfrey, filmmakers Steven Spielberg and M. Night Shyamalan, among others.Cihra reiterated his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 215. Apple shares rose 0.7% to 185.50 on the stock market today.The automotive business is one of few markets that could help Apple realize meaningful sales growth, he said.""Consensus is that Apple has pulled back on ambitions to launch a car and is now just focusing on autonomous tech to sell to others,"" he said. But Apple has never acted as a supplier of core technology to others. Its business model is to own and control the end-to-end experience, Cihra said.Apple has a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. It also has filed patents in autonomous vehicle control, guidance and navigation systems. There's also related neural networking, lidar detection, camera and machine vision systems. Plus, it has patents in vehicle climate control and body structure, Cihra said.""Given the market's sheer size and parallels to Apple's historical MO, we remain convinced that it will inevitably be drawn into launching its own car,"" Cihra said.Apple recently hired Jaime Waydo, lead systems engineer for Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google's Waymo self-driving cars. That follows the hiring in April of Google's former senior vice president of engineering, John Giannandrea. He will be Apple's new overall chief of machine learning and AI strategy, Cihra said.Even if self-driving cars ultimately sell more to fleet operators than consumers, the business would still be attractive to Apple, Cihra said.The New York Times reported last month that Apple is partnering with Volkswagen (VLKAY) to turn T6 Transporter vans into self-driving vehicles to shuttle around Apple's own employees.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Apple Challenges Mounting, Losing Ground With DevelopersApple To Spend $900 Million On Original Video Content This Year: Analyst

167,CL,"Investors may be overlooking a big factor in who wins the takeover battle for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) — whether the Murdoch family wants to be the biggest shareholders in the new company, or would they rather cash out?The question is the proverbial elephant-in-the-room as a bidding war rages between Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) for a chunk of Rupert Murdoch's Fox media empire. Fox on Wednesday accepted Disney's sweetened, $71 billion cash-and-stock bid, at $38-a-share. That countered Comcast's $65 billion all-cash bid. Experts expect Comcast to fire back soon.Murdoch, along with sons Lachlan and James — all three of them Fox board members — are legally bound recommend the best offer to shareholders. Whether Comcast or Disney prevails in the showdown over Fox likely boils down to the highest offer, tax issues and regulatory approval.But a lurking concern is whether Murdoch and family want to stay in the pantheon of the media and entertainment industry. Murdoch owns 17% of Fox's outstanding shares. The family stands to be the biggest shareholders in a combined Disney-Fox. It's possible a Murdoch one day could run Disney.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Murdochs, however, become smaller media industry players if Fox ultimately accepts Comcast's all-cash bid.Comcast and Disney are fighting over Fox's film and TV studios, cable networks, international TV business and a 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky. Not everything in Fox goes, however. Fox retains its news channel, TV stations, sports networks and other assets and spin it into a new company, with Lachlan Murdoch as CEO.It's not clear if the Murdochs will get a Disney board seat if the Mouse prevails vs. Comcast, says Blair Levin, analyst at New Street Research. The reason: Disney owns a TV broadcaster, ABC, and the Murdochs still would have Fox.Craig Moffett, a longtime industry analyst, on Thursday published a report saying Disney holds an edge over Comcast. He says Disney's mostly stock offer provides tax advantages. He notes that Fox shareholders have a choice of taking cash or stock. And, Moffett says Disney may have a better chance of getting regulatory approval, despite AT&T's (T) recent court victory in the Time Warner acquisition.Asked about Murdoch winding up as the biggest shareholder in Disney as a factor, Moffett replied in an email: ""Yes, that too.""Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday the company has legally committed to not split Fox assets with Comcast. That raises the stakes for the Roberts family.Ralph Roberts co-founded Comcast in the 1960s. A dual-class stock structure gives the Roberts family control of about a third of the company's voting power.Comcast stock dropped 1.8% to close at 32.79 on the stock market today as Fox rose 0.5% to 48.34.

180,CL,"Sellers still held the upper hand in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average fell between 0.6% and 0.7%. At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5% and is poised to make its first weekly loss after rising four weeks in a row. But New York Times defied the sell-off with a new breakout.Hot new China IPO iQiyi (IQ), meanwhile, sold off sharply. The video streaming firm fell more than 10% to 39.51, showing its biggest single-session point loss since breaking out of a narrow IPO base at 20.60.When stocks have made many months of gains and are in a climax run, that would be a sell signal. IQiyi's advance doesn't quite fit that profile, but its slide today is reason to take at least some profits in an offense-minded way.IQiyi also gave short-term traders a potential sell signal after the stock dipped below its 10-day moving average near 38.78 for the first time since its breakout. At one point, iQiyi fell as much as 14.5% to a session low of 37.80. You can see the 10-day moving average as a thin green line on a Leaderboard chart.Among fast-rising growth stocks, the 10-day line often acts as a better indicator of when a leader is ready to take a pause. When a stock has risen more than 10% from a proper buy point, then sharply undercuts the 10-day moving average, it can act as a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The small-cap S&P 600 did slightly worse than the major averages, falling roughly 0.8%. But at 1044, the S&P 600 continues to outmatch the S&P 500 in year-to-date gains, up 11.5% vs. a 3% advance since Jan. 1 for the large-cap benchmark.With less than hour to go in stocks today, volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly 5% lower on the NYSE.One small cap in the media space broke out. New York Times (NYT) rallied nearly 5% to hit a high of 26.50. Shares cleared a four-month flat base, a key chart pattern for growth stock investors, at 25.80 in average trade. The permissible buy zone goes up to 27.09.Buying too far extended in price puts an investor at higher risk of being shaken out during a normal pullback by the stock after it breaks out.According to IBD Stock Checkup, NYT's Composite Rating has improved to a respectable 86 on a scale of 1 to 99. Plus, that score is tops within the Media-Newspapers industry group. The next best company is New Media Investment Group (NEWM), owning a mediocre 71 Composite score.NYT logged an 8% increase in the top line to $1.68 billion in 2017. That marked only the second time in at least nine years that the company's sales increased on a year-over-year basis. More recently, NYT has shown a big turnaround in earnings.Profits grew 64%, 117%, 30% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Easy comparisons helped the cause. Revenue grew 9%, 6%, 10% and 4% over the same time frame. That falls well short of the C factor in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The best stocks tend to show earnings and sales increases of 25% or higher in recent quarters.New Media Investment recently broke out of a 10-week flat base with an 18.05 buy point. At 18.82, the small cap is 4% past that correct entry, or still within the proper buy zone.New Media has grown revenue by 18% and 11% in the prior two quarters, the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2016.Retail internet companies got thumped after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have broad authority to enforce the collection of sales taxes by online retail companies doing business in their jurisdiction. Stamps.com (STMP) slid more than 11% in quadruple normal share turnover and briefly undercut its 50-day moving average.Leaderboard name Etsy (ETSY), the global online marketplace for arts and crafts entrepreneurs, hit a new high of 45.88 but reversed to a 1.6% decline. Volume is running twice its 50-day average.Big declines in heavier than normal volume are a telltale sign of pronounced institutional selling.Etsy, which holds a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, has already rallied more than 45% since vaulting off its 50-day moving average near 29.18 in late May.Shares are also up more than 108% since clearing a cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21, one week after the market staged a Day 4 follow-through and signaled a new market uptrend was possibly in play.The automaker group fared among the 10 worst performers in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups.Ferrari (RACE) gapped lower at the open and skidded 2%. At 140.32, the maker of luxury sports cars is now slightly below a 141.66 buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA) fell nearly 3% but is still finding a floor of potential support at the 350 level. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer continue to sail well past its rising 50-day moving average, which has recently risen back above 300.The stock continues to work on a large first-stage base.While the Street sees the company losing $6.82 a share this year, it also expects Tesla to turn a profit of $2.52 a share in 2019.In other financial markets, investors bought back long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.90%.Ahead of the OPEC meeting on Friday in Vienna, Austria, WTI crude oil futures edged 0.1% lower to $65.62 a barrel.

If Google existed then, would its employees have demanded Google ""not be in the business of war""?Through force of arms, America was able to impose democracy and liberty on Japan.Through force of arms, America liberated Asian countries from the Nazi-like Japanese imperialists.Through force of arms, America enabled the majority of Koreans to live free rather than under the most totalitarian regime in modern history, North Korea.Through force of arms, Israel has survived 70 years of Arab, and now Iranian, attempts to annihilate it. Arms ended the Holocaust in Europe, and arms prevent a second Holocaust of Jews in the Middle East.Only a moral idiot does not understand the moral necessity of weapons of war being in the hands of decent countries.Which brings us to the second trait of Google and its employees: ingratitude.Google and its employees live better than almost any human beings in the world. They do so because they live in the freest and most opportunity-giving country in the world, the United States of America.That Google and its employees refuse to work on the military defense of their country is an expression of ingratitude (not to mention absence of patriotism) that is simply breathtaking.How did we produce such foolish and ungrateful people?They are the products of left-wing education and the left-wing media, and of living in the left-wing cocoon of Northern California and its tech industry.Google should be true to its convictions and change just one word of its original slogan from ""Don't be evil"" to ""Don't fight evil.""

China retaliated with tariffs of its own.In stock market results today, Canada Goose (GOOS) soared 33% on a big earnings and sales beat. Before the open, the company reported adjusted profit of 7 cents a share. Sales more than doubled from the year-ago quarter, rising 153% to $98.6 million.Other heavy-volume gainers included steel producer Schnitzer Steel (SCHN). Shares jumped more than 8% after the company raised its earnings guidance for the current quarter. Amid a lot of trade-war talk Friday, a 25% tariff on steel imports by the U.S. is already in place. Schnitzer Steel's price performance was impressive in light of a weak day for steel stocks overall.Meanwhile, a beat-and-raise quarter from Adobe Systems (ADBE) wasn't good enough as shares lost 2%. But the Nasdaq 100 name was well off lows in afternoon trading. Adobe was well-extended in price ahead of the results.

198,CL,"Sellers still held the upper hand in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average fell between 0.6% and 0.7%. At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5% and is poised to make its first weekly loss after rising four weeks in a row. But New York Times defied the sell-off with a new breakout.Hot new China IPO iQiyi (IQ), meanwhile, sold off sharply. The video streaming firm fell more than 10% to 39.51, showing its biggest single-session point loss since breaking out of a narrow IPO base at 20.60.When stocks have made many months of gains and are in a climax run, that would be a sell signal. IQiyi's advance doesn't quite fit that profile, but its slide today is reason to take at least some profits in an offense-minded way.IQiyi also gave short-term traders a potential sell signal after the stock dipped below its 10-day moving average near 38.78 for the first time since its breakout. At one point, iQiyi fell as much as 14.5% to a session low of 37.80. You can see the 10-day moving average as a thin green line on a Leaderboard chart.Among fast-rising growth stocks, the 10-day line often acts as a better indicator of when a leader is ready to take a pause. When a stock has risen more than 10% from a proper buy point, then sharply undercuts the 10-day moving average, it can act as a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The small-cap S&P 600 did slightly worse than the major averages, falling roughly 0.8%. But at 1044, the S&P 600 continues to outmatch the S&P 500 in year-to-date gains, up 11.5% vs. a 3% advance since Jan. 1 for the large-cap benchmark.With less than hour to go in stocks today, volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly 5% lower on the NYSE.One small cap in the media space broke out. New York Times (NYT) rallied nearly 5% to hit a high of 26.50. Shares cleared a four-month flat base, a key chart pattern for growth stock investors, at 25.80 in average trade. The permissible buy zone goes up to 27.09.Buying too far extended in price puts an investor at higher risk of being shaken out during a normal pullback by the stock after it breaks out.According to IBD Stock Checkup, NYT's Composite Rating has improved to a respectable 86 on a scale of 1 to 99. Plus, that score is tops within the Media-Newspapers industry group. The next best company is New Media Investment Group (NEWM), owning a mediocre 71 Composite score.NYT logged an 8% increase in the top line to $1.68 billion in 2017. That marked only the second time in at least nine years that the company's sales increased on a year-over-year basis. More recently, NYT has shown a big turnaround in earnings.Profits grew 64%, 117%, 30% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Easy comparisons helped the cause. Revenue grew 9%, 6%, 10% and 4% over the same time frame. That falls well short of the C factor in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The best stocks tend to show earnings and sales increases of 25% or higher in recent quarters.New Media Investment recently broke out of a 10-week flat base with an 18.05 buy point. At 18.82, the small cap is 4% past that correct entry, or still within the proper buy zone.New Media has grown revenue by 18% and 11% in the prior two quarters, the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2016.Retail internet companies got thumped after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have broad authority to enforce the collection of sales taxes by online retail companies doing business in their jurisdiction.

201,CL,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though. Shares plunged to their lowest level in three years on Amazon's deal to buy PillPack.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) cut its revenue guidance on currency headwinds but raised its EPS outlook on greater-than-expected operating efficiencies.Accenture (ACN) delivered a fiscal third-quarter earnings beat.

202,CL,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP. It's the largest market share payments platform in the online world. It's growing quarterly sales north of 20% and earnings around 30%. It has strong ROE.

205,CL,"Dow Jones futures were little changed late Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Donald Trump has approved a revised China tariffs list, according to multiple reports. Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped earnings views and guided higher, but its stock fell. AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) rose late as the Justice Department won't seek to stay Tuesday's court ruling blessing their merger. Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine. The S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped as energy and retail stocks slumped.Dow Jones futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. So were S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.President Donald Trump reportedly has approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with a revised list affected products. The official announcement will come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAdobe Systems earnings rose 63% vs. a year earlier to $1.66 a share, beating second-quarter views for $1.54. Revenue climbed 24% to $2.20 billion, modestly topping. The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours.

211,CL,"Dow Jones futures were little changed late Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Donald Trump has approved a revised China tariffs list, according to multiple reports. Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped earnings views and guided higher, but its stock fell. AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) rose late as the Justice Department won't seek to stay Tuesday's court ruling blessing their merger. Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine. The S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped as energy and retail stocks slumped.Dow Jones futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. So were S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.President Donald Trump reportedly has approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with a revised list affected products. The official announcement will come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect.

The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours. AT&T stock edged higher.During the regular session, Baidu (BIDU) spinoff iQiyi ran up nearly 17%, YY (YY) spinoff Huya jumped 13%, and Bilibili climbed 2.1%.

212,CL,"When you drink a cup of coffee, you can avoid getting burned badly by taking sips instead of just gulping it down.It's much the same in investing. If you find a stock with top-notch fundamentals and technicals, don't jump in all at once. Start by using a portion of your allotted capital for the trade and build up into a full position as the stock rises.This process of pyramiding a position is a way to enter a trade and at the same time reduce risk. Investors can use all of their allocated capital and buy their entire position at one time. But just be aware that while you can make more money this way, you can also quickly lose more money by going all-in.For example, if you use $10,000 to buy 200 shares of a $50 stock, all of your initial investment is at risk. If the stock falls 8% and you adhere to the golden rule of investing, you'd lose $800. If you started with half of a $10,000 position, or $5,000, you'd lose less if you were forced to cut losses at 8%.Pyramiding involves making multiple purchases to build your position. You can divide your purchases into three installments.For your first buy, use half of your maximum capital that you would allocate for a single stock investment. So if you have $10,000 to invest, use $5,000 for your initial position. Start things off right by buying a leader once it goes through the buy point of a proper base in volume that's at least 40% above average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOnly buy more shares if the stock moves 2% to 2.5% above your initial purchase price. If it does, use 30% of your allotted capital for your second buy. Now you're 80% invested.If the stock goes up another 2% to 2.5% from your second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your allocated capital for your final buy. Now you're fully invested and the stock is acting right.Pyramiding is smarter, as you're only putting more money to work after a stock has proven that it can go higher. What you are essentially doing is averaging up, the opposite of average down. The latter is often a losing proposition.On Oct. 12, 2010, more than a year after the March 2009 market bottom, Starbucks (SBUX) bolted past a 26.67 entry from a cup-with-handle base in about twice its average trade (1). An initial position that made up 50% of your designated full stake could havebeen put on there.A second buy could also have been established Oct. 12 — the same day as the breakout — or in the next few trading sessions as shares rose more than 2% past the 26.67 trigger.A final buy in Starbucks could have been made as early as Oct. 14 as it rallied 4% past the initial 26.67 buy point (2), near 27.74.The stock rose 25% by early January 2011 before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.Let's examine a more recent example in Shake Shack (SHAK). The fellow retail restaurant group member sprinted up to a peak of 96.75 in just 16 weeks after its NYSE debut in January 2015 at 21 a share. The stock then melted into a long, deep correction lasting years.But 2018 is a different story.The premium hamburger and shake chain broke out of an excellent 17-week cup with handle on April 26. The stock rallied 2.15, or 5%, to 45.40. Volume edged 13% above its 50-day average. The buy point was 44.50, a dime above the highest price within the handle.Let's say you wanted to invest $50,000 in Shake Shack. You could buy roughly $25,000 worth, or 560 shares, as soon as they hit a price of 44.50. Once the stock rallied 2.5% above the 44.50 correct buy point, or 45.61, then you could add another 330 shares.The time to do that? The next day, April 27.Shake Shack bolted 1.85 points, or 4.1%, and got as high as 47.50 intraday. That marked a new 52-week peak. Volume improved to a 69% jump vs. usual levels.Your total stake now: 890 shares, $39,971.30 deployed, average cost of $44.91 a share.The session on April 27 proved so strong that you could have completed the full position with the third buy of 215 shares at 46.73 apiece ($10,046.95).Three layers of goodness. Just five sessions later, Shake Shack rocketed up 18% and hit new multiyear highs following strong Q1 results (earnings up 50% on an adjusted basis, sales up 29% to a quarterly record of $99.1 million).Today, shares are trading around 64, up a beefy 41% from your average cost of $45.27 a share in the full position.(Editor's Note: A version of this article originally ran in the Jan. 24, 2012, edition of IBD.

215,CL,"A mixed week for IBD's Global Leaders list saw some mixed action in the past week, but a promising chart for Atlassian (TEAM).There were some heavy losses among China-based names, with Alibaba Group (BABA), ZTO Express (ZTO) and Huazhu Group (HTHT) carving deep declines as China's domestic markets staged a sharp pullback.At the other end of the spectrum, China-based IPO CLPS (CLPS) spiked about 50% for the week. That left the financial software provider more than 150% above its May 24 IPO price.The list's only other gains for the week came from stocks outside China: Mellanox (MLNX) and Orion Engineered Carbons (OEC). Both are extended from buy points.Among the week's more interesting chart action, software developer Atlassian — headquartered in the U.K. with its operations in Australia — added a tenth week to an unusual base pattern.Atlassian's cloud-based products help direct project-management and team collaboration within large companies and government agencies. IBD Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW) is a key competitor, as are Box (BOX) and the start up Slack. In addition, Microsoft (MSFT) entered the market in early 2017 with its own products. It moved more seriously into the space early this month with its $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub.Atlassian has also been an acquirer, paying $425 million for Trello in January last year. Analysts expect to see more deals.Despite the competition, consensus views see Atlassian earnings rising 33% this year and 40% in 2019. Revenue growth is projected at 34% and 30%, respectively, over the same two years.Atlassian shares are up about 42% so far this year. The advance has been saw-toothed, with many highs and lows, including a breakout attempt that failed in February. At the same time, the gains have been loosely cradled by the stock's 10-week moving average.The result sets up the perfect circumstances for an ascending base, considered to be a rare but bullish chart pattern. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.The result is a three-lobe base that forms over a nine-to-16 week period. Each grotto within the base forms higher highs and higher lows. The final high provides the position of the buy point.In Atlassian's case, the base began during the week ended April 20. The buy point is at 68.85. The stock has been trying to clear that entry but fell almost 5% early Friday, testing support at its 10-week moving average before paring losses to around 2%. That left shares down a bit more than 2% for the week.While the base is considered rare, IBD Leaderboard and Global Leaders stock Autohome (ATHM) broke out from an ascending base May 30 with a 107.64 buy point.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.By Thursday, Atlassian's relative strength line had leveled out at new highs. Its Accumulation/Distribution rating was a B-, suggesting institutions were buying moderately.RELATED:Autohome Stock 'Ascends' Into Buy Zone Via This Rare, Bullish BaseHow Atlassian Stacks Up Versus ServiceNow, Microsoft In EnterpriseAtlassian Bulls Focus On Customer Growth, Product InvestmentsInternet Tax Decision, OPEC Worries Spur Selling; Time To Sell Growth Stocks?Trade War Heats Up As EU Tariffs To Kick In: Investing Action Plan

That left it well above the 20% drop that defines a bear market.In response, U.S. investors have backed away from China-based names as indicators suggest things may get worse before U.S. trade strategy begins to bear any real fruit. U.S.-based stocks with China exposure also continue to suffer. Caterpillar (CAT) dropped more than 10% in June. Deere (DE) fell more than 5%. Boeing (BA) held to a loss of less than 4%.But the declines may also produce some opportunities worth watching. Two of those are IPOs.IQiyi dropped almost 11% for the week, its second steep weekly decline. The divot looks severe. But the pullback marked its low at 34.6% below its June 19 high. That leaves it within the 35% boundary of what is usually considered to be a normal pullback for cup-type bases. The stock remained up 57% since clearing an IPO base in May. But it has yet to form a standard base.The chart for another IPO, Huya (HUYA), looked similar at the end of the week. The pullback from its high was 41%, however. That means any base it builds will be a risky bet at breakout time.Financial IT services provider CLPS may be ready to form a base. The stock has nearly doubled since clearing an IPO base in mid-June.Baozun pulled back more than 10% for the week, but managed to keep close to its 10-week moving average. The stock could shape a base, or it could rebound from support at its 10-week line. In either case, Baozun's last breakout was from a third-stage base.

Bilibili and iQiyi both debuted in late March.And Huya, a livestreaming platform for gaming in China, went public on May 11 as a spinoff of YY (YY), which is also a livestreaming company. The stock has yet to take an official breather, never forming a proper IPO base along its run. Shares have risen 285% from the IPO price of 12.As iQiyi, Bilibili and Huya are young names in China's growing internet marketplace, their growth stories still seem to be in the early stages.

224,CL,"The Nasdaq composite led the upside in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and wiping away the prior day's 0.3% decline. Meanwhile, Google owner Alphabet and PayPal are staging new breakouts, providing growth investors a set of new proper entry points.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose nearly 2% to 1,199.90, clearing a 1,178.26 buy point in a 4-1/2-month double bottom. This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern. This provided a slightly lower entry point at 1,161.20.PayPal (PYPL), noted in today's new IBD Stock of the Day column, rallied 2% to 86.14 and is still in buy range after clearing an 84.09 buy point in its double-bottom base.In a double bottom, a stock suffers two major sell-offs. The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good. It means that a strong shakeout of weak holders has occurred.The Nasdaq got as high as 7794, good for a new all-time high. The tech-rich composite has now extended its year-to-date gain to 12.9%.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on the strength of RV maker, drugstore chain, computer networking, movie, department store and medical software companies.

Shares are now up nearly 8%.Homebuilder, coal, diversified operations, fertilizer and soap stocks, however, fell 0.6% or more and weighed on the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost nearly 1.2% on Tuesday, traded virtually flat. The popular 30-stock average is trying to cling to its key 50-day moving average.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which is replacing General Electric (GE) in the Dow Jones industrials, is nowhere near a potential breakout to new highs. The stock jumped more than 5% to 67.74 in heavy trade but is more than 19% below 52-week highs. Walgreens also trades beneath its downward-sloping 200-day moving average, a sign of underperformance.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the next-generation payment provider sports a strong Composite Rating of 97 on a scale of 1 to 99. This means that in terms of fundamentals, stock price strength and depth of fund sponsorship, PayPal is superior to 97% of all companies in IBD's database.Walgreens, in contrast, holds a lowly 38 Composite. Shares also trade more than 30% below an August 2015 all-time high of 97.30. Watch to see if Walgreens' ratings improve over time.One thing going for the Deerfield, Ill., company: steady profit gains.Earnings per share have risen 7%, 4%, 13%, 22%, 16% and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.

225,CL,"21st Century Fox (FOXA) accepted a sweetened, roughly $71 billion bid from Walt Disney (DIS) for its entertainment assets, dealing a blow to Comcast (CMCSA) efforts to acquire the business.The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December — and $3 above Comcast's bid from last week. The new agreement also offers more flexibility and other enhancements than the Comcast offer, Fox said on Wednesday.At stake is a trove of media properties, ranging from ""The Simpsons"" to ""X-Men,"" that may help fend off the threat from Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming upstarts. Both Disney and Comcast are looking to use the Fox assets to bolster their content and expand overseas.Disney's latest offer is a ""very aggressive move"" by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and may make it difficult for Comcast to respond, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Sweeney. Comcast's current bid was already poised to load the company up with debt, and its shares have fallen 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Comcast's balance sheet may preclude it from bidding much higher,"" Sweeney said. ""Further hampering Comcast's ability to respond is its position that it does not want to use its stock in a deal at these low levels.""The AT&T EffectThe tussle follows the AT&T (T) victory over the Justice Department in its antitrust battle to take over Time Warner. That outcome is expected to spur a wave of media consolidation, emboldening companies to get more aggressive with deals.The Disney-Comcast contest will determine who controls much of Rupert Murdoch's empire, including Fox's movie and TV studios, television networks such as FX, and multichannel providers like Star India and Sky Plc.But the two sides aren't vying for all of Fox. Part of the business will be used to create an entity called ""New Fox,"" which will include the highly lucrative Fox News, the sports channels FS1 and FS2, and the Fox broadcasting channel. That operation will be run by Lachlan Murdoch and focus on domestic television, news and sports.Disney's new offer gives Fox shareholders the option to take their payment in the form of cash or stock, up to a 50-50 level. The previous agreement was an all-stock deal, and Comcast's cash offer was seen as a significant enticement.Disney also plans to take on about $13.8 billion of Fox's net debt. That would lift the total transaction value above about $85 billion.Meanwhile, there's a separate — yet intertwined — fight for Sky, the British pay-TV company. Fox has attempted to acquire the portion of Sky that it doesn't already own, but Comcast swooped in with a higher bid.In any case, Comcast isn't likely to go away quietly.Comcast's current $65 billion cash offer for Fox — along with the potential Sky deal — was already expected to push its debt load to $170 billion, according to Moody's Investors Service. That leaves CEO Brian Roberts with some tough decisions.""The ball is now in Brian Roberts's court,"" Sweeney said.Walt Disney stock rose 1% before the open on the stock market today. 21st Century Fox, which will retain the Fox broadcasting channel, Fox News and some assets, leapt 6.5% to 47.60.

226,CL,"The bear market is back in China, but should that matter to U.S. investors? On Friday, the Shanghai Composite dropped to 20.9% off its Jan. 29 high. Traditionally a 20% decline is the definition of a bear market.IBD's Stock Spotlight screen offers a partial answer to the who-cares question. Going into Tuesday's session, only one China-based stock made the screen: Alibaba (BABA).Earlier this year, as the Shanghai peaked, as much as 25% of the Spotlight lineup was China-based stocks.Individual investors might argue that the 2015-16 bear market in China meant little to U.S. investors. From a peak in June 2015 to a low in January 2016, the Shanghai Composite lost about half of its value. Meanwhile, U.S. indexes dropped less than 10% in the same period.Still, a decline is nothing to cheer about, especially since circumstances today are different.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn the 2015-16 China bear market, the chief bearish driver was slowing economic growth in China. Now President Trump's trade war is the chief catalyst.Let's take a look at the nine China-based stocks that have made the Spotlight screen at least once this year. What can their relative absence tell us now?No. 1: Online marketplace Alibaba is 10% off its high, not bad vs. the Shanghai's 20% drop. Yet the stock lost its 10-week moving average Monday. China is trying to shift to a more consumer-based economy and Alibaba could benefit from those efforts.No. 2: Tutoring center operator TAL Education (TAL) has made the Spotlight screen for more weeks this year than any other China stock. But after hitting a new high June 12, the stock has fallen 21% off its high. The last few bases were late-stage patterns.No. 3: Express delivery provider ZTO Express (ZTO) is 9% off its high. Action appears normal, even positive. The 2016 IPO recently found support at its 10-week line. The up-down volume ratio is a bullish 2.1, above the neutral 1.0 level.No. 4: Hotel chain Huazhu Group (HTHT) is 11% off its high after trimming gains from its May 15 breakout. The relative strength line, which measures a stock's price movement vs. the S&P 500, is bending south.No. 5: Solar-related stock Daqo New Energy (DQ) is 51% off its high. Both the 10-week and 40-week lines have been lost.No. 6: Social networking platform Weibo (WB) is 35% off its high. It hasn't made the Spotlight screen since March.No. 7: E-commerce solutions provider Baozun (BZUN) is finding support at its 10-week line. This is the first trip to the line since Baozun broke out in May.No. 8: Online marketplace 58.com (WUBA) lost its 10-week line this week. The stock is 19% off its high.No. 9: Health care services company iKang Healthcare Group (KANG) is 1% off its high. The company has agreed to a merger.What can investors learn from the Spotlight lineup?Many of the above China-based stocks carry seriously damaged charts.ZTO's chart is probably the most promising for two reasons. First, it's newest to the Spotlight lineup, having appeared in two of the past four weeks. Second, it is holding above its 10-week line.ZTO could be a watch list candidate. If the Shanghai Composite can find a bottom and rise, and the U.S. indexes can shake off their problems, ZTO could become a winner.RELATED:Trump Threatens Harley-DavidsonIs Stock Market About To Relive 1930?Stocks That Are Showing Relative Strength?MarketSmith: 3 Weeks For $19.95

With regard to morality, such people are fools.The United States has been the greatest force for liberty and goodness in world history. It has been so by modeling a free society and through the power of the idea of freedom, and even more so by force — brute physical force.Through force of arms, America and its allies defeated Germany in World War I and World War II.Through force of arms, America imposed democracy and liberty on West Germany and led to the dissolution of East Germany.Through force of arms, the Holocaust — the genocide of Europe's Jews and millions of others in Nazi concentration and death camps — ended. If Google existed then, would its employees have demanded Google ""not be in the business of war""?Through force of arms, America was able to impose democracy and liberty on Japan.Through force of arms, America liberated Asian countries from the Nazi-like Japanese imperialists.Through force of arms, America enabled the majority of Koreans to live free rather than under the most totalitarian regime in modern history, North Korea.Through force of arms, Israel has survived 70 years of Arab, and now Iranian, attempts to annihilate it. Arms ended the Holocaust in Europe, and arms prevent a second Holocaust of Jews in the Middle East.Only a moral idiot does not understand the moral necessity of weapons of war being in the hands of decent countries.Which brings us to the second trait of Google and its employees: ingratitude.Google and its employees live better than almost any human beings in the world. They do so because they live in the freest and most opportunity-giving country in the world, the United States of America.That Google and its employees refuse to work on the military defense of their country is an expression of ingratitude (not to mention absence of patriotism) that is simply breathtaking.How did we produce such foolish and ungrateful people?They are the products of left-wing education and the left-wing media, and of living in the left-wing cocoon of Northern California and its tech industry.Google should be true to its convictions and change just one word of its original slogan from ""Don't be evil"" to ""Don't fight evil.""

233,CL,"China growth stocks withered and Wall Street felt more selling pressure Wednesday as concerns over potential tariffs imposed on goods between the U.S. and its trading partners weighed on stocks today. The Nasdaq composite led with 1.5% decline, while the S&P 500 dropped almost 0.9%.Volume rose on both exchanges, according to early data. That signaled strong propensity among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like to anxiously sell equities and raise cash.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) almost resisted the overall decline, edging less than 0.2% lower and outperforming the market. The relative strength has come at an important time. Earlier this week, the iPhone and iPad giant sold off hard and closed beneath its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly two months.At 184.16, the megacap tech remains mildly above a 179.04 entry in a narrow and shallow double-bottom base. Therefore, for now, this is one reason why the leading tech stock can still be held by those who bought at the most recent proper buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average performed relatively better, losing just 0.7%, while the small-cap S&P 600 slid 1.4%. Yet at 1018, the S&P 600's 8.9% advance since Jan. 1 still sharply outperforms a less than 1% gain for the S&P 500.Breadth was severely negative as losing stocks outmatched winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-1 ratio. On the NYSE, losers beat winners by a 5-2 margin.Meanwhile, crude oil jumped sharply. U.S. near-term futures gaining 2.6% to $72.38 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield dropped 6 basis points to 2.82%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

At 28,356, the Hang Seng is now down 5.2% year to date.Sector Leader play Baozun (BZUN) slumped more than 7% and sliced through its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. The stock gave back all of a solid double-digit gain after breaking out of a seven-week base at 52.43.Baidu (BIDU) slumped for a fifth day in six sessions, falling more than 3% to 243.10 and closing back below the long-term 200-day moving average.Since the start of the year, the Chinese search engine has traced a series of higher highs and higher lows, but the severe choppiness has made it difficult for investors who have tried to buy Baidu shares on a breakout.Baidu announced plans to buy back as much as $1 billion worth of its common shares. The company's market value is nearly $85 billion.Plenty of other Chinese growth stocks got hammered.Autohome (ATHM), a former Leaderboard name, sharply undercut its 50-day moving average and issued a key defensive sell signal. Shares fell nearly 8% to 97.51 in volume that grew 169% above average.The 50-day moving average, painted as a red line in IBD's daily charts, had contained no fewer than five pullbacks by Autohome since early February.Therefore, Wednesday's big cut of the 50-day line showed a bearish change in character in the leading stock.The online marketing firm for the Chinese vehicle market had vaulted out of a double-bottom base at 66.55 on Jan. 2. It ultimately rallied 79% before sliding into its current price correction.Apple has not made much price progress compared with 2017, when it cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6 of that year. That cup with handle was not only first stage, but also served as a bottoming-base chart pattern after the stock's lengthy decline. Shares have risen 64% since then.However, the stock has continued to trace a slow yet steady uptrend while finding buying support at the key 10- and 40-week moving averages.Plus, the fundamental picture still looks bright. Earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter are forecast to grow 31% to $2.18 a share. That would mark acceleration from EPS gains of 2%, 11%, 18%, 24%, 16% and 30% in the prior six quarters.On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple and arch rival Samsung of South Korea settled a years-long technology patent infringement suit in a U.S. district court in Northern California. Terms were not disclosed in the court filing.Also, earlier this week, the Economic Times of India reported that Apple plans to boost production of certain iPhone models in the South Asian country in a bid to lower costs.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's SMR Rating has risen to a top-drawer A grade on a scale of A to E. This proprietary rating focuses on sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity.A handful of companies staged breakouts, but their finishes lacked oomph.Kemet (KEM), part of the IBD 50, attempted a breakout from a long, deep cup with handle that showed a 25.79 buy point. Shares got as high as a 3.7% gain to 26.33 before cooling off and falling 15 cents to 25.23. Volume jumped 54% above usual levels.The drop within Kemet's cup base, a 49.8% slide from a 27.35 high to 13.73 at the bottom, is way more than the acceptable limit of 33% to 35% corrections in a normal cup with handle.However, keep in mind that the stock ramped up from as low as 1.26 in early 2016, a 2,070% gain until it carved the latest base. In some cases, a leading stock can build such a deep base, break out properly, and keep running to new highs.Outstanding fundamentals going forward usually factor into the story.Kemet, an expert in capacitors for electronics manufacturers, has grown its earnings per share 44%, 175%, 250%, 450%, 246%, 373% and 221% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.That kind of blistering growth is not likely to continue. But the Street sees earnings in the fiscal first-quarter ending in June rising a healthy 39% to 46 cents a share.Despite Wednesday's negative reversal, Kemet hasn't yet triggered the golden rule of investing.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, buy points, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningThe Stock Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Key Sell SignalThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerSector LeadersCan You Spot The Next Major Market Top?

234,CL,"A Wall Street analyst on Tuesday initiated coverage of Spotify Technology (SPOT) with the equivalent of a neutral rating, saying the streaming music leader has limited upside.Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein started Spotify at a perform rating and estimated that the stock has a value range of 160 to 170. Spotify stock rose 1.7% to 180.43 on the stock market today.Spotify went public on April 3, ending its first day at 149.01. It hit an all-time high of 182.45 on June 22.Spotify will have a hard time differentiating itself from rivals such as Apple (AAPL) Music because it offers the same catalog of songs, Helfstein said. It also has limited leverage with the music labels to negotiate for better terms that could improve its profitability, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe big three music labels are Vivendi's (VIVHY) Universal Music Group, the Sony Music Entertainment division of Japanese conglomerate Sony (SNE), and Warner Music Group, a division of privately held Access Industries. They, along with Merlin, a representative of many independent labels, control access to most music today with a catalog of 35 million tracks.Spotify is the leader in subscription-streaming music services today, but the relationship between scale and success is not as well defined in the sector as it is in other internet businesses, he said.Scale has translated to market dominance for firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Airbnb, he said.""Their leadership is a positive feedback loop as content/product availability increases proportionally to consumer demand,"" Helfstein said. ""We see no such force in music streaming because supply has no relationship to demand.""The music streaming market ultimately will be shared by a few scaled players, he said. Some like Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have other businesses that can create cross-selling opportunities using music services.Spotify ended the March quarter with 75 million paying subscribers. It also had 99 million monthly active users of its free, ad-supported service in the first quarter.Oppenheimer predicts that Spotify can reach 218 million paying subscribers by 2024. It sees Spotify growing to 250 million ad-supported users in the same period.RELATED:Apple Music, Video Could Become Meaningful Earnings DriversShould Spotify Join FANG Group Of Big Internet Stocks?Spotify Gets First Sell Rating As Comparisons To Netflix Don't Hold Up

The relative strength line made a new high as well, a good sign for the breakout. Archrock (AROC) rose past the 12.50 entry of a cup with handle.

246,CL,"The Nasdaq composite led the upside in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and wiping away the prior day's 0.3% decline. Meanwhile, Google owner Alphabet and PayPal are staging new breakouts, providing growth investors a set of new proper entry points.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose nearly 2% to 1,199.90, clearing a 1,178.26 buy point in a 4-1/2-month double bottom. This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern. This provided a slightly lower entry point at 1,161.20.PayPal (PYPL), noted in today's new IBD Stock of the Day column, rallied 2% to 86.14 and is still in buy range after clearing an 84.09 buy point in its double-bottom base.In a double bottom, a stock suffers two major sell-offs. The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good.

Walgreens also trades beneath its downward-sloping 200-day moving average, a sign of underperformance.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the next-generation payment provider sports a strong Composite Rating of 97 on a scale of 1 to 99. This means that in terms of fundamentals, stock price strength and depth of fund sponsorship, PayPal is superior to 97% of all companies in IBD's database.Walgreens, in contrast, holds a lowly 38 Composite. Shares also trade more than 30% below an August 2015 all-time high of 97.30. Watch to see if Walgreens' ratings improve over time.One thing going for the Deerfield, Ill., company: steady profit gains.Earnings per share have risen 7%, 4%, 13%, 22%, 16% and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.

252,CL,"Stock futures flattened, then fell in early premarket trade Wednesday, as markets continued to seek a foothold after Monday's global sell-off.The IBD 50 list and other leading stocks continued to show resilience in premarket action. Stocks including Five Below (FIVE) and Kemet (KEM) were set to open on Wednesday either in buy range or below buy points. Sonic (SONC) and AeroVironment (AVAV) dived late Tuesday after reporting quarterly results after the close. Oil prices closed at five-week highs, and are likely to be active during Wednesday's session.Nasdaq futures slipped 0.5% ahead of Wednesday's open. Dow industrials traded 0.4% below fair value and S&P 500 futures were down 0.3%.Oil prices could factor into Wednesday's market session, after comments from the U.S. State Department, and supply disruptions in Libya and Canada sent U.S. benchmark oil up more than 3% on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate crude traded up 0.9% early Wednesday, topping $71 per barrel, and at its highest level since May 22. Europe's Brent crude gaoined 0.7%, trading just below $77.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOilPrice.com reported that Libya's oil ports were no longer controlled by the Libyan National Army, but by the unofficial National Oil Corporation, which is affiliated with the country's eastern government based in Benghazi. In addition, a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers must cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who fail to respect the rule will face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey, according to Bloomberg.Oil also received a late boost after the American Petroleum Institute released data showing U.S. oil inventories decreased by more than 9.2 million barrels during the week ended June 22. Economists projected a 2.57 million-barrel decrease. Official weekly crude storage data are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.Despite the choppy market, plenty of IBD 50 names ended trade on Tuesday well-positioned for acquisitive investors. Among those, kid-friendly dollar store Five Below ended Tuesday's session less than 3% below a 104.09 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The IBD Leaderboard name scored a 22% breakaway gap on June 7, after crushing first-quarter expectations. Shares consolidated just below their June 13 high, completing a three-weeks-tight pattern on Friday. The June 7 breakout was from a third-stage base. That puts Five Below in late-stage territory, which adds some risk of failure to any further breakout attempts.While the Dow Jones industrial average has lost ground steadily since June 12, Kemet completed the right side of a base and added a handle for good measure. The handle presents a buy point at 25.79, and the stock traded less than 2% below that entry at Tuesday's close. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based maker of capacitors used in auto, telecom and aerospace applications has a best-possible EPS Rating of 99 from IBD. And its relative strength line is nearing new highs, a sign of strength before a breakout.Two other watchlist-worthy IBD 50 names are HealthEquity (HQY) and Mastercard (MA).  Both stocks are in industries largely unaffected by concerns over the U.S.-China trade brawl. Both remained extended after breakouts.HealthEquity was 5% above its 50-day moving average. Mastercard was 3% above its line. A touch back and rebound from that level of support would create a buying opportunity in both cases.AeroVironment ground out a 6% loss after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain eked past the consensus target. The maker of remote-controlled drones broke out past a 61.25 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume during regular trade on Tuesday.Drive-in burger joint Sonic slunk 9% lower. The Oklahoma City, Okla.-based chain reported fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings narrowly above analyst consensus targets. Same-store-sales and drive-in margins declined, and management trimmed is full-year earnings guidance. Sonic shares are extended, up 29% from a June 7 breakout.General Mills (GIS) and Paychex (PAYX) report results Wednesday morning.

259,CL,"General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo and Intel (INTC) lead auto and tech companies pouring big bucks into self-driving cars. But consumers aren't buying into this new technology.XThere are two key numbers to consider: Car buyers say they are willing to pay $2,300 for autonomous-vehicle features. But current AV systems cost around $22,900 — nearly 10 times more. That's according to a recent AlixPartners study.That actually underestimates the cost of autonomous vehicles. AVs being developed generally are all-electric or hybrids, adding several thousand dollars above the cost of a gas-powered vehicle.Those figures help explain why automakers have placed their AV bets on shared, commercial services, known as robotaxis, rather than sales to individual consumers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGlobally, companies are pouring more than $60 billion into AV investments. They're also spending $255 billion to develop electric vehicles over the next eight years, up from $25 billion over the past eight years, the AlixPartners report said. Yet ""EV costs are still years away from being competitive,"" it  added.The study authors warned that ""a pileup of epic proportions"" awaits the auto industry, with steep investments coming as the auto market slows. They added that autonomy and electrification represent both opportunity and risks.GM stock fell 2.7% in Friday's stock market trading, closing below their 50-day moving average.

Now GM is said to be considering a Cruise IPO.The No. 1 U.S. automaker plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service next year.

GM has said its driverless-car service will deliver 20%-30% margins by 2025.But GM, Waymo and other would-be robotaxi service providers must overcome riders' safety concerns. Indeed, the new AlixPartners Global Automotive Outlook report, released on June 20, found more than half (56%) of consumers are not confident that self-driving vehicles can safely navigate people.

Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though. Shares plunged to their lowest level in three years on Amazon's deal to buy PillPack.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) cut its revenue guidance on currency headwinds but raised its EPS outlook on greater-than-expected operating efficiencies.Accenture (ACN) delivered a fiscal third-quarter earnings beat. The global IT services firm has been making acquisitions to push into digital, cloud and cybersecurity products.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) rose as the FDA approved its cannabis-based drug, Epidiolex, to treat two seizure disorders.WWE (WWE) stock exploded after it pinned down bigger-than-expected deals with 21st Century Fox (FOX) and Comcast (CMCSA) to broadcast its shows.Boeing (BA) stock flashed a sell signal after China ""firmed up"" commitments to purchase jets from European rival Airbus (EADSY) amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Boeing went on to seesaw throughout the week, and remained marooned below its 50-day moving average.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

265,CL,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

Fed policymakers see two more hikes in 2018 after raising rates on Wednesday.A federal judge OK'd the AT&T-Time Warner deal without conditions, rejecting the Justice Department's argument that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry. AT&T closed the $85 billion merger on Friday. The landmark ruling boosted share prices in media firms CBS (CBS), Lionsgate (LGF), and Discovery Communications (DISCA). The decision is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media firms by telecom giants. The deal also bodes well for big vertical health care mergers, including CVS Health (CVS) buying Aetna (AET).Comcast (CMSCA), as expected, launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company, a 19% premium over the Walt Disney (DIS) offer. Disney in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in stock. Fox's board is expected to withdraw its recommendation for Disney's offer.

EA and Activision cleared buy zones while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) broke out.The Fed hiked its key interest rate, as expected, for the second time this year. Somewhat surprisingly, policymakers penciled in two more hikes this year. Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economy to be in ""great shape,"" and expressed no sense that the a hawkish shift in policy would be any risk.May retail sales rose 0.8%, their best gain in six months, backing up Powell's assessment. That spurred some Wall Street firms to boost second-quarter GDP growth projections to 4% or more. Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation picked up to 2.2% from a year ago, the highest since early 2017, and further increases are likely.Adobe Systems (ADBE) earned an adjusted $1.66 a share in its fiscal Q2, up 63% year over year, on sales of $2.20 billion, up 24%. Analysts expected the Digital media and marketing software firm to earn an adjusted $1.54 a share on sales of $2.16 billion. For its current fiscal third quarter, Adobe guided modestly higher.

277,CL,"When you drink a cup of coffee, you can avoid getting burned badly by taking sips instead of just gulping it down.It's much the same in investing. If you find a stock with top-notch fundamentals and technicals, don't jump in all at once. Start by using a portion of your allotted capital for the trade and build up into a full position as the stock rises.This process of pyramiding a position is a way to enter a trade and at the same time reduce risk. Investors can use all of their allocated capital and buy their entire position at one time. But just be aware that while you can make more money this way, you can also quickly lose more money by going all-in.For example, if you use $10,000 to buy 200 shares of a $50 stock, all of your initial investment is at risk. If the stock falls 8% and you adhere to the golden rule of investing, you'd lose $800. If you started with half of a $10,000 position, or $5,000, you'd lose less if you were forced to cut losses at 8%.Pyramiding involves making multiple purchases to build your position. You can divide your purchases into three installments.For your first buy, use half of your maximum capital that you would allocate for a single stock investment. So if you have $10,000 to invest, use $5,000 for your initial position. Start things off right by buying a leader once it goes through the buy point of a proper base in volume that's at least 40% above average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOnly buy more shares if the stock moves 2% to 2.5% above your initial purchase price. If it does, use 30% of your allotted capital for your second buy. Now you're 80% invested.If the stock goes up another 2% to 2.5% from your second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your allocated capital for your final buy. Now you're fully invested and the stock is acting right.Pyramiding is smarter, as you're only putting more money to work after a stock has proven that it can go higher. What you are essentially doing is averaging up, the opposite of average down. The latter is often a losing proposition.On Oct. 12, 2010, more than a year after the March 2009 market bottom, Starbucks (SBUX) bolted past a 26.67 entry from a cup-with-handle base in about twice its average trade (1). An initial position that made up 50% of your designated full stake could havebeen put on there.A second buy could also have been established Oct. 12 — the same day as the breakout — or in the next few trading sessions as shares rose more than 2% past the 26.67 trigger.A final buy in Starbucks could have been made as early as Oct. 14 as it rallied 4% past the initial 26.67 buy point (2), near 27.74.The stock rose 25% by early January 2011 before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.Let's examine a more recent example in Shake Shack (SHAK). The fellow retail restaurant group member sprinted up to a peak of 96.75 in just 16 weeks after its NYSE debut in January 2015 at 21 a share. The stock then melted into a long, deep correction lasting years.But 2018 is a different story.The premium hamburger and shake chain broke out of an excellent 17-week cup with handle on April 26. The stock rallied 2.15, or 5%, to 45.40. Volume edged 13% above its 50-day average. The buy point was 44.50, a dime above the highest price within the handle.Let's say you wanted to invest $50,000 in Shake Shack. You could buy roughly $25,000 worth, or 560 shares, as soon as they hit a price of 44.50. Once the stock rallied 2.5% above the 44.50 correct buy point, or 45.61, then you could add another 330 shares.The time to do that? The next day, April 27.Shake Shack bolted 1.85 points, or 4.1%, and got as high as 47.50 intraday. That marked a new 52-week peak. Volume improved to a 69% jump vs. usual levels.Your total stake now: 890 shares, $39,971.30 deployed, average cost of $44.91 a share.The session on April 27 proved so strong that you could have completed the full position with the third buy of 215 shares at 46.73 apiece ($10,046.95).Three layers of goodness. Just five sessions later, Shake Shack rocketed up 18% and hit new multiyear highs following strong Q1 results (earnings up 50% on an adjusted basis, sales up 29% to a quarterly record of $99.1 million).Today, shares are trading around 64, up a beefy 41% from your average cost of $45.27 a share in the full position.(Editor's Note: A version of this article originally ran in the Jan. 24, 2012, edition of IBD.

298,CL,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months.

In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon.

303,CL,"Digital payments firm PagSeguro Digital (PAGS) made an appearance in IBD's Sector Leaders screen late Friday — and for good reason. The company is an earnings and revenue powerhouse with strong growth prospects. But shares were volatile Wednesday after the company reported earnings.PagSeguro delivered another quarter of strong growth. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 133% from the year-ago quarter. Sales increased 98% to $279.2 million.Shares reversed higher in afternoon trade Wednesday after falling nearly 9% intraday, but its technical picture is still suspect. The stock is still about 15% off its high and below the 10-week moving average.PagSeguro had a great week last week, rising nearly 10% in higher volume, but shares slumped 10% Tuesday. Brazil-based stocks were weak across the board Tuesday, hurt by an ongoing truckers strike that has crippled Latin America's largest economy.It's been a rocky road for PagSeguro after its January IPO. The company raised $2.3 billion, offering 105.4 million shares at 21.50. It opened at 28.20 and closed at 29.20 on its first day of trading. After a modest pullback, the stock cleared a well-formed IPO base with a 30.02 buy point. The breakout performed well until shares got volatile in March.Keep in mind that even after its latest pullback, PagSeguro still sells at a premium valuation, based on its past four quarters of earnings as well as future estimates.At one point Wednesday, the stock was selling at 60 times trailing earnings and 37 times forward earnings. That's still considered pricey by standard valuation metrics. But growth investors would argue that the valuation is warranted due to bright growth prospects. Either way, high-multiple stocks like this are always held to a high standard around earnings.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

314,CL,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

329,CL,"IBD Leaderboard play Netflix and other FAANG stocks helped the Nasdaq limit losses in stocks today after the Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates for the second time this year.The U.S. central bank has now raised the cost of borrowing money by a quarter point for the seventh time since it began doing so in December 2015.The Nasdaq composite gained around 0.3% and hit new all-time highs Wednesday before cooling off on the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement.In its statement, the FOMC committee expressed confidence that the U.S. economy is growing stronger, as ""activity has been rising at a solid rate."" In the Fed's May 2 news release, the central bank noted that the U.S. economy was rising at ""a moderate rate.""At the session high of 7748, the index has now marched 12.2% higher since Jan. 1. On IBD Leaderboard, the year-to-date gains have been steeper.Lululemon (LULU), which initially joined the Leaders list on Leaderboard on Feb. 7, has jumped 61% since Jan. 1. Shares in the premium-priced yogawear and sports apparel firm have also ramped up more than 50% since it roared off the 10-week moving average in late March, triggering a buy signal. On Wednesday, the stock backtracked into slightly negative territory after rising 1.9% to as high as 127.34.Fast-growing Etsy (ETSY) and Five Below (FIVE), two more consumer spending-oriented names on Leaderboard, have also scored market-smashing gains.The S&P 500 fell 0.2% as declines in wood products, homebuilding, mortgage service, paper, auto parts, department store and oil and gas machinery stocks offset strength in wholesale drug supply, movie, gaming software, drugstore chain and computer networking firms.The Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones utility average fell fractionally, but at 665 the sector index has dropped more than 8% so far this year. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose 3 basis points to 2.99%, still below its May 17 peak of 3.11%.Volume is running sharply higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Going back to Netflix, shares bolted more than 4% higher and got as high as 384.25. Volume is running at a 127% faster than usual pace after Goldman Sachs reportedly boosted its long-term price target to $490 from $390. Analyst Heath Terry forecast that in 2019 the video streaming firm would garner 32.5 million net new subscribers. That well exceeds Wall Street's consensus estimate of 26 million net new adds.The very best companies in terms of fundamentals and stock price strength are able to launch breakouts from third, fourth, and even fifth stage bases. But later-stage bases always carry a higher risk of failure and a significant price correction.Netflix hauled out of a first-stage base at 107.07 in October 2016, then broke out again in the week ended July 21, 2017. Shares cleared a 166.97 buy point in a six-week cuplike base, then ramped up more than 20% before forming a third-stage base.More recently, Netflix surpassed a 338.92 follow-on entry point after testing support at the 10-week moving average in both March and April.In the year 2009, Netflix scored $1.67 billion in annual revenue. Last year, the top line grew 32% vs. the prior year to $11.69 billion. So over the past eight years, Netflix's revenue has not only risen 600%, but it's also achieved a compounded annual growth rate of 27%.Earnings have climbed from 28 cents a share to $1.25 over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see the Los Gatos, Calif., company growing earnings 129% this year to $2.86 a share on a 38% jump in revenue to $16.1 billion.The Street also sees Netflix's top line shattering the $20 billion barrier in 2019.Other FAANG stocks continue to act well.Alphabet (GOOGL) edged up 0.2% for a third up day in a row. The Google search engine owner has formed a seven-day handle on its new double bottom.In Alphabet's double bottom base, the second sell-off took shares down to 984, undercutting the early February sell-off low of 997.An undercut of the first low is good action within this type of base, and the middle peak in between the two sell-offs plus 10 cents offers a standard buy point.So in Alphabet's case, the buy point of 1,178.26 offers a proper entry for growth investors. But the new downward slanting handle, formed in light volume, offers a lower buy point at 1,161.20.Microsoft (MSFT), part of the so-called ""FAAMG"" megacap tech clan, continues to inch higher and is near new highs. At 101.33, the cloud computing, business software and computer and video game console giant remains within the 5% buy zone after a breakout past 97.34 in a six-week flat base.In the March-ended fiscal third quarter, Microsoft posted a 16% boost in earnings to 95 cents a share. That's on top of a 30% increase in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 revenue accelerated 16% to $26.82 billion. That marked the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 14 quarters.In other stocks today, TAL Education (TAL), ranking No. 9 in the IBD 50, fell sharply on reports that short selling firm Muddy Waters said it's sold shares short. The Carson Block-led firm reportedly accused the for-profit school operator of overstating its earnings from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, ended in February that year.The stock slumped as much 16% to a session low of 38.41 before recouping some of those losses. The stock undercut the 50-day moving average but quickly gained institutional buying support.On May 10, TAL broke out of a six-week cup without handle, but heavy volume was absent. Ideally, a breakout should involve a minimum 40% to 50% increase in volume vs. the 50-day average.All daily charts in Investors.com and MarketSmith show the 50-day average turnover as a red line drawn across the volume bars at the bottom of each chart.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, charts, buy points, proper sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:How Are The Top Growth Stocks Faring?

341,CL,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

346,CL,"Goldman Sachs thinks Brazil's in line for the throne. UBS analysts have their money (well, maybe not literally) on Germany. As the 2018 FIFA World Cup approaches on Thursday, 32 teams are vying to win it all in Russia. But on their jerseys, the competition is much less broad. Adidas (ADDYY) and Nike (NKE) are once again going head to head for brand dominance on the field.Adidas has a more official presence, being a World Cup sponsor and all, not to mention the provider of the match ball, the new ""Telstar 18.""And with 12 teams wearing its kits, the No. 2 global athletic brand is outfitting the most teams in the tournament, including Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Egypt, Sweden, Japan, host country Russia and defending title holder Germany.Domestically, soccer (aka football everywhere else) is a bit of a snoozer Stateside — the Americans were shut out of the World Cup. That means more muted interest this time around.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut as the world's favorite sport, it remains a driver of growth for Adidas. The Germany-based company said in early May that its running, football, training and Adidas Originals categories each grew by double digits, helping to drive an overall 11% revenue increase within its Adidas brand.Meanwhile, Nike has 10 teams on its World Cup roster: Brazil, England, France, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Croatia, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal and South Korea. CEO Mark Parker is ""excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup"" on its Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, he told analysts on the call in March.The tournament hasn't even begun yet, but it is not without controversy. Nike said last week that it would not provide cleats to Iran's national soccer team amid renewed U.S. sanctions against the country. Jersey-wise, the Iranian players will wear Adidas; the Three Stripes is not an official sponsor, but sold uniforms to the team at a steep discount, according to CNBC.A handful of smaller Adidas and Nike rivals (some much smaller) will also be on the pitch. Puma is outfitting Switzerland, Serbia, Senegal and Uruguay. Panama and Costa Rica are wearing New Balance. Peru and Tunisia's teams will take the field in Umbro and Uhlsport, respectively. Denmark's jerseys are made by Hummel, and Iceland's by Errea.Making a mark on the world stage doesn't come cheap, though the expenses are no doubt familiar and seemingly necessary for any athletic brand that wants to maintain its presence in the sport. Adidas plunks down a reported $70 million per World Cup for the honor of official sponsorship. Both major players are on a marketing tear, with Nike rousing the fans in Brazil and Adidas blasting out a star-studded commercial featuring soccer stars Lionel Messi, David Beckham and others.The ultimate question, of course, is to what extent their efforts will drive more sales of kits and footwear. Four years is a long time between events, and technology has changed the way people shop, even since 2014.""The speed of change with consumers has accelerated over the last four years,"" said Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser. It's not just about what the message is, he said, but how the message is delivered — and ultimately how that translates to the cash register.Bloomberg says both brands together sold nearly $5 billion in soccer gear in 2016. Adidas has lower expectations for this World Cup vs. the previous one.""There is no doubt that the Russian event or the World Cup in Russia does carry lower financial opportunities than the similar event four years ago in Brazil,"" said Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted on the company'st most recent earnings call. ""At the same time, we're looking forward to it, it's going to be a fantastic way of bringing our brand to life globally.""Still, he told Bloomberg that he expects Adidas shirt sales, which hit 8 million in 2014, to be even greater this time around.And analysts at HSBC expect the World Cup to be a positive for Nike, Adidas and Puma.""Even if soccer is not a dominant category for any, the upcoming World Cup in two months will likely provide a halo impact on the sector,"" said analyst Erwan Rambourg in an April note.Nike shares fell 0.4% on the stock market today.

355,CL,"The coalition of companies jockeying with Amazon.com (AMZN) for a lucrative Pentagon computing contract is far bigger than previously reported, signaling added heft behind efforts to keep the work from going exclusively to the world's largest cloud services provider.SAP America (SAP), General Dynamics' (GD) CSRA unit, Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among at least nine companies that have coordinated their opposition to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, according to emails obtained by Bloomberg News. The Amazon cloud services business leads the market and is widely perceived to be the front-runner.The most active members of the coalition trying to fend off an Amazon cloud win are Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and International Business Machines (IBM), according to two people familiar with the matter. Other companies involved include Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Bloomberg has reported.SAP and the others aren't considered top contenders for the contract. But the companies are banding together to fight the Pentagon's plans to award it to a single bidder. They're concerned it could disrupt their established business model for obtaining military contracts.The Pentagon announced a winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar cloud services contract in March.It has since paused the bidding process for the project. The reason is it would transition massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. The government has said it still plans to award the contract by September.Representatives for SAP, Red Hat, CSRA and VMware declined to comment.The interest is widespread among technology companies in pressing the Pentagon to change its procurement approach. For one, it indicates the importance of the lucrative contract. Providers are struggling to catch up to Amazon cloud. The same is true for firms that sell software and other technology to federal agencies.Companies have begun conversations about jointly bidding for the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, sources say.The Pentagon has tapped Dana Deasy to be its new chief information officer to oversee the contract. Members of the coalition welcome the move, sources say.""Dana Deasy is a highly professional, seasoned, transformational CIO who will lead the DoD's technology efforts with distinction,"" Oracle's Senior Vice President Ken Glueck said in a statement.Deasy's comments before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in May pleased the coalition, sources say. While he didn't address the JEDI contract specifically, he talked about the importance of using multiple cloud providers.Deasy previously worked as global chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at a time when the company made major investments to transition to a public cloud. He held similar positions at the North American unit of General Motors (GM), Tyco International and Siemens' (SIEGY) North American operation.""Under Deasy's leadership, the department will gradually consolidate its disparate networks, data centers and cloud efforts to manage them at the enterprise level,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement Monday.To advance their agenda, the tech allies have been strategizing by email and phone. They've courted trade and mainstream media and lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House, Bloomberg has reported.The competitive cloud coalition has notched some wins. The House committee in charge of federal spending approved a Defense Department funding bill this month. It would halt funding for the contract until the Pentagon submits a strategy to sustain competition and use multiple cloud-service providers.It is the third attempt by lawmakers to influence the process. The full House is scheduled to take up the spending measure this week.

356,CL,"Kraft Heinz  (KHC) reportedly is interested in buying Campbell Soup (CPB), which is mulling strategic options as packaged-food giants struggle. Rivals such as General Mills (GIS) also could want to take a bite of the soup and snack giant.Campbell Soup stock jumped 9.4% to close at 42.23, and Kraft Heinz stock edged up 0.2% to 63.32 in the stock market today. General Mills stock added 1.8%. All three packaged-food stocks are still trading near multiyear lows.A Kraft-Campbell deal could boost Warren Buffett's exposure to the ailing packaged-food industry. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is a major shareholder of Kraft Heinz, which believes the soup and snack maker will likely put itself up for sale soon, sources told the New York Post.Campbell Soup said in May it was reviewing all aspects of its strategic plans and expects to discuss the outcome in August. CEO Denise Morrison abruptly resigned last month as Campbell Soup cut earnings guidance. The company has not yet named a permanent replacement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSoup giant Campbell looked for growth with purchases such as Bolthouse Farm juices, Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies. But its $6.1 billion buyout of Snyder's-Lance came just as the packaged-food industry slumped.The company's bleak full-year forecast pummeled the stock in May, ultimately taking a toll on the reign of its seven-year chief executive.The B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.15% to undercut the May low of 188.62.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO), another consumer products giant in which Berkshire holds a notable stake, rose 0.8%.Kraft Heinz arose through a 2015 merger of food giants Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz.Buffett owned 500 million shares of Heinz before the merger, while his investment partner, 3G Capital, owned a similar stake in Heinz. Buffett now owns 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz, valued at $20.3 billion as of March.Initially, Kraft Heinz stock rallied as the new owners boosted profits despite flat-to-falling sales by cutting costs. But like a ketchup bottle running low, cost-squeezing efforts seem to have run their course. Meanwhile, traditional branded food companies are facing multiple headwinds. They're struggling to appeal to changing consumer tastes toward organic and natural foods. Meanwhile, grocery sellers are stepping up house brands, with more attractive packaging and quality. Food companies also have cut marketing spending to boost short-term profit, but at the risk of losing long-term brand exposure.Kraft Heinz may see a Campbell Soup deal as a way to wring out more costs. Kraft in 2017 made a bid for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (UN), which rebuffed the offer.Buffett reportedly remains optimistic about companies that sell consumer packaged goods. Both Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola are top-five stock holdings in his widely followed investment portfolio.

357,CL,"Comcast (CMCSA) launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) on Wednesday, offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company and at a 19% premium over Walt Disney's (DIS) offer.Comcast's takeover bid had been expected in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory late Tuesday that cleared its purchase of Time Warner (TWX). The nation's largest cable TV firm has been waiting for a ruling on the AT&T-Time Warner merger before announcing a formal bid for Fox.Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.Disney, however, in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Disney gained 1.9% to 106.30.While Wall Street fears a bidding war, one scenario is that the companies carve up Fox, with Comcast getting Sky as well as video streaming service Hulu and perhaps other assets.Disney's deal includes Fox's stake in U.K.-based Sky, a film studio, cable networks and other assets. It excludes the Fox Broadcasting Network. Disney already owns broadcaster ABC.One obstacle to a truce is the history between the companies. A much smaller Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004 but was rebuffed.Meanwhile, AT&T fell 6% to 32.22, despite its court victory. One analyst said AT&T's fall may be tied to arbitrage over the Time Warner transaction. MoffettNathanson also downgraded AT&T to sell.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry.Shares in CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and other media firms rose in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory.The landmark antitrust victory over the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media assets by telecoms or even internet companies, such as Amazon.com (AMZN).Viacom (VIA) gained 0.7% to 33.55 while CBS was up 3.6% to 54.27. Discovery rose 1.6% to 24.41. Lions Gate closed up 3% to 24.87 after jumping nearly 9% earlier.

Disney gained 1.9% to 106.30.While Wall Street fears a bidding war, one scenario is that the companies carve up Fox, with Comcast getting Sky as well as video streaming service Hulu and perhaps other assets.Disney's deal includes Fox's stake in U.K.-based Sky, a film studio, cable networks and other assets. It excludes the Fox Broadcasting Network. Disney already owns broadcaster ABC.One obstacle to a truce is the history between the companies. A much smaller Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004 but was rebuffed.Meanwhile, AT&T fell 6% to 32.22, despite its court victory. One analyst said AT&T's fall may be tied to arbitrage over the Time Warner transaction. MoffettNathanson also downgraded AT&T to sell.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry.Shares in CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and other media firms rose in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory.The landmark antitrust victory over the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media assets by telecoms or even internet companies, such as Amazon.com (AMZN).Viacom (VIA) gained 0.7% to 33.55 while CBS was up 3.6% to 54.27. Discovery rose 1.6% to 24.41. Lions Gate closed up 3% to 24.87 after jumping nearly 9% earlier.

366,CL,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the Dow Jones industrial average? It gauges the stock performance of 30 really big, household-name U.S. companies deemed to be representative of the U.S. economy.If you watch the news, perhaps you know that the Dow Jones industrial average, or the Dow, is a thing that rises, falls, swoons, surges, plunges, rallies or tanks. When it tanks, it's very bad and very important. It drives men in decorated sport coats, the vibe of which is somewhere between executive and airline captain, to bury their heads in their hands and leave paper all over the floor.You'd be forgiven for not knowing the finer points of what the Dow Jones industrial average actually is. The Dow Jones industrial average is an index that gauges the stock performance of 30 large, well-known companies. A stock index is a compilation of any number of stocks — with different prices, moving in different directions — represented by a single number.You already know many of the stocks that are part of the Dow. Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) are part of the Dow. General Electric (GE), the last original member, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on June 26, 2018.Created in 1896 to bring more transparency to the stock market, the Dow intends to offer a big-picture view of how the economic, business and political climate might affect big companies seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow is not a physical place, like a trading floor, where people go to buy or sell stocks. When you see pictures of traders pointing, yelling or despairing, they're probably on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.The ""Dow"" in ""Dow Jones"" is also completely different Dow from the Dow in the chemical giant DowDuPont. However, DowDuPont (DOW) is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.There are no explicit numerical requirements that companies must meet for their stocks to become part of the index. But there are broader, qualitative benchmarks for Dow companies, according to Jamie Farmer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.A company needs to have a strong reputation, have a history of weathering economic storms, and its shares need to be widely owned by investors, he said. Companies on the Dow also need to get a lot of their sales from the U.S. — at least a plurality, Farmer said. The companies also generally have to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.""Dow"" is for Charles Dow. ""Jones"" is for Edward Jones. The two were journalists who founded Dow Jones & Co. in 1882, along with another reporter, Charles Bergstresser. In 1889, they created the Wall Street Journal. On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones industrial average began measuring stocks — at first, only 12.""Its initial purpose was really just kind of an editorial function,"" Farmer said. ""They wanted a way to describe what was going on in the stock market on a daily basis.""That wasn't always easy in the U.S. stock market's early days.As Charles Geisst's book ""Wall Street: A History"" describes, prices for transactions on the New York Stock and Exchange Board, founded in 1817, weren't always public, let alone available to the area's newspapers.Regulations were also flimsy. Markets were easily manipulated. The 1800s were marked by cycles of wild speculation, panic and bank implosions that swallowed the economy — a process that played out multiple times over the century. Predatory tactics abounded.The daily publication of the Dow Jones industrial average numbers helped investors follow stock market movements more clearly, easing some investor fears, Geisst writes.And just what is the Dow Jones industrial average's justification for being ""industrial"" and an ""average""? That's a little more complicated.When the Dow Jones industrial average first launched, the 12 companies that it tracked were companies in the industrial sector: American Tobacco, Tennessee Coal & Iron, U.S. Leather, U.S. Rubber. General Electric was on there too, initially, before it was removed from the index and later restored in 1907, before ultimately getting removed again in 2018.Many of those companies were broken up, absorbed by others, or morphed into different businesses over time.In the beginning, the Dow was a pure ""average"" of the stocks in it. The prices of those 12 stocks were added up, divided by 12, and then you got the singular price for the whole thing.Today, that's not the case. The Dow uses a mechanism called a ""divisor"" to help calculate that singular, representative price of the index's stocks. The divisor is there to smooth out the bumps in price that come from things like stock splits or the addition or removal of stocks from the index. The Dow is also price weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have a bigger influence on the index than lower-priced ones.Over the decades, the Dow has become less ""industrial,"" per se, though it includes big names like GE, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). But the index has evolved to include large tech and financial-services players, which are more representative of the economy today.In the prior tweak, DowDuPont replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC); Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up; and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

Square, which tried to break out amid the selling Tuesday, moved back above the buy zone Wednesday, while Mastercard and Visa remain above entry points.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) tumbled between 4% and 6% Tuesday each as investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, pushing the rate on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.79%. The two-year yield skidded, but not as much, to 2.34%, squeezing the yield spread and banks' profitability on loans. (These Wall Street giants rose modestly Wednesday, with Treasury yields recouping some losses.)But financial stocks with less exposure to falling interest rates were relatively unscathed. Visa and Mastercard, for example, oversee vast payment networks but don't issue credit cards directly, unlike fellow Dow Jones components JPMorgan and American Express (AXP). That means they aren't exposed to lower rates or credit risk directly. Payments firms PayPal and Square also are largely insulated from interest rates, though Square does make some loans to small businesses.

381,CL,"Top-rated retailer Ross Stores (ROST) as well as IBD 50 names Twitter (TWTR), TAL Education (TAL) and Momo (MOMO), scored new highs Friday. The latter three are well-extended past proper buy points.But Ross Stores is still in buy range from its handle entry at 84.67. Ross flashed a sell signal from a prior 82.91 entry when it fell 7.8% below the buy point. A key IBD sell rule says to always cut losses at 7% or 8% from your purchase price. Sometimes, a loss can be cut sooner than that.Despite a strong move for the stock in the past 10 years, Ross's latest breakout is still early stage, because the stock reset its base count when it made a big consolidation last year. The low undercut the low of the prior base, shaking enough sellers out to reset the base count. The breakout on Nov. 17 was first stage.Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) also made the new highs list. The stock looks poised for its third straight gain Friday. It cleared a 105.14 buy point Wednesday in higher volume. It's still within the 5% buy zone, although the market faces some risk.As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed five distribution days each. Meaningful losses for the major stock indexes in higher volume are a sign of institutional selling. The number of distribution days should always be monitored closely when the market is in a confirmed uptrend — like now.The financial sector also delivered some new highs. Small-cap Cadence Bancorp (CADE) popped above a 30.60 buy point Friday. It's plenty liquid with an average daily volume of more than 1 million shares.

393,CL,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

400,CL,"Through May 31, the S&P 500 was up 1.3% year to date. Not a savory number for index investors. The Nasdaq composite rose 7.8%. And the IBD 50 gained 5.1%.While the list of premier growth companies has outperformed the large-cap benchmark by nearly fourfold, have some of the individual names done even better? You bet.Use the IBD 50 as a timesaving screen for picking great stocks at the right time. You know that making the IBD 50 means a company has top-notch fundamentals and wonderful relative strength. But the IBD 50 remains a watch list, not a buy list.What does this mean? Let the chart analysis at the bottom of every mini chart in IBD Weekly be your compass. If a stock is breaking out and in the permissible buy range, the analysis will say so. If not, then stay alert for follow-on buy points.Such additional entry points may include first and second rebounds off the 10-week moving average. Or a stock may thrust out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.Let's consider Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), SVB Financial (SIVB), Trade Desk (TTD) and TAL Education (TAL). All five made the IBD 50 during the week of Feb. 26. February was a pivotal month in 2018 so far; the S&P 500 suffered its first 10%-plus correction since February of 2016. Yet these five companies flexed strength.They also help teach stock traders the importance of being nimble.Viper Energy finished the week ended Feb. 23 with a tiny gain, up 0.3%. That trailed a 0.5% rebound by the S&P 500. Then the U.S. oil and gas play fell for three weeks in a row.On the surface that sounds bad, right?Well, not necessarily. This is where careful analysis of Viper's weekly chart comes into play. While the stock did fall three weeks in a row, it limited the overall decline to 3.2% — skimpy and stingy losses.Check out the week ended March 16. Viper bounded off its lows of the week and cut the loss to just 0.4%. It was a tight weekly close. Tight weekly closes within a base matter. Viper had a lot of them. Treat them as a subtle clue that institutional investors are not that willing to dump shares.The Midland, Texas-based firm uncoiled out of its base with a breakout past 26.29 on April 5. Volume wasn't hissing quietly; 1.3 million shares exchanged hands, 219% above the 50-day average. Big price move, big volume on the breakout? Good results usually follow.Viper is now trading near 32, up 22% past the proper entry.Intuitive Surgical, noted as a ""stock of the day"" in IBD's social media coverage, hit a new high of 452 on Jan. 25, then began falling a few days before the major indexes did. Shares basically floated within a relatively tight trading range of 400 to 450.But on April 18, the stock's character changed. After reporting strong Q1 results (earnings up 43%, revenue up 25%, the biggest top-line jump in more than four years), Intuitive jammed out of an 11-week base. Both 452.10 and 445.20 are valid entry points.The robotic surgery systems pioneer has not gained a lot since then. But at 459, the medical stock leader has stretched its advance from an early breakout at 242.49 in February 2017 to 89%.SVB Financial, TAL and Trade Desk have also cleared new bases in recent weeks and are spanking the S&P 500 with year-to-date returns of 33%, 43% and 87%.You can trade the IBD 50 efficiently with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) by Innovator Capital.

Yet, the stock's long-term story remains intact.

405,CL,"U.S. stock indexes were mixed near midday Wednesday, but the charts show the market's sideways action is still the rule. Meanwhile, upscale plays Ralph Lauren (RL) and Tiffany (TIF) broke out.Ever since the major indexes retook their 50-day lines, the stock market has been moving essentially sideways in a narrow trading range. Bulls and bears alike would like to see that pattern broken, though they have different preferences on the desired direction.The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. The small cap S&P 600 was up 0.1%.Volume rose on the NYSE but was down on the Nasdaq, compared with the same time Tuesday.The market has had trouble identifying leadership recently. Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — are mirroring the market's uncertainty.For instance, Apple gained as much as 16% since late April but has shifted sideways since. The sideways action isn't necessarily bad. Apple has a shot at forming a bullish, three-weeks-tight pattern.But like the market itself, Apple's price action has been mostly sloppy since late January. The recent tight action could be a good sign.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, upscale retail and apparel showed the morning's best gains.Upscale home furnishings provider RH (RH) climbed 4% in soft volume. Fellow luxury play Williams-Sonoma (WSM) surged 3% in strong volume.In the apparel space, upscale Ralph Lauren gapped up 14% in huge volume. Ralph Lauren topped the Street's consensus estimate on earnings and revenue. The midcap company unexpectedly reported an improvement in margins. Ralph Lauren sold more items full price.Meanwhile, high-end jewelry chain Tiffany gapped up 17% after releasing quarterly results that beat views on the top and bottom lines.The strength in upscale-oriented stocks would be a good thing, if it were to continue. Consumers favor upscale products when they are feeling confident about the economy.Meanwhile, the banks got some good news late Tuesday but couldn't do much with it. The House approved changes to the Dodd-Frank law that should help banks, particularly the smaller banks. But most bank groups were down Wednesday, apparently having already priced in the news.Additional changes in banking deregulation and capital formation will be considered in the Senate. Given that the details and outcome aren't yet clear, bank stocks could get additional favorable news.Also, interest rates could improve net interest margins and earnings for banks. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) grew earnings 7% and 11% in 2016-17. Analysts expect that to leap 33% this year. Recent earnings revision have been upward.Wednesday morning, JPMorgan fell 1.5% as it tested support at its 50-day line.The flash Purchasing Managers Index rolled in at 55.7% for May, above the highest estimate in the range.New home sales for April came in lower than expected.

X As you try to find the best stocks to buy and watch, be sure to pay attention to relative price strength.This unique rating identifies technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks compares to the rest of the market.

Also understand that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. While sales growth fell last quarter from 403% to 253%, EPS grew 400%, up from 0% in the previous report.

421,CL,"Contrarian investing is sometimes advantageous. The IBD-style investor, though, isn't contrarian in all situations, just those that coincide with the odds.For example, IBD's 20% to 25% profit-taking rule often will put the investor in the contrarian camp.When a stock breaks out and advances 20% to 25%, many shareholders will get excited. In most cases, they should be thinking about taking profits, not marrying the stock.Here are five stocks that hit new highs Friday and have reached the profit-taking zone.Real estate manager Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL) is about 25% above its 570.09 entry.

422,CL,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all started last week higher but closed the week modestly lower. This sideways stock market action offered a chance for many leading stocks to work on handles in their consolidations. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) finished handles last week, offering new buy points. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Alibaba (BABA) finished handles on Monday.All five stocks rallied at least 1% on Monday, with Twitter attempting a breakout. The stocks were mixed Tuesday morning.Handles offer a last shakeout of weak holders. When a stock clears a proper handle in strong volume, it's evidence that the stock is ready to advance.Proper handles involve at least five days of moderate declines, though some develop over several weeks. You want to see a gradual drift, ideally in light trade. Heavy trade would imply selling from big institutions. The midpoint of the handle should be above the midpoint of the base. If a handle forms in the lower half of a pattern, there may still be selling pressure as old investors seek to exit with a profit or minimal losses.While handles are most closely associated with cup bases, they also form on double-bottom patterns. Twitter and Akamai stocks are cup-with-handle bases, while the Facebook stock handle is on a double bottom. Alphabet and Alibaba stocks are trying to finish handles in double bottoms.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook stock formed an oddly shaped, double-bottom base, with the second leg of the W falling sharply lower amid the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. The stock cleared a 186.20 buy point on May 11, but volume was well below average. Indeed, shares had been rallying for a few weeks on weak trade.But after that tepid breakout, Facebook stock has pulled back modestly in even-lighter volume. As of Friday's close, Facebook stock has a handle with a new 188.42 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 182.68, then rose 1% to 184.49 on Monday.Facebook fell 0.4% to 183.80 in stock market trading today.Keep in mind that the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the start of November and hasn't made headway for the past 10 months.Twitter has formed a cup-with-handle base with a 33.88 entry. Much of the base formed below its 50-day moving average, though the handle is moderately above that level. Twitter stock price ended Friday at 32.63.Twitter climbed 3.1% to 33.63 Monday after rising as high as 34.03. The breakout attempt came on below average. Twitter fell 2.3% to 32.86 on Tuesday.Akamai Technologies formed a cup base since March 9, forging a handle last week. That gives the stock a 77.69 buy point. The stock climbed 1.5% to 76.46 Monday. Shares popped to 78.25 intraday Tuesday, briefly clearing the entry point, but reversed to close off 0.1% to 76.39.The Google parent rose 1.3% to 1,084.01 on Monday. As of Monday's close, Alphabet stock has a proper handle with a 1,118.25 entry point.However, the midpoint of the handle is just above the midpoint of the base. While that's proper, it also means a fair amount of overhead resistance could remain.Also, the stock's RS line has gone sideways for year, as Alphabet has moved in line with the S&P 500 index.Alphabet fell 0.8% to 1,075.31 on Tuesday.Alibaba has formed a shallow double-bottom base. On Monday, shares rose 1.35% to 197.64. The stock now has handle on a daily chart, creating a 200.10 entry.  Alibaba lost 0.9% to 195.87.But on a weekly chart, this potential handle isn't visible, because Alibaba rose fractionally last week and is up slightly so far this week. The handle buy point also isn't much lower than the 201.60 entry from just above the middle of the double-bottom's ""W.""At minimum, Alibaba's stock appears to be facing resistance at 200. The stock hasn't been above 200 since the mid-March peak of the middle part of the W.

426,CL,"Don't feel bad if you've never heard of Baozun (BZUN). The China-based stock stands poised 8% below a proper buy point ahead of its earnings report due Thursday.When it comes to China internet stocks trading in the U.S., Baozun doesn't have anywhere near the name recognition of a Baidu (BIDU) or an Alibaba (BABA).But it does qualify as an IBD Sector Leader. And among non-China-based companies doing business over China's internet, Baozun is a leading brand. The company's website cites data from iResearch saying Baozun holds 22% of China's e-commerce solutions market.That is a big piece of business. China's online population rose by 40.7 million connected users in 2017 to 772 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. The number is well over double the entire population of the U.S.Baozun provides e-commerce systems to homegrown Chinese companies, as well as to non-China-based companies aiming to connect with China's avid internet shoppers. It assists client/partners including Nike (NKE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Dutch consumer electronics and industrial products titan Philips (PHG). It helps market and deliver products via Chinese retail venues such as Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com (JD).In addition, it helps spin products and promotions across social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo (WB).Baozun's enterprise product suite covers essentially the entire e-commerce arc. From IT solutions and store operations, to digital marketing, customer services, warehousing and fulfillment. Markets range from apparel, electronics, insurance, automobiles, food and health products, and home furnishings.The stock, which is listed on the Nasdaq, began trading on the U.S. market three years ago. It spent its first 15 months consolidating below its IPO price. It staged its first official breakout in May 2017. On Monday, the stock traded up 158% from that initial breakout. It was 339% above its IPO price.For the first quarter, analyst consensus projects a 14% EPS gain to a modest 8 cents. The company has either met or beat analysts' targets in the past four quarters. In the December quarter, Baozun topped earnings expectations by about 35%.It also has grown earnings by triple digits in six of the past nine quarters. Consensus estimates point to a 10% rise in revenue. That would be down sharply from Baozun's 25% average revenue gain over the past three quarters.Shares on Monday were about 8% below a 52.43 buy point in an eight-week base. The base is a third-stage pattern. Baozun plans to report early Thursday.Among the other China-based names set to report results this week: Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) and China Lodging (HTHT) report after Monday's close.

427,CL,"To make money in the stock market, you have to start with big money, right?Well, no. Contrary to conventional wisdom, you don't need to have a hefty trust fund or ultradeep pockets like mutual funds and other institutional players to start investing.""If you're a typical working person or a beginning investor, you should know that it doesn't take a lot of money to start,"" IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""You can begin with as little as $500 to $1,000 and add to it as you earn and save more money.""In fact, O'Neil started his investing career at the ripe old age of 21 years with just a five-share purchase of Procter & Gamble (PG).What's more important than how much money you have to invest is learning how to pick the best stocks. Stocks have the potential for big gains if you know which ones to pick at the right time. There are two components to the right time: the stock itself and the overall market.A stock could sport top-notch fundamentals, such as high Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength ratings. Use Stock Checkup as a guide. The company may clearly be a leader in its field, but it's prudent to wait until the stock is breaking out from a sound base in rising volume. Doing so boosts your chances of snaring a profit.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo further raise the odds of a big run-up after a breakout, it's best to buy when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Three of four stocks will eventually follow the market's direction, so it doesn't make sense to buy during a correction or when the market is under pressure.Let's say you have $500 or $1,000 to invest. Don't try to reduce risk by buying 10 stocks. Concentrate instead on one or two potential winners. With $10,000, stick with three or four good stocks instead of a basket of names.Suppose you have $10,000 and invested $5,000 of it in Facebook (FB) at its July 2013 breakout from a first-stage base. If you had bought shares near the correct buy point at 32.61 and held the position through mid-April in 2016, you would have gained 240%, or $12,000. Not a bad gain.How about putting another $2,500 to work in Reynolds American as it cleared a base — a saucer base with a 52.67 buy point — in March 2014? With an 85% profit (excluding dividends), that wad grew to $4,625 just a little more than two years later.If the remaining $2,500 went to the airline operator Hawaiian Holdings (HA) at its Oct. 22, 2014, breakout past a 16.18 buy point in a superb double bottom base, shares would have soared 210% to $7,750 less than two years later.That initial $10,000 would now be worth $29,375.

428,CL,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales.

JPMorgan's 2.1% annualized dividend yield exceeds the 1.82% yield for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up to 2.96%, rising for the third time in four sessions and up from 2.41% on Jan. 1.Apple continues to act well ever since it broke out of a bottoming base, a first-stage cup with handle and a 118.12 buy point, on Jan. 6, 2017.

The positive price-and-volume action points to institutional accumulation, a critical element of all confirmed uptrends.The solid earnings outlook, huge corporate buyback plan, and Apple's success in becoming a giant in digital services revenue (think its music service and Apple Pay) appear to stand as positive factors for further upside.The Street has trimmed its profit estimates recently, but still sees the bottom line growing 25% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.49 a share and up 15% to $13.25 in FY 2019.Grubhub, the leading company in the fast-growing market of online and mobile food ordering, fell more than 1% but is still acting fine.

439,CL,"In just four months, Amazon (AMZN) has gone from being the biggest threat to health care industry profits to an underdog.XBack in January, when Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) unveiled their new partnership to tame medical costs, the news bulldozed health care stocks.Barely four months later, the trio of companies have found a CEO to lead their venture and plan an announcement within weeks, Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Thursday.Yet the emerging reality looks a lot less scary than the original idea to health care investors, if Thursday's market action is any indication.For example, UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer slid more than 4% on that original Jan. 30 announcement, while Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled about 5%.But both stocks were higher on Thursday, with Walgreens gaining 0.7% and UnitedHealth edging up 0.1%, close to its all-time high hit the day before the big Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEven though Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Buffet and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted at the time, ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" and said they were in their early planning stages, investors panicked.The only plausible explanation for such an overreaction was that Amazon had reportedly been gearing up for months to take on the retail drug industry, while challenging drug distributors and kicking the middleman — pharmacy benefit managers — to the curb.Yet four months later, Amazon's health care ambitions look a whole lot less earth-shattering and unlikely to diminish health care industry profitability for years to come.In April, CNBC reported that Amazon had dropped plans to become a wholesale distributor of prescription drugs due to the cost and complexity. Investors seemed to interpret that retreat as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business.Bezos is clearly comfortable in the underdog role and can't be counted out.

447,CL,"Have you noticed how some top growth stocks seem to make the IBD 50 week in, week out? Or, after taking a brief vacation outside the list, some of these market leaders knock on the IBD 50's door, saying ""I'm home""?One reason for that: high-quality growth in quarterly sales and earnings. Consider Adobe Systems (ADBE). What is high quality? How about the digital imaging and marketing company growing earnings per share 48%, 39%, 45%, 42%, 44%, 47%, 40% and 65% in the past eight quarters?A second reason: strong price-and-volume action. Adobe's relative strength line, a gauge of performance vs. the S&P 500, climbs higher over the long term. That RS line doesn't show a big break in its upward trend, especially on a weekly chart.Want a third reason? High relative industry group strength. Adobe helps fulfill the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The ""L"" stands for leader, not laggard.Stocks showing excellence across the broad industry sector or specific industry group tend to do much better than stocks that belong to an industry group that's merely bumbling along. No wonder, then, that the IBD 50 tends to have a tilt toward the strongest sectors over the past three to 12 months.So an experienced stock picker will not be surprised to find that the computer, finance, medical and consumer-oriented sectors occupy the biggest tracts of real estate within the IBD 50.As of Thursday, the computer and finance sectors held the highest number of slots in the IBD 50, with nine stocks each. The related bank sector had one member, SVB Financial (SIVB). Medical was third with seven.Grubhub (GRUB) shows how some special stocks in the current market uptrend seem to straddle two or more sectors at the same time.You don't call Chicago-based Grubhub on the phone and ask them to order pizza or sushi on your behalf. Grubhub is an internet and mobile-based platform. It brings restaurants ever closer to customers. This business model is not exactly new, but the managers are executing growth with the precision of an all-star slugger.Trade Desk (TTD) hails from the business services sector. As of Thursday, it ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The sector has advanced 11% since Jan. 1. Trade Desk is up 82% year to date. Why? Here again, fundamentals matter.The Ventura, Calif.-based company has created a self-service platform in which ad buyers and agencies can efficiently select when and where to place their ads. The goal: maximize return on investment. Judging by Trade Desk's sales, its ""omnichannel"" and ""programmatic"" features are attracting more advertising dollars and bigger corporate customers.Trade Desk's sales grew 61% in the first quarter to $85.7 million. In Q4 last year, the top line bulged 42% and hit the $100 million mark for the first time. Sales rose on average 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.That kind of sales growth tends to lead to fantastic bottom-line growth. Trade Desk, which in some respects can be seen as an internet sector play, is no exception. Earnings have soared 22%, 100%, 148%, 46%, 64% and 89%.Now there's a super-easy way to find out which stocks have newly entered the IBD 50.

448,CL,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales. You get the picture.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

449,CL,"It's not hard to find top growth stocks in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. ZTO Express (ZTO), one of many top growth stocks based in China, debuted in Monday's screen. The screen also includes China names Baozun (BZUN) and Alibaba (BABA).ZTO Express is an express delivery firm with a market capitalization of around $12.8 billion. It's very liquid with an average daily volume of 2.7 million shares.It was an inauspicious debut for ZTO Express when it went public in October 2016 at 19.50 a share. The good news at the time was that it priced above the proposed range of 16.50 to 18.50 a share. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the underwriters. The bad news is that the stock headed lower after its first week of trading. Shares fell about 35% over the next four months.Fast forward to today, however, and a booming e-commerce market in China is fueling growth at ZTO Express. Just like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) deliver packages for Amazon.com (AMZN), ZTO Express does the same for Alibaba.Earlier this month, the company reported adjusted profit of 17 cents a share, up 70% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales growth, meanwhile, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, rising 48% to $563.4 million.Parcel volume in the fourth quarter totaled 2.015 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago period. Full-year parcel volume in 2017 increased 38.3% from 2016. Parcel volume market share increased 15.5% in 2017 from 14.4% in 2016.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn the Q4 press release, CEO Meisong Lai commented: ""We are optimistic about the growth prospects of the express delivery industry in China. As China enters the new retail era with e-commerce continuing to grow, industrywide parcel volume is estimated to increase from 40.1 billion parcels in 2017 to approximately 70 billion in 2020, according to the State Post Bureau.""ZTO Express is near the top of a long consolidation that started in November. The conventional entry is 18.18, 10 cents above the Nov. 10 intraday high of 18.08.Since ZTO Express is relatively new as a publicly traded company, fund sponsorship is on the light side.At the end of Q4, 155 funds owned shares.

451,CL,"Don't feel bad if you've never heard of Baozun (BZUN). The China-based stock stands poised 8% below a proper buy point ahead of its earnings report due Thursday.When it comes to China internet stocks trading in the U.S., Baozun doesn't have anywhere near the name recognition of a Baidu (BIDU) or an Alibaba (BABA).But it does qualify as an IBD Sector Leader. And among non-China-based companies doing business over China's internet, Baozun is a leading brand. The company's website cites data from iResearch saying Baozun holds 22% of China's e-commerce solutions market.That is a big piece of business. China's online population rose by 40.7 million connected users in 2017 to 772 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. The number is well over double the entire population of the U.S.Baozun provides e-commerce systems to homegrown Chinese companies, as well as to non-China-based companies aiming to connect with China's avid internet shoppers. It assists client/partners including Nike (NKE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Dutch consumer electronics and industrial products titan Philips (PHG). It helps market and deliver products via Chinese retail venues such as Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com (JD).In addition, it helps spin products and promotions across social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo (WB).Baozun's enterprise product suite covers essentially the entire e-commerce arc. From IT solutions and store operations, to digital marketing, customer services, warehousing and fulfillment. Markets range from apparel, electronics, insurance, automobiles, food and health products, and home furnishings.The stock, which is listed on the Nasdaq, began trading on the U.S. market three years ago. It spent its first 15 months consolidating below its IPO price. It staged its first official breakout in May 2017. On Monday, the stock traded up 158% from that initial breakout. It was 339% above its IPO price.For the first quarter, analyst consensus projects a 14% EPS gain to a modest 8 cents. The company has either met or beat analysts' targets in the past four quarters. In the December quarter, Baozun topped earnings expectations by about 35%.It also has grown earnings by triple digits in six of the past nine quarters. Consensus estimates point to a 10% rise in revenue. That would be down sharply from Baozun's 25% average revenue gain over the past three quarters.Shares on Monday were about 8% below a 52.43 buy point in an eight-week base. The base is a third-stage pattern. Baozun plans to report early Thursday.Among the other China-based names set to report results this week: Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) and China Lodging (HTHT) report after Monday's close.

453,CL,"Seven of IBD's current 10-stock list of Global Leaders are companies based in China. Three of those seven are still in bases or buy ranges.The three are Daqo New Energy (DQ), Alibaba Group (BABA) and ZTO Express (ZTO). Overall, the bases are messy. But all three are IBD 50 names. In addition, Alibaba is on IBD's Sector Leaders screen. So all three stocks are worthy of a closer look.The choppiness in the bases has less to do with the stocks themselves and owes more to the back-and-forth uncertainties as the U.S. and China wrestle to restructure their trade relationship. The tumult is affecting nearly all China stocks.Still, Daqo's base is sloppy because of the way the stock has spiked and tumbled during its consolidation. Still, it managed to build a valid double bottom with a 65.10 buy point. The base is also odd because the stock seemed to form a five-week handle beginning April 10.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the would-be handle is too low, with its midpoint below the midpoint in the overall pattern. What's more, the handle is 19% deep — beyond the 12% maximum for normal handles. (The 19% depth also squelches the interpretation that the five-week handle is a flat base.)Daqo broke out in a big 14% spike on May 16. On May 8, the producer of polysilicon used in photovoltaic cells had reported a solid first-quarter beat. After the breakout, shares rose almost 10% above the buy point. The stock is still near the entry.Investors are likely to be wary of Daqo's earnings outlook.

454,CL,"The candy and snack food industries are doing well right now, based on statistics released Tuesday at the Sweets and Snacks Expo. But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack. It's a much more crowded marketplace.""RELATED:Amazon Widens Its Influence Even More And Takes A Bite Out Of SnacksCampbell, Hershey, Humana Lead Frenzy Of Year-End M&A Activity

455,CL,"Have you noticed how some top growth stocks seem to make the IBD 50 week in, week out? Or, after taking a brief vacation outside the list, some of these market leaders knock on the IBD 50's door, saying ""I'm home""?One reason for that: high-quality growth in quarterly sales and earnings. Consider Adobe Systems (ADBE). What is high quality? How about the digital imaging and marketing company growing earnings per share 48%, 39%, 45%, 42%, 44%, 47%, 40% and 65% in the past eight quarters?A second reason: strong price-and-volume action. Adobe's relative strength line, a gauge of performance vs. the S&P 500, climbs higher over the long term. That RS line doesn't show a big break in its upward trend, especially on a weekly chart.Want a third reason? High relative industry group strength. Adobe helps fulfill the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The ""L"" stands for leader, not laggard.Stocks showing excellence across the broad industry sector or specific industry group tend to do much better than stocks that belong to an industry group that's merely bumbling along. No wonder, then, that the IBD 50 tends to have a tilt toward the strongest sectors over the past three to 12 months.So an experienced stock picker will not be surprised to find that the computer, finance, medical and consumer-oriented sectors occupy the biggest tracts of real estate within the IBD 50.As of Thursday, the computer and finance sectors held the highest number of slots in the IBD 50, with nine stocks each. The related bank sector had one member, SVB Financial (SIVB). Medical was third with seven.Grubhub (GRUB) shows how some special stocks in the current market uptrend seem to straddle two or more sectors at the same time.You don't call Chicago-based Grubhub on the phone and ask them to order pizza or sushi on your behalf. Grubhub is an internet and mobile-based platform. It brings restaurants ever closer to customers. This business model is not exactly new, but the managers are executing growth with the precision of an all-star slugger.Trade Desk (TTD) hails from the business services sector. As of Thursday, it ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The sector has advanced 11% since Jan. 1. Trade Desk is up 82% year to date. Why? Here again, fundamentals matter.The Ventura, Calif.-based company has created a self-service platform in which ad buyers and agencies can efficiently select when and where to place their ads. The goal: maximize return on investment. Judging by Trade Desk's sales, its ""omnichannel"" and ""programmatic"" features are attracting more advertising dollars and bigger corporate customers.Trade Desk's sales grew 61% in the first quarter to $85.7 million. In Q4 last year, the top line bulged 42% and hit the $100 million mark for the first time. Sales rose on average 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.That kind of sales growth tends to lead to fantastic bottom-line growth. Trade Desk, which in some respects can be seen as an internet sector play, is no exception. Earnings have soared 22%, 100%, 148%, 46%, 64% and 89%.Now there's a super-easy way to find out which stocks have newly entered the IBD 50.

463,CL,"Seven of IBD's current 10-stock list of Global Leaders are companies based in China. Three of those seven are still in bases or buy ranges.The three are Daqo New Energy (DQ), Alibaba Group (BABA) and ZTO Express (ZTO). Overall, the bases are messy. But all three are IBD 50 names. In addition, Alibaba is on IBD's Sector Leaders screen. So all three stocks are worthy of a closer look.The choppiness in the bases has less to do with the stocks themselves and owes more to the back-and-forth uncertainties as the U.S. and China wrestle to restructure their trade relationship. The tumult is affecting nearly all China stocks.Still, Daqo's base is sloppy because of the way the stock has spiked and tumbled during its consolidation. Still, it managed to build a valid double bottom with a 65.10 buy point. The base is also odd because the stock seemed to form a five-week handle beginning April 10.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the would-be handle is too low, with its midpoint below the midpoint in the overall pattern. What's more, the handle is 19% deep — beyond the 12% maximum for normal handles. (The 19% depth also squelches the interpretation that the five-week handle is a flat base.)Daqo broke out in a big 14% spike on May 16. On May 8, the producer of polysilicon used in photovoltaic cells had reported a solid first-quarter beat. After the breakout, shares rose almost 10% above the buy point. The stock is still near the entry.Investors are likely to be wary of Daqo's earnings outlook.

That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack.

469,CL,"If you like energy stocks, perhaps you've been licking your chops lately.After crude oil peaked in the summer of 2014, oil stocks fell furiously. IBD's integrated oil & gas industry group fell 51% to multi-year lows in January 2016, even as the S&P 500 marked new highs. Continental Resources (CLR), part of IBD's U.S. oil exploration group, slid from a 2014 high of 80.91 to a January 2016 low of 13.94, down 83%.The market is changing, though.For a long time, Energy ranked dead last among the 33 sectors featured in IBD's Smart Tables for NYSE and Nasdaq-listed companies. No longer.As seen in the latest stock tables, viewable online in the Data Tables section of Stock Lists at Investors.com, the Energy sector is now ranked No. 2. With WTI (West Texas intermediate) near-term futures holding firmly above the $70 level, the gigantic energy sector is showing signs of life again.Marathon Oil (MRO), one of two energy plays in IBD Leaderboard, has excelled since it jumped out of a nifty cup with handle at 18.76 on May 3 this year. That 13-week base is part of a bigger, longer cup-type pattern. So, you can interpret Marathon's action since December 2016 as a base-on-base pattern.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGo to a weekly chart and you'll see the integrated oil firm went through an Odyssey-like venture to multiyear lows, going from a 2014 high of 41.74 to a low of 6.52 in 2016. Serious destruction. But Marathon has recovered. The company has recently scored two solid quarters of profits and serious revenue growth (up 23% in Q4 2017, up 62% in Q1 2018).Shake Shack (SHAK), seller of one of the most popular burgers in the country, is forming a bottoming base. And Apple (AAPL) has thrived since it broke out of its own bottoming base, an 11-week cup with handle that completed at the end of 2016.Apple broke out of that perfect base on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12. Today, shares are hovering near 172, up more than 45%. Not bad for the largest company in the U.S. equities markets in terms of market value.In many cases such stocks won't become CAN SLIM-quality leaders for years. Yet eventually any sector in the stock market that is bludgeoned this badly will come back. But what should the disciplined investor look for in terms of these stocks' chart action?After the bear market of 2008-09 ended, sending the entire market to its knees, some growth stocks stopped kneeling. After the S&P 500's March 12, 2009, follow-through bottoming signal took hold, companies with excellent products, top-drawer management and industry-leading margins came back. They formed what IBD Chairman William O'Neil likes to call bottoming bases.What are the characteristics of a bottoming base?First, they form when the market has undergone a cataclysmic bear market. When the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq composite drops 40% to 50% from its highs, expect former growth stock leaders to drop 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times that amount. That's why you'll see some former market darlings fall 60% to 75% from their peaks, even more.The stock needs ample time to form the right side of a bottoming base. Think months, even years. Why so long? You want confirmation that institutional investors accumulate shares in a big way and eventually tip the scale from one of excess supply (funds are extra-willing to sell their shares) to excess demand (extra-willing to buy at any price).The traits of good bases all apply. Look for big up weeks in price in heavy or rising weekly volume. Seek symmetry within the base. If a handle forms, it should slant downward along the handle's price lows and volume should dry up. The base should show tight trading.Finally, keep an eagle eye out for a strong breakout to a 52-week high in heavy trade to trigger a buy point. Remember, for a bottoming base to complete, a stock doesn't have to necessarily trade at or near an all-time high.

Your stocks to watch this week are five payment-related names that might be worth putting into your portfolio, in addition to your wallet: Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Green Dot (GDOT), American Express (AXP) and Square (SQ).Mastercard leads payment stocks with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, while Visa's stock earns a 97 and Green Dot has a 96. Square follows with a 91 and American Express with an 88. Top stocks typically have high Composite Ratings as they launch big runs.These five stocks are among the leaders in the broader finance sector, with the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group ranking No. 50 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Mastercard is showing strength after breaking out past a 183.83 flat-base buy point on earnings. Since chasing a stock isn't ideal, it's best to make buys when shares are no more than 5% above a buy point.

The stock has made quite a comeback in recent years, and only surpassed its all-time high, set in 2011, just a few months ago.American Express is vying for a breakout of its own, with shares coming close to a 103.06 handle entry intraday Friday. AmEx backed away from that level, closing at 101.42. Shares dipped 0.1% on Monday. But the stock has had upward momentum since a recent rebound off the 50-day line. AmEx, like Visa, is a Dow Jones component.Square, one of the big winners from 2017, fell 0.8% Monday to 54.28, still in range from a 52.60 buy point from a double-bottom base. Shares are now 7% below their all-time high of 58.46 on March 21.Meanwhile, PayPal (PYPL) is consolidating since hitting an all-time high in late January.

472,CL,"Verizon Communications (VZ) stock climbed Tuesday as analysts pondered whether Amazon.com (AMZN) or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google loom as a more likely internet video partner when the telecom launches 5G residential broadband services in late 2018.Verizon hosted an analysts meeting late Monday where it touted its next-generation, 5G wireless strategy. Verizon told analysts that it will announce an OTT (over-the-top) partner in the fall when it expands 5G services to more markets. OTT is industry jargon for live TV or on-demand video delivered via broadband connections to homes.Verizon, which acquired AOL's and Yahoo's internet businesses, also updated analysts on the digital advertising platform being developed by its Oath-branded subsidiary.Oath's digital-ad products compete with Google and Facebook (FB).

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseColby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst, says Verizon could be leaning toward Amazon or Google. Amazon sells on-demand video similar to Netflix (NFLX). Amazon sells subscriptions to other video services, such as HBO, Showtime and Starz.Amazon, though, does not sell live TV content, unlike Google's YouTube or Hulu.""Amazon could make sense as an ideal way to leverage massive subscriber scale,"" Synesael said in a note to clients Tuesday. ""If Verizon goes the (virtual) MVPD route, YouTube TV could make sense.""Virtual MVPD, or multichannel video programming distributor, is industry lingo for selling services similar to that of a cable TV operator.AT&T (T) offers its own internet video services, while Hulu has partnered with Sprint (S). Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner (TWX). AT&T could become a part owner in Hulu if its acquisition of Time Warner is approved.T-Mobile US (TMUS), meanwhile, offers Netflix to its wireless subscribers. Analysts say it's doubtful that Verizon would team with Dish Network (DISH), a satellite TV broadcaster that has an internet video service.Analysts say Verizon stated at Monday's meeting that it has no plans to acquire a media company.""CEO Lowell McAdam firmly reiterated that Verizon sees no reason to jump into a 5G world and get into the linear content game,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, in a report.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe average Netflix user is watching the streaming service for more than 10 hours a week, which is nearly double its nearest competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu, which are closer to 5 hours a week, Ives said. That's ""an eye-popping disparity,"" he said.The company's investment in original content, with shows like ""Lost in Space"" and ""Stranger Things,"" will help it attract and retain subscribers in the U.S. and worldwide, Ives said.""Our bullish thesis on Netflix is based on our belief that the company's competitive moat, franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and original content buildout will translate into robust profitability and growth as the next phase of this story plays out over the coming year with $10 of earnings power by 2022,"" he said.The looming fight between Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) over 21st Century Fox (FOXA) shows how valuable entertainment assets are today, Ives said. Netflix to date has mostly built its content library organically.The transition to 4K ultra-high-definition television also could be a business driver for Netflix, Ives said.

481,CL,"A China-based new issue snapped free of its IPO base Tuesday and Wednesday, and Boise, Idaho's largest building products manufacturer remained in a buy range after a Friday breakout.But bank stocks Wednesday occupied nearly half of an Investor's Business Daily screen showing 32 stocks hitting new highs during the session, according to preliminary calculations. All of those were regional banks, most responding to banking reform legislation passed Tuesday and awaiting only a signature from President Trump in order to become law.The bill, among many other things, rolls back compliance oversight on banks managing between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets. All of the banks in that range which were hashing out new highs Wednesday traded well below the 400,000 share-per-day minimum required for CAN SLIM-grade stocks.Another new high went briefly to Urban Outfitters (URBN). The parent of the Anthropologie and Urban Outfitter chains reported a strong first-quarter beat, including a 280% surge in earnings.

The remainder came from its lumber-products manufacturing business.The outfit has reported three quarters of accelerating revenue growth. Earnings growth upshifted into triple-digit gains in the first quarter.The stock has gained 70% over the last 12 months.

484,CL,"Verizon Communications (VZ) stock climbed Tuesday as analysts pondered whether Amazon.com (AMZN) or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google loom as a more likely internet video partner when the telecom launches 5G residential broadband services in late 2018.Verizon hosted an analysts meeting late Monday where it touted its next-generation, 5G wireless strategy. Verizon told analysts that it will announce an OTT (over-the-top) partner in the fall when it expands 5G services to more markets. OTT is industry jargon for live TV or on-demand video delivered via broadband connections to homes.Verizon, which acquired AOL's and Yahoo's internet businesses, also updated analysts on the digital advertising platform being developed by its Oath-branded subsidiary.Oath's digital-ad products compete with Google and Facebook (FB).

Amazon sells subscriptions to other video services, such as HBO, Showtime and Starz.Amazon, though, does not sell live TV content, unlike Google's YouTube or Hulu.""Amazon could make sense as an ideal way to leverage massive subscriber scale,"" Synesael said in a note to clients Tuesday. ""If Verizon goes the (virtual) MVPD route, YouTube TV could make sense.""Virtual MVPD, or multichannel video programming distributor, is industry lingo for selling services similar to that of a cable TV operator.AT&T (T) offers its own internet video services, while Hulu has partnered with Sprint (S). Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner (TWX). AT&T could become a part owner in Hulu if its acquisition of Time Warner is approved.T-Mobile US (TMUS), meanwhile, offers Netflix to its wireless subscribers. Analysts say it's doubtful that Verizon would team with Dish Network (DISH), a satellite TV broadcaster that has an internet video service.Analysts say Verizon stated at Monday's meeting that it has no plans to acquire a media company.""CEO Lowell McAdam firmly reiterated that Verizon sees no reason to jump into a 5G world and get into the linear content game,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, in a report.

495,CL,"A China-based new issue snapped free of its IPO base Tuesday and Wednesday, and Boise, Idaho's largest building products manufacturer remained in a buy range after a Friday breakout.But bank stocks Wednesday occupied nearly half of an Investor's Business Daily screen showing 32 stocks hitting new highs during the session, according to preliminary calculations. All of those were regional banks, most responding to banking reform legislation passed Tuesday and awaiting only a signature from President Trump in order to become law.The bill, among many other things, rolls back compliance oversight on banks managing between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets. All of the banks in that range which were hashing out new highs Wednesday traded well below the 400,000 share-per-day minimum required for CAN SLIM-grade stocks.Another new high went briefly to Urban Outfitters (URBN). The parent of the Anthropologie and Urban Outfitter chains reported a strong first-quarter beat, including a 280% surge in earnings. But sellers took control of the stock shortly after the open, driving the stock down nearly 1%. Shares remained extended above a 36.20 buy point.China-based IPO OneSmart International (ONE) trades more than 500,000 shares per day on average. The company provides after-school educational services for kindergarten through 12th grade students, similar to the much larger TAL Education Group (TAL).TAL has been among the top China-based stocks, rising 111% over the past year. On Wednesday, the stock was in a buy range above a 43.58 flat base buy point. However, the base was very late stage. That meant the breakout bore an above-average risk of failure.OneSmart is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Shares spiked 9% Tuesday and 10% on Wednesday. That left the stock 23% above its March 28 IPO price and extended above an 11.96 buy point in a three-week IPO base.IPOs can be wild, and OneSmart is no exception. The stock dived 22% below its IPO price April 30. That set the stage for the stock's first consolidation. Investors who jumped in at the buy point will want to make sure they stick hard-and-fast to the rule that triggers an automatic sale when a stock falls 7% to 8% below its buy point.Boise Cascade (BCC) retouched its high from Tuesday during Wednesday's session. It then pulled back, remaining well within buy range above a cup-with-handle buy point at 45.20.Boise earned 85% of its 2017 revenue through distributing building materials made by other manufacturers. The remainder came from its lumber-products manufacturing business.The outfit has reported three quarters of accelerating revenue growth. Earnings growth upshifted into triple-digit gains in the first quarter.The stock has gained 70% over the last 12 months. But its base is a second-stage pattern, which suggests the stock may have some room to run before a more serious consolidation is necessary.Boise peer TopBuild (BLD) also scored a new high Wednesday. The insulation contractor and building supplies distributor climbed to 2% above an 82.36 buy point in a fourth stage flat base.You May Also Be Interested In:Amazon, Microsoft Price Targets Raised On Cloud Computing LeadershipWhich Stocks Show A Rising Trend In Their Relative Strength Line?7 Key Ways To Play Chip Stocks As This Leader Soars AgainTrack The Market: Stock Market TodayUnderstand The Market: The Big Picture

506,CL,"Stocks dug into substantial early losses early Tuesday, as an intensifying U.S.-China trade spat triggered a deep sell-off across Asian stock markets. China trade-sensitive stocks, including Boeing (BA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), posted heavy declines on the Dow and the Nasdaq 100.A broad range of China stocks spearheaded the early losses. JD.com (JD), Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU), Huya (HUYA) and JinkoSolar (JKS) were among the deepest decliners.The Dow Jones industrial avereage came off opening lows, but was down 1.2% shortly after the start of trade. Boeing and Caterpillar (CAT) led the downside. More than half of the Dow's 30 issues fell more than 1%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each shed 0.7%. About a dozen S&P 500 names sold down more than 2%. China trade sensitive names CF Industries (CF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and General Motors (GM) fell furthest.China names were among the Nasdaq's worst decliners. JD.com, NetEase and Baidu had three of the Nasdaq 100's four worst losses.Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors continued to ping-pong on U.S.-China news, as the Senate passed a bill Monday that would reinstate stiff penalties vs. China telecom giant ZTE Corp. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been attempting to acquire the NXP in a $43 billion deal which China's regulators reportedly approved last week. But the approval had been hitched to President Trump's forgiving ZTE for its violations of trade sanctions vs. North Korea. On Tuesday, NXP dropped 1.8% to one of the Nasdaq 100's deepest early losses. Qualcomm was down 1.6%.The Dow has five straight declines under its belt, falling back below the 25,000 level on Monday. The index appears headed for a break of its 50-day line at Tuesday's open, although premarket action does not always follow through into regular trade.  The S&P 500 ended Monday 3% above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq remains just a fraction off Thursday's high, and 5% above its 50-day level.With 25% tariffs on $50 billion on imports from China set to kick in on July 6, China has said it would impose equal penalties on U.S. imports. If those tariffs go into place, President Trump on Monday said he would increase the scope of U.S. tariffs to $200 billion worth of China goods.As a result, Asian stock markets careened lower Tuesday. The yuan dropped to a five-month low against the dollar and investors scrambled to get out of the way of the worsening trade dispute. The Shanghai Composite swooned 3.8%, the Shenzhen Composite dived 5.3% as more than 1,000 stocks hit their daily 10% loss maximum circuit breaker. The selling quickly infected Japan's market, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plummeted 1.8%, cutting below its 50-day moving average.Asia's rout moderated somewhat in Europe, where markets traded sharply lower in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX fell hardest, down 1.3%. The CAC-40 in Paris was 1.2% in the red, while London's FTSE 100 dimmed 0.5%.Sellers went after a number of China-based stocks in early U.S. trade. JinkoSolar dropped more than 4%. JD.com, Ctrip and Weibo (WB) all showed losses deeper than 3%.  Among the scorching-hot trio of China IPOs: Huya, iQiyi (IQ) and Bilibili (BILI), gtwo reversed premarket losses and punched higher: Huya gained a fraction. IQiyi scored a 3% gain. All three stocks are due for price consolidation, and pullbacks could present investors with buy opportunities.Another China-based IPO, Sogou (SOGO), broke out on Friday, then retook its cup-base buy point Monday in a huge-volume gain. Shares dropped 3.8% before Tuesday's open, holding just above the base's 14.80 buy point.China names also led the early declines among IBD 50 stocks. China Lodging (HTHT) dropped 3.6%. YY (YY) fell 1.9%. Momo (MOMO) dumped 3.7%. The declines did not do significant damage to the charts of either China Lodging or Momo.The loss dealt a setback to YY, which has been struggling to build the right side of a three-month base pattern.On the Dow, Boeing unraveled 3.2%, cutting below support at its 10-week moving average in heavy trade. The stock is trading below a 365.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. A fall below 335.89 would trigger the automatic sell rule.Verizon (VZ) scored one of the Dow's lonely early gains, rising 1%. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy, from hold. Verizon has been attempting to start up the right side of a four-month base pattern.China-based Autohome (ATHM) notched the deepest early loss among IBD Leaderboard names. Autohome dived 3.9% at Tuesday's open. The stock is extended after clearing an ascending-base buy point at 107.64 on May 30.In economic news, U.S. housing starts jumped more than expected in May. The Commerce Department reported starts rising to an annualized rate of 1.35 million for the month, up from 1.286 million in April and above consensus forecasts for an increase to 1.32 million.Building permits, which gauge upcoming building activity, slipped to an annualized pace of 1.301 million. That was down from April's 1.352 million pace and well short of views for a jump to 1.35 million starts.FedEx (FDX), Oracle (ORCL) and La-Z-Boy (LZB) report quarterly results after today's closing bell.(For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit stock news today)RELATED:Dow Slips, Techs Recover, Small Caps Lead; Tesla Extends GainsOnly A Stock Market Rout Can Avert A Trump Trade WarIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InThese Stocks Just Came On – And Off – IBD's Stock ListsIBD Stock Of The Day: Newest S&P 500 Member Blasts Into Buy Range

507,CL,"Lingering trade-war fears carried over to the stock market early Monday, but it ended up being a pretty good session for the bulls.

508,CL,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been on a tear lately. After putting in the bottom to its latest base in early April, the veteran chip stock has posted 10 up weeks in a row. It's hitting price levels not seen since January 2007.Judging from Monday's action, the buyers aren't tired yet.While the stock is now extended sharply past a 13.95 buy point in a large, deep double-bottom base, it may be worth keeping the stock on the watch list. Here are two reasons.One, a stock that rises that many weeks in a row is showing something special. Fund managers are serious about accumulating the stock. No wonder that AMD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also shot up to an A+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Two, fundamentals are getting white-hot at the Intel (INTC) rival in CPUs.Advanced Micro, which incorporated in 1969, ended two years of red ink by earning 13 cents a share last year. The Street sees earnings soaring 246% to 45 cents a share this year and rising another 33% to 60 cents in 2019.What's powering that solid profitability? Big sales. In the first quarter, Advanced Micro posted a 40% jump in revenue to $1.65 billion. That increase topped growth of 19%, 26% and 21% in the prior three quarters.Q1 gross margin jumped 400 basis points vs. the year-ago quarter to 36%, and the Santa Clara, Calif., company cut its operating expense as a ratio of sales from 33% to 29%.""PC, gaming and datacenter adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a news release. Advanced Micro is clearly gaining traction in the area of GPUs, or graphics processors. The firm's computing and graphics segment vaulted 95% to $1.12 billion, offsetting a 12% slide in sales in the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom business unit.At this point, it would make sense to watch for the stock to take a rest and flash a follow-on entry point. Wait for the stock's first pullback to the 10-week moving average. This could take a while. The 10-week moving average is rising rapidly. But at 13.40, it's sharply below the current share price.A three-weeks-tight pattern would offer another potential follow-on buy point. But so far, there's no such formation.Elsewhere in stocks today, Estee Lauder (EL) cooled off on Monday after gaining more than 3% in each of the prior two weeks. Those gains enabled the cosmetics giant to rise past a 151.85 buy point in a nicely symmetrical cup with handle.The 5% buy zone goes up to 159.44.Autodesk (ADSK) muscled past a 141.36 buy point in a 14-week flat base that showed a mild correction of 14% from head to toe. The expert in computer-aided design software for manufacturers snapped a six-quarter streak of losses by earning 6 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in April. Sales picked up 15% to $556 million.Autodesk's latest flat base is part of a base on base. The first base: a three-month double bottom that featured a 119.34 buy point.FleetCor Technologies (FLT), also featured in IBD's Stock of the Day column, gapped up powerfully at the open and rose as much as 6.3%. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a 213.84 proper entry in a long flat base.The fuel card provider has expanded into business transactions markets outside the fuel market via new acquisitions. Key new markets include tolls, corporate payments and lodging. FleetCor has delivered decent to solid double-digit profit and sales growth for six quarters in a row.RELATED:Inside The IBD 50: To Gain An Edge On The S&P 500, Use This TechniqueWhat Is The 3-Weeks-Tight Chart Pattern, And How It Helps Make Money In StocksThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

509,CL,"Large-cap techs showed mixed action in stocks today, but the Nasdaq still outperformed the Dow Jones industrial average. Small caps also excelled. The S&P 600 rose 0.6%.At 1045, the small-cap S&P 600 has rallied 11.6% since Jan. 1.The Nasdaq composite edged less than 1 point ahead, better than a 0.4% drop for the Dow Jones industrial average and a 0.2% decline for the S&P 500.Intel (INTC), a member of all three key indexes, slid more than 3% and dipped as low as 52.34 as volume grew 36% above average. The stock also undercut its key 50-day moving average but bounced decently off the session low.Watch to see if institutions shore up the stock. A leading issue that surrenders the 50-day or 10-week moving average and fails to rebound back above it is providing a defensive sell signal.The chipmaking giant holds a respectable 90 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99. Keep in mind, though, that the Composite Rating helps investors select top growth stocks. It does not serve as a timing tool for selling.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL) moved a bit further past a new breakout point of 1,161.20, or 10 cents above the handle's high in a 4-1/2-month double-bottom base.The Google search engine owner and Waymo self-driving technology firm rose 2% to 1,183. The stock would have to rise more than 5% past the 1,161.20 entry point, or to 1,219.26, to exit the proper buy zone.Wall Street sees earnings growth slowing in the second and third quarters of this year, at 8% and 10%. But full-year earnings are seen rising 24% to $44.36 a share. That would mark the third year in a row of 20%-plus profit gains.Analysts also see revenue climbing 24% and 22% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Full-year revenue target: $136.12 billion, up 23%.Alphabet is investing $550 million in the Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (JD). The two strategic partners aim to build ""next generation retail infrastructure solutions"" that provide ""personalized and frictionless shopping experiences.""Beijing-based JD increased its revenue 41% last year to $54.19 billion, an annual record.JD is also highly profitable. The big-cap firm earned 50 cents a share in 2017, up 233%. The stock is forming the right side of a new base.Going back to the semiconductor sector, Intel arch rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), highlighted in today's IBD New Highs feature, jetted more than 4% higher to 17.08. Volume pushed 82% above its 50-day average, a sign of heavy institutional buying.The Composite Rating in the GPU and CPU manufacturer is now a solid 90 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.Companies that are helping grow sales, expand business markets, and facilitate transactions continue to thrive amid signs that the U.S. economy is accelerating.Square (SQ) rushed 2.7% ahead to 66.20 in average turnover. The innovator in point-of-sale technology for small- and medium-size businesses is extended after rising past a 57.29 buy point in a nine-week cup with handle. The base has elements of a double bottom as well.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings leaping 71% in the second quarter vs. a year ago to 12 cents a share. Earnings have grown 250%, 600%, 60% and 20% in the prior four quarters.TransUnion (TRU), one of 11 companies highlighted in IBD Leaderboard, rallied 0.5% to 71.53. The credit scoring and consumer financial information giant is still in buy range after sparking a follow-on entry point in a four-weeks-tight pattern. This pattern is just one week longer than the three-weeks-tight, which highlights tight trading in a stock leader after a healthy run higher.RELATED:Can This Veteran Chip Stock Double After Its Breakout?The Current Stocks On IBD LeaderboardTop Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50

521,CL,"How far will interest rates go up? Wall Street cannot make up its mind.Will the Federal Reserve reveal a more hawkish view on inflation and go for four rate hikes this year? Or will the U.S. central bank continue to adopt its steady approach and stick with just a quarter-point jump in both June and September?The futures market, at one point this past week, reflected a greater than 50% chance that the Fed will raise the Fed funds rate by another quarter point in December. That would push the rate to a 2.25%-2.5% range by year's end. But on Friday that probability dipped below 50%. Institutional trading desks focused a little more on U.S.-China trade issues, the powerful rebound in crude oil prices, and what impact a stronger U.S. dollar could have on the global economy.""We're probably in a more balanced position relative to where interest rates have been. They've now normalized short-term rates. QE (quantitative easing) is going away,"" Rich Familetti, president and CIO of New York-based LDI (liability-driven investing) expert Ryan Labs Asset Management, told IBD in an interview. The company also focuses on total return strategies in fixed income. ""It's common to see 100 basis points up or down (in rates) in any one year.""Familetti added he thinks the Fed would ""not risk a policy error"" by acting overly aggressive in raising the cost of money to prevent raging inflation. The reason: pushing rates up too fast increases the risk of putting a hard brake on the economy. But he's watching carefully for those sectors that have used more debt than the value of their assets or are showing cash flows that are not as stable as they may appear.No doubt, in a rising-rate environment, Wall Street has made up its mind about those sectors that normally carry a lot of loans on the balance sheet or may see declining business due to the new shift in the monetary cycle. Just look at the utility sector, which as of Thursday ranked dead last among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables.Homebuilding stocks, meanwhile, still seem to have the flu.Familetti's team looks at debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). IBD's method? See the ratio of long-term debt to shareholders' equity. In general, avoid companies that carry a ratio of more than 100%. That limit fluctuates depending on the industry and other factors.Within the IBD 50 through Thursday, seven companies (14% of the list) had a calculable debt-to-equity ratio topping 100%. The seven firms are Zebra Technology (ZBRA) (261% in 2017), LPL Financial (LPLA), Smart Global (SGH), Integra LifeSciences (IART), Netflix (NFLX), TransUnion (TRU), and PGT Innovations (PGTI). The median D-to-E ratio in IBD 50 firms: 28%.Of course, some firms belong to capital-intensive industries. So if the operating cash is robust, the fundamentals are likely sound. Consider Zebra. The inventory-tracking technology firm posted operating cash flow of $8.57 a share in 2017, above the $7.05 it earned in profits per share. In 2013, Zebra had cash flow of $3.38 a share and EPS of $2.85.You can check the debt-to-equity ratio for any company by seeing the fundamental data block on the weekly chart in MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service.Trade the IBD 50 efficiently via the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

532,CL,"Successful swing-trading strategy relies on the proper stock market environment. April wasn't great in that regard. But with a new crop of leaders showing promise, it might be time to turn the profit engine on again.When you suspect a bottom in a market correction, your first reaction shouldn't be to jump back in aggressively and blindly. A useful swing-trading strategy is to use test buys and see how they work. April was full of bearish reversals as the indexes marched to their 50-day moving averages. Single buys at a time reduced exposure as the market struggled. As test buys failed, cutting losses quickly avoided getting too hurt. There's no need to increase exposure until you start making progress. That's your defense.Pure Storage (PSTG) was a test buy used on IBD's SwingTrader last week. On May 7, it cleared an area of price resistance and joined at 21.70 (1). The RS line hit new highs, well before a price high, and volume looked heavier than average (1). That confirmed the strength and improved the odds of success.The gains came fast. By the end of the day, we achieved the 5% profit goal and took half profits just below that level (2). That is a day trade, technically, but shouldn't be a concern. Day trades happen rarely on SwingTrader. Certainly not enough to get you flagged as a pattern day trader.As is our custom, we also raised our stop to 1% profit above our entry. We don't want a solid gain to go negative. When pulling back that much, the danger increases that the stock may not find support. In most cases, even if the stop is hit, you still exit with an average of around 3% for the trade with both sells.Pure Storage flirted with the stop a couple times, then exited SwingTrader just below the stop at the time of our alert (3). Averaging both sells came to a 2.8% gain on SwingTrader by holding the stock for just one day. The stock did recover considerable ground by the end of the day. Pure Storage pushed to new highs the following day. Then, it hit the 10% profit goal from our entry the day after that (4).IBD'S TAKE: Want to hold for longer? Pure Storage was also added to IBD's Leaderboard on May 7. Leaderboard has a longer holding period with position trading over swing trading. Leaderboard performance is more than four times the S&P 500 right now. Trials are available. The strength in our test buy suggests an improved stock market for swing trading. The major indexes notched solid gains for five straight days and are back above their 50-day moving averages. We moved the market action from sideways trend to uptrend. It's a big difference from the reluctant gains and bearish reversals of April. But the five straight days of gains also gave us pause. It's a little late to get aggressive.That doesn't mean the opportunities are over. This is where a break in the move would be welcome. Friday was a good start. If the pause continues, we'll be looking for new setups. Stocks that show tight action and pullbacks to short-term moving averages should appear. If the stock market indexes can hold above their 50-day moving averages, it may still be early in the game for profit.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:To Swing Or Not To Swing: Market Trend Answers The QuestionA Market Pullback Could Be A Good Thing For Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

535,CL,"Worldpay (WP) on Thursday reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. The payments technology stock fell as its in-line outlook appeared to disappoint investors. But payments peer Green Dot (GDOT) was breaking out a day after reporting earnings.Green Dot joins larger payments stocks Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Square (SQ) within buy range.Worldpay earned 81 cents a share, up 19%, with revenue soaring 81% to $850.7 million. Those results beat expectations for 77 cents per share and $838 million, respectively. The sales jump followed the merger in January that created Worldpay — the purchase of Worldpay Group by payment processor Vantiv.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWorldpay sees Q2 EPS of 93-96 cents with revenue of $960 million to $980 million, compared to consensus for 94 cents and $978 million.The company also raised its full-year outlook, but perhaps not enough to excite investors, Nomura-Instinet analyst Dan Dolev suggested in a research note.For the full year, the company expects EPS of $3.71-$3.81 on sales of $3.81 billion to $3.9 billion. That outlook was up from a January forecast of $3.66-$3.76 EPS and revenue of $3.8 billion to $3.89 billion. Analysts had forecast EPS of $3.72 and revenue of $3.872 billion.Worldpay fell 3.25% to 81.74 in the stock market today, backing away from an 85.63 buy point from a flat base. The stock has a Composite Rating of 96, out of a best-possible 99.""Given new accounting standards, M&A impact, and lack of pure organic growth disclosures, results are difficult to digest, in our view,"" Dolev said.Meanwhile, Green Dot shot up 14.6% to 72.57, blasting past a 69.47 flat-base buy point after reporting earnings late Wednesday. The company provides prepaid cards, debit cards and other financial products in retail stores and online.Green Dot earned $1.40 a share, up 40% vs. a year earlier and 8 cents above consensus. Revenue ran up 24.5% to $315 million, above views for $296 million.Visa climbed 0.1% and was at the upper end of the 5% buy zone of a 125.54 entry of a flat base. Mastercard added 1.3% and was a few pennies above the buy zone from a 183.83 entry in a second-stage flat base. Square climbed 0.7% to 54.65. It's still in the 5% zone from a 52.60 double-bottom buy point cleared Tuesday.Global Payments (GPN), another payment processor, rose 1.2% to 115.97 as it works on a short base with a 119.04 entry.Payment processors sit between businesses and the banks that issue credit cards. They clear transactions and help move money between the customers paying for things and the companies selling products to them. As more commerce takes place online around the world, those companies have tried to pad their technological resources.The acquisition in January made Worldpay into a massive payments provider. The company processes billions of transactions across 146 nations and 126 currencies.Dolev, in a research note in March, called the combination a ""best-in-class global e-commerce asset."" During Worldpay's fourth-quarter earnings call in February, management said it continued to benefit from same-store sales gains and a ""pretty strong"" economy in the U.S.Worldpay Group, the company Vantiv acquired to form the new Worldpay, serves a lot of businesses in the U.K. Management cited ""continued macroeconomic challenges in the U.K."" as negotiations to leave the European Union drag on.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Lessons From PayPal Stock, And 4 Keys To Make Money In 2018Top-Rated Global Payments Near Buy Zone With Earnings DuePayment Giant Visa Breaks Out On Earnings As Peers Make Bullish Moves

537,CL,"Oil & gas groups have risen to hold the largest share, four slots among the top 20 groups out of the industries tracked by IBD. Next in line are medical sector industries. Hospitals, medical products and outpatient care all hold top 20 positions.Any even faster-rising group — medical software — has gained 9% over the past four weeks. That lifted it into a No. 36 ranking on Friday, up from No. 120 six weeks ago.A surprising number of advancing stocks, namely Veeva Systems (VEEV), Medidata Solutions (MDSO), Teladoc (TDOC), Tabula Rasa (TRHC) and Evolent Health (EVH), are driving the advance.The group garnered added attention Friday, when Cerner (CERN) announced it had finally landed a deal to provide digital records-keeping tools to the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department. The $10 billion, 10-year contract had been left hanging by a thread after Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was fired in March.But Cerner's profits are wobbly and its shares, consolidating since January, are far from the top seed in the group.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOf more interest to CAN SLIM investors are Veeva and Medidata. Both companies are more profitable.

The stock is up 81% year to date, despite a failed breakout attempt in February and March.It holds a weak 35 EPS rating from IBD. But consensus views project a 167% earnings gain in Q1, and a 152% advance for the year.Another plus: Tabula's relative strength line has been slicing cleanly to new highs all year, a sign of comparative strength.Also worth keeping an eye on is Evolent Health. Its stock is staging an aggressive recovery, with a 59% gain since December 29. The company turned profitable in the first quarter, and now has five quarters of earnings acceleration under its belt.For the year, consensus views still project an 8 cent per share loss.

539,CL,"U.S. stock indexes stumbled Tuesday and losses persisted in midsession action. Homebuilders were among the hardest-hit stocks, as the 10-year yield reached 3.06%. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) slid about 4% and 2%, respectively, in brisk volume.The Nasdaq dropped 1.2% in the first half hour of trade but then trimmed the loss to 0.9%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.7%. Blue chips struggled as the Dow Jones industrial average receded 0.8%.The small-cap Russell 2000 did better, inching up 0.1%.Volume was running higher on both major exchanges compared with the same time Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDespite the ugly action, the major indexes remained above their 50-day moving average. The 50-day line is an important area to watch. The area had acted as resistance until recently, when the indexes retook the line. Now bulls are hoping the 50-day area can act as support.In stock market news today, homebuilders had their own battle going to find support.D.R. Horton, the second-biggest homebuilder by market cap, is down 18% so far this year, including Tuesday's dive. Lennar, the biggest by market cap, is off 16%.On Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that its housing index for May rose to 70. April's reading was 69, and analysts expected no change in May. The slight beat, though, had to contend with larger concerns about interest rates. (An index reading over 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good compared with those who view them as poor.)The 10-year yield popped to 3.06%. The yield was at 2.46% at the start of the year. Higher interest rates are generally regarded as a negative for home sales.In terms of earnings and revenue, Lennar and D.R. Horton are doing fine.Lennar grew earnings 594% in its most recently reported quarter, topping views by 44%. Revenue growth stepped up from 12% to 28%.D.R. Horton boosted earnings 42% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters. Revenue growth accelerated from 11% to 15% to 17%.A stock's fundamentals alone can't guarantee price gains. The homebuilder industry group is No. 182 in six-month price performance, among 197 industry groups.Among those 197 industry groups, losers led gainers by a 5-3 ratio. The best performer for the day was the food and dairy group. Food is regarded as a defensive investment.RELATED:Ford Motor Gets DowngradeOne Stock Chart Can Give Multiple InterpretationsDon't Rely On Investment Gurus

The San Francisco-based firm staged a breakaway gap past a 79.18 buy point on May 9 following sharp fiscal fourth-quarter results (earnings of 9 cents a share, revenue up 34% to $98.5 million, a quarterly record).(Read this Investor's Corner column on how to find an alternate buy point when a stock stages such a huge gap above the normal buy point.)New Relic holds an outstanding 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

543,CL,"The Nasdaq composite held up relatively well in afternoon trading Friday despite broad-based weakness in some semiconductor stocks. Applied Materials (AMAT) led a broad sell-off in chip-equipment stocks after reporting earnings and issuing a soft sales outlook. Shares plunged 7%. Lam Research (LRCX), ASML Holding (ASML) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also took hits in the group. Losses ranged from 2% to 3%.In late-afternoon trading, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were lower by around 0.2%. The Dow Jones edged up 0.1%, helped by strong performances from Boeing (BA), Home Depot (HD) and Caterpillar (CAT).Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Thursday's levels even as options expired. Options expiration can sometime result in unusually high volume.Headed into Friday, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line was near highs despite two declines in the prior three sessions. Healthy breadth is partly due to the strong performance of small caps in recent days. The Russell 2000 was on pace for its third straight all-time closing high Friday.Meanwhile, three high-quality names got price-target hikes, but Netflix (NFLX), Alibaba (BABA) and Nvidia (NVDA) all lost ground. Losses ranged from 0.1% to 0.3%.In stock market results today, PayPal (PYPL) was a nice winner, rising 2% to 80.87. The company announced plans to acquire European payments provider iZettle for $2.2 billion in cash. PayPal is approaching an 84.09 double-bottom entry.

545,CL,"Chinese video streaming firm iQiyi (IQ) has rallied in four of the past five sessions, rose as much as 14% intraday Monday, and made a new high of 32.40.So, is the recent price action a climax run, and thus a sell signal?No. The quick reason: iQiyi simply hasn't shown the necessary size of gains that typically precede this offense-type sell signal.In a climax run, a stock goes up in a nearly vertical manner after rising steadily for months or years. Statistically, the stock will also rise 25% to 50% within the span of just a couple of weeks. It may also rise in seven of the past eight trading sessions, or in eight of 10 days.IQiyi has vaulted 42% in just five sessions. But in a typical climax run, most market leaders will have broken out of a base and rallied for a minimum 18 weeks. They usually will have already doubled, even tripled, in price, before staging the climax run. IQiyi fails to meet these criteria. The company debuted less than three months ago on March 29, pricing its IPO at 18 a share.At Monday's peak, the total gain was 80%.Still, the big swing seen in Monday trading is enough justification for holders to take at least some profits off the table. Why? IQiyi broke out of a three-week IPO base on May 10, bolting past a 20.60 buy point. The gain from that proper entry has now exceeded 50%.One of IBD's top offense-type sell rules is this: Take gains in most of your stocks when the breakout achieves a 20% to 25% advance from the proper buy point. If you have huge conviction in the company, then aiming for a 30% to 50% gain is fine. But at some point, you'll want to lock in gains before the winner goes into a natural price correction.The Baidu (BIDU) spinoff is seen as the Netflix of China, providing a platform for high-quality videos over the internet. In addition to original content, iQiyi also offers live broadcasts, online games and books and e-commerce services.The company's sales jumped 56% to $2.6 billion in 2017, but the company also lost $3.86 a share.Analysts see iQiyi posting a net loss of $1.37 a share this year and a loss of $1.09 in 2019.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) established a new follow-on buy point, a four-weeks-tight pattern as it unveiled new products and upgrades. Shares rose more than 1% and got as high as 193.41, 1.5% above a 190.47 entry. Volume is running below average as of Monday afternoon action.The four-weeks-tight is an extension of the three-weeks-tight pattern. The tight action reflects an unwillingness among institutional holders to sell their shares.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: What Is A Climax Run?The Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow Much Are These Companies Crushing The S&P 500 This Year?

The bank set the rate, which links the yuan to the dollar, at 6.4586. The surprise move halted the yuan's steep, two-day slide. It also eased global concerns that China might devalue the yuan and allow its stock markets to suffer the consequences in response to the country's trade standoff with the U.S.China's stock markets responded by kicking up out of mixed trade to a solid finish. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 0.8%, but remained down 2% for the week.Global currencies reacted to the PBOC move with an uptick in confidence. The euro rose against the dollar, while the dollar gained vs. the yen. Government bond run-ups in Germany and the U.S. paused.

Fox agreed to the deal, which would give Fox shareholders 19% of Disney ownership following the transaction.  Fox shares ended Tuesday 15% above a flat base buy point at 38.66. Disney shares were up 0.7% in early action. The stock is mired in a 13-month consolidation.Comcast (CMSA), who's earlier bid was topped by Disney's new offer, rose 0.7% in early trade.Winnebago hitched up an 10% opening gain, after reporting above-forecast earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter.

Oracle dropped 4.1% after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results.Netflix powered up 1.4% at the start of trade. The streaming entertainment titan rammed nearly 4% higher against a falling market Tuesday, lifted by a trio of analyst upgrades. The gain points the IBD Leaderboard stock to an open more than 20% above the stock's 338.92 buy point from a May breakout. That would place it in a profit-taking zone.Facebook opened 1.6% higher.

550,CL,"When a company posts high pretax margins year after year, the situation points to two realities.The first reality is that the company is doing something right. The second is that the company might be operating in a space where high profit margins are the rule, not the exception.Take a look at three stocks that have appeared recently in the Big Cap 20 with the best pretax margins.The three are Mastercard (MA), E-Trade (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).See a trend? Yes, the money businesses are places where high margins are commonplace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn that situation, how should an investor respond? Should the investor buy shares and then sit back and watch the stock price rise?If only it were that simple.When weighing stocks with high pretax margins, the investor should ask two questions.How do those margins look vs. companies in the same industry group? (Maybe in that context they are not so high after all.)And how do the margins compare to the company's history? (In some cases, margins may be declining.)Mastercard posted a pretax margin of 53.6% in 2017.In the eight previous years from 2009 to 2016, Mastercard's average pretax margin was 51.9%.The highest was 55.1% in 2013. The lowest was 44.1% in 2009.Within the credit payment processor group, only one stock in 2017 had a higher pretax margin than Mastercard — Visa (V), which had a 64.7% pretax margin last year.E-Trade Financial pegged a 45.9% pretax margin in 2017. In three of the previous eight years, the company lost money. The average pretax margin in the remaining five years was 25.7%.Does that sound like a problem? It isn't. Pretax margin stepped up in each of the past five years — 17.2% in 2013 and then 25.3%, 36.6%, 41.4% and 45.9%.Within the brokerage group, two stocks had a higher pretax margin than E-Trade — Interactive Brokers (IBKR) (pretax margin 54.4% in 2017) and MarketAxess (MKTX) (50.9% in 2017).Charles Schwab achieved a pretax margin of 42.4%. This represented the fifth consecutive year of increasing pretax margins.The average pretax margin over the previous eight years was 31.8%.In the brokerage group, the three aforementioned brokerages did better than Schwab on pretax margin — Interactive Brokers, MarketAxess and E-Trade.Although profit margins are important, the full range of CAN SLIM criteria should be considered before buying a stock.In some cases, a strong stock may have thin margins. Amazon.com (AMZN) had a pretax margin of 2.1% in 2017. Netflix (NFLX) delivered a pretax margin of 4.2% last year.

On Friday, shares got as high as 85.45, posting a weekly advance of more than 13%.It was a terrific gain, but even that pales in comparison with the 53% catapult in the prior week.The strong move clearly makes the platform for digital ad purchasing extended from any IBD-style buy point. Before the breakout, Trade Desk seemed to be struggling in building the right side of an extra-deep cup base. From a peak of 67.30 to a low of 40.70, the 39.5% correction was deeper than the typical range for outstanding cup bases.So, why did the stock make such a eye-popping rally?As William O'Neil, IBD's founder, would often say, as much as 70% of a great growth company's value derives from its fundamental strength. The Ventura, Calif., firm has plenty of that. Earnings have vaulted 22%, 100%, 148%, 46%, 64% and 89% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Q1 earnings of 34 cents per share walloped the Wall Street consensus view by 240%.Revenue ramped up 61% to $85.7 million, a new record for the first quarter.

561,CL,"The Russell 2000 showed on Thursday that stocks today remain in a confirmed uptrend, at one point rising more than 0.6%. But the general market stumbled lower in afternoon trading on news reports that President Trump expressed doubt that the U.S. will make concrete progress in ongoing trade talks with China.Even as the major indexes deflated, market breadth remained positive. On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers by a 4-3 margin. On the NYSE, winners led by roughly 100 issues. And, at the Russell 2000's session high of 1627, the popular gauge of small-cap stocks is up almost 6% through nearly five months of trading in 2018.China's Baozun (BZUN), a small-cap e-commerce expert, cleared a 52.43 buy point in a new base. Shares reached as high as 53.90, up 19.5%, before pulling back some.Baozun has already seen 11 million shares exchange hands, more than double its float of 19 million. The stock trades on average 2.6 million shares a day.Baozun ranks No. 8 in IBD's current Global Leaders Stock List.At 2:30 p.m., the Russell 2000 advanced 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average slumped around 0.3%. The S&P 500 edged down 0.2%. (For more updates on stocks today, please check IBD's Stock Market Today section, found beneath ""Market Trend"" on the homepage of Investors.com.)Volume is mixed, running lower vs. the same time Wednesday on the Nasdaq but higher on the NYSE.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, shows that the FAANG stocks shouldn't be ignored either.The iPhone, iPad and digital services titan is not participating in the market's upside, but the nearly 0.6% decline in superdull volume (apologies for the stock-market-style oxymoron) is actually a good thing for Apple investors. Why? The stock is making a quiet pullback after thrusting nicely past a new buy point: 179.04, 10 cents above the 178.94 middle peak within a double-bottom base.The double bottom is one of seven critical chart patterns that every savvy growth stock investor can use to build positions at the precise moment that a true market leader breaks past historical price-resistance levels and ramps to a series of new highs.On Jan. 6, 2017, Apple initially broke out of a first-stage cup with handle that furnished a 118.12 correct buy point. IBD's Stock Market Today feature covered that breakout in real time as well as the setup of that key juncture in the stock's current turnaround story.Baozun, featured frequently in Investors.com and IBD Weekly over the past few years, helps multinational companies gain inroads into the Chinese consumer market. You can read more about what Baozun does in a June New America article.The stock has 19 million shares in the float and 55 million shares outstanding. The market value is just under $3 billion. Early on Thursday, Baozun posted a 29% increase in earnings to 9 cents a share. The first quarter appears to be one of Baozun's seasonally slowest periods. But that 29% EPS gain also comes on top of a 75% jump to 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.First-quarter revenue rose 25% to $146.4 million, the highest for any first quarter in the company's history. That result is almost the same as Baozun's full-year revenue in 2012.Keep in mind that the stock swings much more wildly than any S&P 500 firm. Thursday's breakout past a 52.43 buy point is from a late-stage pattern. This does not mean the breakout won't work. But the risk of a negative reversal and a breakout failure is higher.Baozun initially broke out of a long, deep, first-stage cup base near 10 in late August of 2016.Elsewhere in stocks today, Cisco Systems (CSCO) gapped down at the open and slid more than 3% to 43.56. The Nasdaq tech giant undercut its 50-day moving average and is now nearly 6% below a 46.26 buy point in a cup without handle.That decline is not enough to execute the golden rule of investing.Watch to see if the data networking pioneer can hold up close to and eventually retake the 50-day line. As reported by IBD earlier today, Cisco has announced a huge new stock-buyback plan.For those who bought at the 46.26 entry, investors would have to cut losses at 8%, or when Cisco hits 42.56.Lithium miner Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) dropped more than 4% to 55.24 in volume running nearly triple normal levels. Yet the sell-off does not wreck the current work on a new base being formed by the Chilean company.On April 5, Sociedad Quimica gapped up bullishly in price, leading to an eventual retaking of the 50-day moving average. That's a good sign. It means institutional investors are getting greedy again, showing renewed demand for shares.The Street sees SQM's earnings rising 10% to $1.80 a share this year and 17% in 2019. Over the past six quarters, earnings have lifted 320%, 82%, 77%, 19%, 105% and 35% vs. year-ago levels.That impressive record meets the C factor in CAN SLIM, IBD's seven-point paradigm for growth investing.

563,CL,"Investors in the biggest internet service providers on Thursday shrugged off passage of a U.S. Senate bill that would reverse the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of net neutrality rules.AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), and Comcast (CMCSA) edged up in early trades on the stock market today while Charter Communications (CHTR) was unchanged.The Senate voted 52-47 on Wednesday to reverse the FCC's rollback of net neutrality rules, a vote that signals potential harm to internet companies' business. One reason for mild investor reaction: Passage of a similar bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House.Further, President Donald Trump would need to sign the legislation if passed by both the Senate and the House. Trump would be undercutting Ajit Pai, whom he appointed as FCC chairman, if he signed the bill.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

It ended the day just off its intraday and all-time high of 190.37, reached just minutes before the close.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company now has a market value of about $960 billion. Some Wall Street analysts say it is on pace to become the first company with a market cap of $1 trillion.The nine-session winning streak for Apple stock would be the longest one since last July, when it also rose for nine straight trading days.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAfter last summer's nine-day rally, shares fell for the next three days, finding support at their 50-day moving average. Apple then rose 0.9% on Aug. 1 ahead of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report later that same day. The next day Apple soared 4.7% after delivering a beat-and-raise financial report the night before. The stock broke out of an 11-week flat base to record heights.Since 2004, Apple shares have risen nine consecutive days on six occasions, including the latest. On the previous occasions, the stock usually formed a base for about a month before resuming its move higher.Apple stock also has risen for 10 consecutive days twice since 2004, most recently in October 2010. Those are the longest winning streaks it has had in that time period.It has rallied lately on news that investment firm Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), led by Warren Buffett, has been increasing its stake in the iPhone maker.Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White on Thursday pounded the table for Apple. He rates the stock as buy with a price target of 235.""We believe Apple is on a path to surpass the $1 trillion market capitalization milestone in the coming months,"" he said in a report. He pointed to Apple's strong earnings report last week and Buffett's positive comments and investment for his confidence.If Apple traded at the average price-earnings multiple of other consumer-related stocks such as Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate Palmolive (CL), Apple would already have a market cap north of $1 trillion, he said.RELATED:Apple Within Spitting Distance Of $1 Trillion Market Cap

565,CL,"With as many as seven oil and gas-related industry groups rising 1.8% or more in stocks today, an investor shouldn't be surprised to see more names in that sector run to new highs. On Thursday, they included brand-new IPO Apergy (APY), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), and oil drilling firm Transocean (RIG).Apergy, which debuted on the NYSE as a spinoff of industrial equipment firm Dover (DOV) on May 9, moved to a new high after rising 4.3% to close at 43.90. That marked a fourth straight advance.While cup bases should be a minimum six weeks in length and flat bases at least five weeks, IPO bases can be extraordinarily narrow in width, as short as seven days. In Apergy's case, the five-day pullback was too short to be a proper IPO base.Apergy hit a high of 43.11 on its market debut, then fell the next two sessions. Notice on a daily chart how Apergy refused to go below the intraday low of its first trading session as an independent new company.That said, what tail winds benefit the drilling technology expert?Apergy's oil drilling industry group has scaled up the six-month performance rankings among IBD's 197 industry groups. As of Wednesday's close, the group ranked No. 22, up from No. 91 just six weeks ago.Given that oil is a commodity and thus the industry is highly cyclical, investors should expect Apergy's annual results to swing. And swing they have.In 2014, the Woodlands, Texas-based firm earned a robust $2.88 a share. But the next year, earnings plunged 77% to 67 cents a share. And in 2016, Apergy suffered a net loss of 16 cents a share. In 2017, it returned to the black, earning $1.43 a share as sales picked up 34% to $1.01 billion.Sales fell sharply in 2015 and 2016, down 30% in both of those years.Analysts expect Apergy's earnings to fall 11% to 32 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Apergy's products include plunger lifts, rod pumping systems, progressive cavity pumps, and electric submersible pump systems.Transocean, Apergy's industry group mate, rallied past 14 for the first time in more than 14 months. The stock climbed 0.11 to 13.71 after erasing most of the day's gains.Transocean is climbing out of a deep first-stage bottoming base. Go to a monthly chart, and you'll see why. The stock remains 92% below an all-time peak of 163, set in May 2008. (Go to MarketSmith to see historical daily, weekly and monthly charts.)In the near term, the global expert in offshore deep-ocean drilling surpassed a 12.50 buy point in a 13-week cup without handle on April 18. The stock didn't get very far, though, and pulled back for nearly three weeks. That decline, in turn, can be seen as a downward slanting handle on the giant cup base.Thus, a new buy point emerged at 12.85, 10 cents above the handle's high. Transocean rushed past that new entry on May 9 in excellent volume, up 65% vs. its 50-day average.Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell, the global integrated energy giant, rose more than 1% to 73.33 in about average volume. On May 9, the stock cleared a 71.79 buy point in a nearly 15-week cup with handle.Royal Dutch Shell remains in buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 75.38.In other sectors, Baozun (BZUN) gained more than 18% as it moved past a 52.43 buy point in an undefined seven-week cuplike base.

Shares advanced over 1% Monday amid a report that the airplane maker is expected to win another order for its 787 Dreamliner.The Dow stock is in the midst of a big move since October 2016 and the current base structure is a later-stage base. Late-stage bases have less upside than earlier stages. Two weeks ago, the stock moved past an early entry at 348.67 at a handle entry only viewable on the daily chart.In the latest quarter, earnings and sales growth came in at 68% and 6%, respectively.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEstee Lauder (EL) has rallied back above its 50-day line after a steep sell-off in early May. Now, the stock is trading just under a V-shaped cup with handle's 151.85 buy point. Shares found necessary support at their 50-day line Friday.A potential flaw is the stock's relative strength line. It descended rapidly in conjunction with the stock price in early May. Even though the stock has recovered near its old highs, the RS line still has a good deal of work ahead of it before it hits a new high.The base is shallow enough that it can also be interpreted as a flat base with a 153.98 buy point.The cosmetics maker boasts six quarters of accelerating revenue growth — from 1% to 18% in the most recent quarter over that time period.Leading brokerage firm TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is rallying back above its 50-day line, as a flat base entry at 63.11 looms ahead. Shares had a strong move after a breakout above a cup with handle's 47.36 in September.But financials have been weak over the last several weeks. Rival Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is triggering the 7%-8% sell signal from a flat base's 74.21 buy point.TD Ameritrade's earnings and sales grew 66% and 57%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period.On the downside, the stock has a weak D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. The rating measures institutional buying and selling over the last 13 weeks.Tip: Before making any investment decisions, be sure to check current market conditions, and use IBD Stock Checkup to see if your stock gets passing ratings for the most important fundamental and technical criteria.

Meanwhile, retailers Best Buy (BBY) and Ross Stores (ROST) also  are near buy points in this classic bullish formation.A cup-with-handle base is a stock chart pattern that dips, and then ascends, forming a trajectory that resembles the shape of a cup.

The midpoint of the handle must be above the midpoint of the base.Cup-with-handle formations can be as long as seven weeks to a year, but many run for three to six months.

588,CL,"Even the best stocks eventually start to waver and break down. It's a law of the market. So, recognizing those signals is crucial in learning how to invest with consistent success. Don't focus simply on buying. Learn how to keep your hard-earned gains in a hot stock and sell at the right time.XIndeed, mastering IBD's more than two dozen sell rules will help you succeed over the long term in the stock market.Some of those signs are as obvious as a hammer to the head, like a gap down on earnings. Others are more subtle, like a low-volume rebound after a sharp break. Normally, multiple sell signals coincide, giving investors both upside and downside reasons to sell a stock and lock in profits.Let's take a look at Ambarella (AMBA) in the summer of 2015. The system-on-a-chip designer made a big move due to its relationship with GoPro (GPRO). GoPro — the hyped camera-on-a-stick maker — went public at a 24 IPO price and quickly ran up to 98.47. But that lofty valuation was quickly shattered. The stock plummeted to an all-time low of 4.42 just this month — 95% off that all-time high. This year, the company announced that it was leaving the drone market due to an extremely competitive aerial market.Ambarella broke out above a 33.91 buy point in a cup with handle on Aug. 29, 2014 (please see a historical chart at MarketSmith). From there, the stock did a solid job of maintaining its 10-week line — a key support level. The week ended Feb. 13, 2015, saw the stock close significantly below its 10-week line for the first time since the breakout. But volume was just slightly above average. When you see a severe break below the 10-week line in volume that jumps 40% above average, it's time to sell.Three months later, the stock went into a climax top, allowing investors to lock in a big gain, while the stock was still advancing.On June 22, shares plunged nearly 21% (1) to 94.36 in huge turnover. Short-seller firm Citron Research published a report calling its stock appreciation ""ridiculous."" Investors couldn't be blamed for selling some shares that day given it was the stock's biggest one-day point break since the start of the move — a defense-type sell signal.Over the next month, the stock would slowly rebound back to new highs. The price action was positive, but volume was clearly telling a different tale. Only one day, July 23, showed a significant increase in volume vs. the 50-day average (2), but it was a stalling action. That day, shares rallied as much as 5.5% to hit a new high at 129.19, but closed with a meek 0.4% gain. Institutions anxiously unloaded their positions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor Ambarella holders, this lack of volume on the rebound was a clear sign that institutions were no longer interested in buying large quantities of shares at higher price levels.Two months later, the stock was cut in half.RELATED:Stock Market Indicators: This One Can Act Like A Canary In The Coal MineHow To Trade Stocks: Breakaway Gaps And The Art Of The BreakoutApple, Tesla, Alibaba Earnings; Facebook Holds F8: Investing Action PlanWhen To Sell Stocks: Amazon, Facebook, Boeing Triggered This Key Profit-Taking SignalTop Growth Stocks To Watch: Booking Holdings, E-Trade Added To IBD Stock Lists

589,CL,"Shares in Comcast (CMCSA) fell Tuesday as investors mulled fresh reports that the cable TV firm will pile on debt to finance an all-cash bid for 21st Century Fox (FOXA), aiming to break up its deal with Walt Disney (DIS).Comcast fell 5.6% to close at 30.59 on the stock market today. The cable and broadband giant is in talks with banks to obtain some $60 billion in bridge financing needed to bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox, said reports. Comcast has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.""The acquisitions of both Fox and Sky for nearly $100 billion in all-cash would dramatically change Comcast's leverage profile,"" said Scott Goldman, a Jefferies analyst in a report.Disney, which reports quarterly earnings late Tuesday, fell 0.7% to 101.79. Fox ticked down 3 cents to 37.45.Comcast on its first-quarter earnings call said it would not finance a major acquisition by issuing stock.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseComcast stock has struggled since the company's interest in Sky surfaced in February. With Tuesday's loss, the cable TV firm is down 22% in 2018.Walter Piecyk, analyst at BTIG Research, said in an April 27 blog that Comcast would likely suspend its stock buyback plan but keep dividends in place if it makes an all-cash bid for Fox.""An all-cash transaction at a 25% premium to Disney's bid would mean that Comcast would be assuming $26 billion of debt and raising an additional $82 billion of debt, bringing total net debt to nearly $170 billion pro forma,"" Piecyk wrote. ""That sounds like a nearly impossible level of debt to sustain. However, consider first that AT&T (T) (with) Time Warner (TWX) will have $135 billion of net debt if the deal closes and Verizon Communications (VZ) currently has $117 billion of net debt.""Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, produces enough free cash flow to temporarily increase leverage, says Piecyk.The company is waiting for a judge to rule next month on the Justice Department's challenge to AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner before it submits an offer to Fox.""Any deal would hinge on a favorable ruling in the pending AT&T-Time Warner merger, which would provide a green light for the merger of Comcast's distribution assets with the content-rich Fox entertainment assets,"" added Goldman.Comcast was co-founded by Ralph Roberts in the 1960s.

594,CL,"Monopoly: Calls to break up tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google have been increasing. But while the sentiment is understandable, the free market is far more likely to tame these giants without any government intervention.We can remember when everyone was promising that the internet would unleash competition by lowering barriers to entry and often by cutting out the middle man. But in some ways the opposite has happened, as three companies wound up controlling the lion's share of online advertising and commerce.That, in turn, has generated growing interest in breaking these companies up, or heavily regulating them as monopolies.This past week, for example, a new coalition called ""Freedom From Facebook"" launched a petition calling on the Federal Trade Commission to spin off Facebook (FB) subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into competing networks.""Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power,"" the group says. ""It buys up or bankrupts potential competitors to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice.""Amazon (AMZN) is also coming under fire for its sheer size — it is on track to become the first company in history to reach $1 trillion in value.Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart, recently said that Congress should look into breaking up Amazon because it's ""destroying jobs, and it's destroying value in the (retail) sector,"" adding for good measure that ""it's anti-competitive, it's predatory, and it's not right.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNew York University professor Scott Galloway argues that breaking up these and other big tech firms ""could unleash another 20 to 30 years of unbelievable innovation and shareholder growth.""Calls to regulate and break up big companies are not new. In the 1990s, we heard the same claims made about Microsoft. It was too big and powerful and was hampering innovation, and the only solution was to break it up.History shows there's a better, faster, more efficient and more direct way to deal with companies that are ""too big."" Let the free market work. Time and again, giants of industry get toppled not by government regulators, but by new disruptive competitors.Sears in its heyday, for example, was essentially a combination of Walmart (WMT) and Amazon. It had a massive retail presence, and a massive mail order catalog (the internet of the day) business. Today it is barely breathing.The government never did break Microsoft up. But new competitors like Google (GOOGL) and Apple (APPL) fundamentally reshaped the marketplace in ways that severely hampered it.Another way to look at it is this: Of the 500 companies that made the Fortune 500 list in 1955, only 53 remain on that list, notes economist Mark Perry.Only two of the companies that ranked in the top 10 in 1955 are still on the list. And of the top 10 companies today, four didn't even exist in 1955.It's a virtual certainty that decades from now, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and others will have gone the way of Microsoft or IBM or Sears or Zenith Electronics or Kodak or Bethlehem Steel.

599,CL,"Chart readers know that a W-shaped base is called a double bottom. So why is RealPage (RP), with exactly that type of shape, being called a flat base?The reason and proper interpretation lies not just in the shape of the base but its overall dimensions. Identifying those will help you tell the difference between a proper buy point and an improper buy point.With the Nasdaq composite rebounding from a few sharp pullbacks of as much as 12% this year, many stocks have shadowed those price moves. That explains why in the past couple of months so many leading stocks have formed bases with two distinct lows, thehallmark of double-bottom bases. Evercore (EVR), a member of the IBD 50, is one stock climbing well from a double bottom.A double bottom not only must have two clear lows, but the second must undercut the first. This tells investors there's been a second shakeout of weak holders. From the start of the pattern, at least seven weeks must pass before a viable buy point emerges. The buy point is found by locating the middle peak in the base and adding 10 cents. That price should be in the upper half of the base. Back to the original question, why are some bases that look exactly that way considered flat bases? The key distinction is in the depth of these two types of patterns. Double bottoms normally decline as much as 33% from top to lowest point. By comparison, flat bases are shallower — less than 15% in depth. Another difference is that flat bases can form in as few as five weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRealPage had a total decline of 13%, which made it a legitimate flat base. Zebra Tech (ZBRA), the inventory tracking technology company, also had two distinct lows in its March-to-early-May base. But it wasn't deep enough for a double bottom. The stock corrected only 12% and was better interpreted as a flat base.This raises another question: In a flat base that resembles a double bottom, can the middle peak be used as a proper buy point? Normally, no. A flat base is already shallow enough, so the surest entry is when the stock makes a new high.But in some cases, an early entry can be identified in a flat base. In Zebra's case, 146.79 could have been used as a perfectly acceptable alternative entry. The stock surged past that level (and the prior high) on May 8 in heavy volume following an earnings report. There was little doubt that the lower entry was just as good as the higher.RELATED:5 Keys To Spot The Base On BaseWhat Does A Double-Bottom Base Look Like?

603,CL,"Even the best stocks eventually start to waver and break down. It's a law of the market. So, recognizing those signals is crucial in learning how to invest with consistent success. Don't focus simply on buying. Learn how to keep your hard-earned gains in a hot stock and sell at the right time.XIndeed, mastering IBD's more than two dozen sell rules will help you succeed over the long term in the stock market.Some of those signs are as obvious as a hammer to the head, like a gap down on earnings. Others are more subtle, like a low-volume rebound after a sharp break. Normally, multiple sell signals coincide, giving investors both upside and downside reasons to sell a stock and lock in profits.Let's take a look at Ambarella (AMBA) in the summer of 2015. The system-on-a-chip designer made a big move due to its relationship with GoPro (GPRO). GoPro — the hyped camera-on-a-stick maker — went public at a 24 IPO price and quickly ran up to 98.47. But that lofty valuation was quickly shattered. The stock plummeted to an all-time low of 4.42 just this month — 95% off that all-time high. This year, the company announced that it was leaving the drone market due to an extremely competitive aerial market.Ambarella broke out above a 33.91 buy point in a cup with handle on Aug. 29, 2014 (please see a historical chart at MarketSmith). From there, the stock did a solid job of maintaining its 10-week line — a key support level. The week ended Feb. 13, 2015, saw the stock close significantly below its 10-week line for the first time since the breakout. But volume was just slightly above average. When you see a severe break below the 10-week line in volume that jumps 40% above average, it's time to sell.Three months later, the stock went into a climax top, allowing investors to lock in a big gain, while the stock was still advancing.On June 22, shares plunged nearly 21% (1) to 94.36 in huge turnover. Short-seller firm Citron Research published a report calling its stock appreciation ""ridiculous."" Investors couldn't be blamed for selling some shares that day given it was the stock's biggest one-day point break since the start of the move — a defense-type sell signal.Over the next month, the stock would slowly rebound back to new highs. The price action was positive, but volume was clearly telling a different tale. Only one day, July 23, showed a significant increase in volume vs. the 50-day average (2), but it was a stalling action.

For instance, if an investor refuses to heed the 8% sell rule, or averages down on a stock, or buys late-stage stories, pain is likely.Yet knowing the rules thoroughly can bring an awareness of exceptions. Consider Apple (AAPL), for example.In June 2012, IBD published a column with this headline, ""Acting Normal Isn't In Apple's Recent History."" The article pointed out that Apple broke out of several late stage bases in 2006 and 2007 and posted nice gains.What were the factors that let Apple succeed where most breakouts would fail?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePart of the reason was Apple's fundamentals. Earnings jumped 60% to 32 cents a share in 2006. Don't a lot of stocks do the same? Yes, but this was only the second year that Apple had left the world of single-digit EPS increases. Growing earnings from a penny a share to six pennies a share — as Apple did in 2003-04 — isn't as impressive as big increases on top of sizable, year-ago earnings.In 2007, Apple grew earnings 75% to 56 cents share. Revenue grew 39% and 27% in the same two years.Institutional investors clearly saw a long-term, bullish picture for Apple. And that kind of conviction can allow a stock to win despite the base count.But enough about Apple. The Sector Leaders screen has four stocks that are either working on or recently broke out from a later-stage base. Do any of the stocks have what it takes to succeed from a later-stage base?Let's take a look at the four stocks.—China-based social-network provider Weibo (WB) is working on a fourth-stage base, according to MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology. Earnings rose 156% in 2016 and 120% last year.Revenue rose 37% and 75% in the same years.One drawback for Weibo is that the stock doesn't have a lot of quality institutional support. Also, the stock gapped down Wednesday after reporting Q1 results.—Chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) is shaping a third-stage consolidation. The company grew earnings 138% in fiscal 2017 and 79% in fiscal 2018 ended in January.Revenue increased 38% and 41%.Nvidia has institutional support, but Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) trimmed its position 22% over the past two quarters and Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX) sold 34% of its position over the past two quarters. Both Contrafund and Primecap are A+ funds.—Internet entertainment site Netflix (NFLX) is working on a third-stage consolidation. Earnings stepped up 39% and 191% in the past two years.Revenue rose 30% and 32% in the same periods.Netflix has good institutional support. The A+ funds are either adding shares, standing pat or trimming lightly.—China-based online marketplace Alibaba (BABA) is working on a third-stage consolidation.Earnings grew 31% and 46% in the past two fiscal years. The fiscal year ends in March. Revenue increased 47% and 62%.Alibaba has good institutional support with one dent. Over the past two quarters, Fidelity Contrafund unloaded 56% of its stake.Do any of these stocks look like another Apple?Netflix looks like the most likely, by virtue of its institutional support.

618,CL,"Even the best stocks eventually start to waver and break down. It's a law of the market. So, recognizing those signals is crucial in learning how to invest with consistent success. Don't focus simply on buying. Learn how to keep your hard-earned gains in a hot stock and sell at the right time.XIndeed, mastering IBD's more than two dozen sell rules will help you succeed over the long term in the stock market.Some of those signs are as obvious as a hammer to the head, like a gap down on earnings. Others are more subtle, like a low-volume rebound after a sharp break. Normally, multiple sell signals coincide, giving investors both upside and downside reasons to sell a stock and lock in profits.Let's take a look at Ambarella (AMBA) in the summer of 2015. The system-on-a-chip designer made a big move due to its relationship with GoPro (GPRO). GoPro — the hyped camera-on-a-stick maker — went public at a 24 IPO price and quickly ran up to 98.47. But that lofty valuation was quickly shattered. The stock plummeted to an all-time low of 4.42 just this month — 95% off that all-time high. This year, the company announced that it was leaving the drone market due to an extremely competitive aerial market.Ambarella broke out above a 33.91 buy point in a cup with handle on Aug. 29, 2014 (please see a historical chart at MarketSmith). From there, the stock did a solid job of maintaining its 10-week line — a key support level. The week ended Feb. 13, 2015, saw the stock close significantly below its 10-week line for the first time since the breakout. But volume was just slightly above average. When you see a severe break below the 10-week line in volume that jumps 40% above average, it's time to sell.Three months later, the stock went into a climax top, allowing investors to lock in a big gain, while the stock was still advancing.On June 22, shares plunged nearly 21% (1) to 94.36 in huge turnover. Short-seller firm Citron Research published a report calling its stock appreciation ""ridiculous."" Investors couldn't be blamed for selling some shares that day given it was the stock's biggest one-day point break since the start of the move — a defense-type sell signal.Over the next month, the stock would slowly rebound back to new highs. The price action was positive, but volume was clearly telling a different tale. Only one day, July 23, showed a significant increase in volume vs. the 50-day average (2), but it was a stalling action. That day, shares rallied as much as 5.5% to hit a new high at 129.19, but closed with a meek 0.4% gain. Institutions anxiously unloaded their positions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

619,CL,"Individual investors who ignore sound investing rules often pay a price. For instance, if an investor refuses to heed the 8% sell rule, or averages down on a stock, or buys late-stage stories, pain is likely.Yet knowing the rules thoroughly can bring an awareness of exceptions. Consider Apple (AAPL), for example.In June 2012, IBD published a column with this headline, ""Acting Normal Isn't In Apple's Recent History."" The article pointed out that Apple broke out of several late stage bases in 2006 and 2007 and posted nice gains.What were the factors that let Apple succeed where most breakouts would fail?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePart of the reason was Apple's fundamentals. Earnings jumped 60% to 32 cents a share in 2006. Don't a lot of stocks do the same? Yes, but this was only the second year that Apple had left the world of single-digit EPS increases. Growing earnings from a penny a share to six pennies a share — as Apple did in 2003-04 — isn't as impressive as big increases on top of sizable, year-ago earnings.In 2007, Apple grew earnings 75% to 56 cents share. Revenue grew 39% and 27% in the same two years.Institutional investors clearly saw a long-term, bullish picture for Apple. And that kind of conviction can allow a stock to win despite the base count.But enough about Apple. The Sector Leaders screen has four stocks that are either working on or recently broke out from a later-stage base. Do any of the stocks have what it takes to succeed from a later-stage base?Let's take a look at the four stocks.—China-based social-network provider Weibo (WB) is working on a fourth-stage base, according to MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology. Earnings rose 156% in 2016 and 120% last year.Revenue rose 37% and 75% in the same years.One drawback for Weibo is that the stock doesn't have a lot of quality institutional support. Also, the stock gapped down Wednesday after reporting Q1 results.—Chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) is shaping a third-stage consolidation. The company grew earnings 138% in fiscal 2017 and 79% in fiscal 2018 ended in January.Revenue increased 38% and 41%.Nvidia has institutional support, but Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) trimmed its position 22% over the past two quarters and Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX) sold 34% of its position over the past two quarters. Both Contrafund and Primecap are A+ funds.—Internet entertainment site Netflix (NFLX) is working on a third-stage consolidation. Earnings stepped up 39% and 191% in the past two years.Revenue rose 30% and 32% in the same periods.Netflix has good institutional support. The A+ funds are either adding shares, standing pat or trimming lightly.—China-based online marketplace Alibaba (BABA) is working on a third-stage consolidation.Earnings grew 31% and 46% in the past two fiscal years. The fiscal year ends in March. Revenue increased 47% and 62%.Alibaba has good institutional support with one dent. Over the past two quarters, Fidelity Contrafund unloaded 56% of its stake.Do any of these stocks look like another Apple?Netflix looks like the most likely, by virtue of its institutional support. But if the investor buys into a late-stage breakout, he or she should be ready to exit quickly if the stock turns south.RELATED:Rising Oil Prices Inspire Some BreakoutsHospital Stocks Are Outperforming: Time To Buy?Can A Great Stock Lead Again From A Late-Stage Breakout?

620,CL,"Strong earnings spawned breakouts for four highly rated stocks, and the earnings reports were as impressive as the stock gains.While the price moves were bullish, the general market remains under pressure. Investors, thus, need to be cautious with stock purchases.Carbonite (CARB) broke out of a cup-without-handle base in heavy volume, clearing a 33.65 buy point. The stock faded from its highest levels on Tuesday, which is not unusual given Carbonite's history with breakouts. The past five breakouts since 2017 have resulted in minor gains, with shares soon falling into new consolidations.Carbonite late Monday reported adjusted earnings of 27 cents a share, triple the year-ago profit. Sales climbed 12% to $64 million. The cloud storage company beat expectations. Carbonite has the highest IBD Composite Rating in the industry group, along with Smart Global Holdings (SGH). Moreover, the group is in the top 10 of the 197 that IBD tracks.Oppenheimer and Lake Street Capital raised their price targets on the stock to 35 and 34, respectively.Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) broke out past the 148.81 buy point of a flat base as shares gapped up on a bullish earnings report.Zebra smashed expectations, posting Q1 adjusted earnings of $2.56 a share, up 87%, on sales of $977 million, up 13%. The maker of inventory tracking tools and price scanners also raised its outlook. It forecast adjusted EPS of $2.20 on sales of $990 million for the second quarter.Trex (TREX) punched above the 120.50 buy point of a saucer pattern in huge volume. The stock gapped up and was trading near the entry in afternoon dealings.The world's largest manufacturer of fencing and decking products had a mixed Q1 report. Earnings topped views as EPS climbed 32% to $1.25. But an 18% increase in sales to $171 million lagged expectations. The company cited a strong early season, plus cost savings and higher capacity utilization.Trex also announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will be in the form of a stock dividend paid June 18 to shareholders of record on May 23.LPL Financial (LPLA) broke out of a cup without handle in active trading, though it did not report results Tuesday.The stock cleared a 66.74 buy point. The relative strength line also made a new high, but the base is a risky fourth-stage pattern. Much of the base formed below the 50-day moving average. The previous base, formed in October through a Dec. 4 breakout, also had a lot of trading below the line but still produced a 23% gain.On Tuesday, Credit Suisse raised the target price to 92 from 84 and maintained an outperform rating, Dow Jones reported.

627,CL,"A stock market correction can make investing prospects seem bleak. Your batting average suffers and it's hard to feel in step. But don't give up. Stocks showing relative strength during these times deserve special attention. They can bring the best swing trading profits when the market firms up.A return of volatility has already made the start of 2018 more challenging than 2017. January continued to build on the strength of the prior year but then things shifted. February saw more than a 10% correction in the Nasdaq composite. March was back to new highs. By the start of April, another correction of over 10% was underway. With the back-and-forth, making progress hasn't been easy.The fact that 2017 had no 10% stock market corrections was unusual. So, it may be helpful to revisit the stock market corrections of 2016 for insight to the current market conditions — and a ray of hope.The beginning of 2016 had its share of turbulence. January started with a rally failure and by February the Nasdaq composite languished nearly 20% off its high. A follow-through day in February offered a slow start for growth stocks initially. Still, there were plenty of successful swing trading opportunities by the time IBD's SwingTrader launched its beta version in March that year. Nvidia (NVDA), TAL Education (TAL), and Silicon Motion (SIMO) were among those early winners.The strong rally into April hit resistance just under 5000. Soon enough, the index was back below its 50-day moving average line and our batting average on SwingTrader started to suffer. But, as the stock market firmed, the stocks with spectacular relative strength stuck out. Semiconductor stock MaxLinear (MXL) was one of them.MaxLinear broke out of a base-on-base structure with double its average volume on May 16 (1). Its move to new highs occurred while the market was still recovering. That pushed its relative strength line to new highs sharply (1) and earned it a spot on SwingTrader.IBD'S TAKE: Relative Strength isn't just for swing trading. It was a factor for IBD's Leaderboard in picking Lululemon (LULU) as a winner. Though the stock didn't go straight up immediately, the 5-day moving average line easily contained its drops. By May 23, MaxLinear hit its 5% profit goal and we took half profits on the trade (2). As the market's strength grew, the semiconductor stock continued to pile on gains. The 10% profit goal hit on May 31 and we exited the remaining shares (3). The Nasdaq composite approached its prior resistance level of 5000 around the same time.Taking profits on the way up didn't get us out at the top. It usually doesn't. But it did save us the heartache of a nearly 20% correction in MaxLinear that transpired over the next month. More importantly, stocks showing relative strength when things look bleak can be your key to profits when the eventual market turn comes.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Relative Strength Line Identifies Strong StocksHere's How Swing Trading Strategy Helped Avoid A Stock Market Correction Swing Trading Strategies And Lessons

633,CL,"Retailing, apparel, consumer-spending and semiconductor-related stocks dominated the market's upside in stocks today, as major indexes sought to beef up their morning gains. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), meanwhile, reaffirmed a new trend of emerging institutional demand within the restaurant industry group.Chipotle, which is a new trading idea in IBD SwingTrader on Wednesday, rallied more than 3% to 440.27 in healthy turnover for what figures to be its fourth up day in a row.Chipotle's volume is running 52% above usual levels, hinting that mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are accumulating shares heavily.The stock ran in the short sellers on April 26 after reporting Q1 results that pointed to an ongoing turnaround in fundamentals. After that big jump, Chipotle traded tightly and volume dried up, forming a handle in the process. That positive action following the catapulting move in price in essence formed a handle and a 433.10 buy point within its new deep first-stage base.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite paced the key indexes with a gain of more than 0.7%. At 7405, the premier index of high-growth companies is now up 7.2% year to date. It advanced 28.2% last year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF rallied 1.2% to 35.25. The exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital, gained 34% in 2017.The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. A two-point drop by 3M (MMM) hampered the Dow Jones industrial average's advance. The blue chip index rose around 0.3%. Volume is running around 7%-8% lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use3M has been hit with heavy institutional selling ever since the Dow Jones industrial component and manufacturing giant cracked below the 50-day moving average in severe volume on Feb. 5, a key sell signal.Some sector indexes heated up even more.The PHLX Semiconductor index, also known as the SOX, winged 1.1% higher. Micron Technology (MU) broke out of a new double-bottom base at 54.37 in decent but not great turnover.Notice how in this nine-week double bottom, the middle peak of 54.27 is actually 10 cents beneath the midpoint of the actual base (45.31 low plus 63.42, giving a base midpoint of 54.37). You'd prefer to see the midpoint of a double bottom be firmly lodged within the upper half of the base.That said, Micron is still 11% below the base's 63.42 peak. In other words, it's possible for the stock to continue building the right side of the current base. Double-bottom bases can also form handles, which represent a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, and boost the chances of a successful breakout.Micron is a member of the strong data storage industry group. In that group, Smart Global (SGH) continues to act as a market leader as well. Shares, up nearly 4% to 47.33, are working on the right side of a potential cup pattern.Returning to the restaurant group, Wingstop (WING) and Shake Shack (SHAK) are showing robust action so far in 2018.The former has made a series of rebounds off the 50-day moving average after it cleared a 33.64 buy point in a 10-week flat base on Nov. 3, 2017. On that day, the chicken wing chain reported a 31% jump in earnings to 17 cents a share for the third quarter of 2017 as sales lifted 19% to $26 million.Since then, earnings have risen 13% and 19% in the prior two quarters. In IBD Stock Checkup, Wingstop ranks 5th within the Retail-Restaurants industry group with an 87 Composite Rating. That overall ranking belies a solid EPS Rating of 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the company's long- and short-term profit growth is superior to 88% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.Wingstop's Composite score is likely hurt by the fact that it doesn't have an SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating. Why? Wingstop does not have a calculable return on equity. As of the first quarter of 2018, the Dallas-based company showed a total stockholders' deficit of $146 million. Nonetheless, Wingstop posts excellent operating cash flow that has been higher than annual earnings per share for four years in a row.The Street sees Wingstop's earnings rising 14% to 83 cents a share this year and 19% to 99 cents in 2019.Shake Shack powered past a 44.50 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13, then blasted higher nearly two weeks later after the popular burger, crinkle cut fries, and shake chain posted a 50% bulge in adjusted Q1 profit and a 29% increase in sales to $99.1 million.Wingstop and Shake Shack are small cap firms with market values of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.3% to $71.08 a barrel. That decline didn't stop IBD 50 member Daqo New Energy (DQ) from rallying nearly 11% to 65.22 in hefty trade.The expert in making raw polysilicon for solar cell production is a wild stock, easily prone to swinging up or down 5% any given day. Nevertheless, the stock has now cleared a 65.09 entry point in a deep double bottom base and is in buy range.The 5% buy zone for Daqo goes up to 68.34.Daqo is No. 13 in the IBD 50.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is holding firmly above the 3% threshold, currently at 3.08%.Fed funds future now show a roughly 54% chance that the Federal Reserve will make four quarter-point hikes in short-term interest rates by December this year.RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point In Stocks: Maximize Your Return, Minimize Your RiskWhich Stocks Just Entered The IBD 50, Sector Leaders, And Other Key IBD Screens?

634,CL,"Stocks closed higher Wednesday in a broad advance that made up some of the prior day's sharp losses. Technology and consumer stocks were leaders.Indexes faded a bit in the closing moments, but held the bulk of the day's gains. The Nasdaq composite — getting some help from a strong technology sector — climbed 0.6% and closed 0.2% away from erasing all of Tuesday's 0.8% loss. The S&P 500 bounced 0.4%.The Dow Jones industrial average added less than 0.3%. Nike (NKE) was the best-performing Dow component. Shares broke out of a flat base and closed in buy range from the 70.35 buy point. Nike's breakout was symptomatic of strength in retail and other consumer stocks.But small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 adding 0.9% and making a new high. The Russell seemed to benefit from strength in technology, which is the index's largest sector weighting.

Advancers led decliners by a 2-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 9-to-5 on the NYSE.After the close, Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported earnings for the April-ended quarter. Shares fell 4% immediately after the report. Cisco closed regular trading near the 46.26 buy point of a cup with handle.Steel, airline, data storage and chip equipment were some of the best performing industry groups in the stock market today.In the steel industry, Steel Dynamics (STLD) broke out past the 50.80 buy point of an irregular base. Volume was only modestly above average, which dampened the bid for new highs. But the relative strength line also made a new high. Reliance Steel (RS) moved above the 93.83 entry of a cup with handle base. But the breakout also lacked vigorous volume.Consumer stocks also led, with apparel stores, consumer electronics, RVs, leisure products and restaurants in the top 20 of 197 industry groups.In biotechs, Codexis (CDXS) cleared a cup base with a 13.70 buy point. Volume was about 40% more than average. IBD 50 member Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) climbed 4% and bolstered its breakout past 184.89. Volume was heavy and the RS line made a new high.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was little changed but remained near seven-year highs.

635,CL,"Stocks faded Friday, as continued weakness in the energy sector led the market to a mixed close.Indexes recovered some in the final hour but still were lackluster. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.1% thanks to some relative strength in semiconductors stocks. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%. The Russell 2000 eased 0.1%.Preliminary data showed lower volume, not surprising on the Friday before a three-day weekend on Wall Street.

The ETF made a 52-week high Tuesday but reversed lower and continued to drop the rest of the week. Eight of the 12 worst-performing industry groups were oil related.With fuel prices falling, the transportation sector saw reason to climb. The Dow transports added 0.4%. Airlines were Friday's second-best industry group, with logistics, transportation equipment and airfreight up modestly.Another theme was the continued decline in bond yields. The bench mark 10-year Treasury note saw its yield fall 5 basis points to 2.95%. Yields fell after durable goods orders dropped more than expected in April, down 1.7%. It was the first decline since January and more than the 1.2% drop economists had forecast.Homebuilders, which have been facing higher mortgage costs as yields have risen for much of 2018, were another leading industry. The group rose 1.5% but remains depressed and most stocks in the group remain deep in corrections.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF was nearly flat. Oil stocks were some of the weakest in the IBD 50. WildHorse Resource Development (WRD) tumbled 3.5% and Cactus (WHD) 3.8%.But ZTO Express (ZTO), a fairly new member of the IBD 50, raced nearly 5% higher.

636,CL,"Monopoly: Calls to break up tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google have been increasing. But while the sentiment is understandable, the free market is far more likely to tame these giants without any government intervention.We can remember when everyone was promising that the internet would unleash competition by lowering barriers to entry and often by cutting out the middle man. But in some ways the opposite has happened, as three companies wound up controlling the lion's share of online advertising and commerce.That, in turn, has generated growing interest in breaking these companies up, or heavily regulating them as monopolies.This past week, for example, a new coalition called ""Freedom From Facebook"" launched a petition calling on the Federal Trade Commission to spin off Facebook (FB) subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into competing networks.""Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power,"" the group says. ""It buys up or bankrupts potential competitors to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice.""Amazon (AMZN) is also coming under fire for its sheer size — it is on track to become the first company in history to reach $1 trillion in value.Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart, recently said that Congress should look into breaking up Amazon because it's ""destroying jobs, and it's destroying value in the (retail) sector,"" adding for good measure that ""it's anti-competitive, it's predatory, and it's not right.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNew York University professor Scott Galloway argues that breaking up these and other big tech firms ""could unleash another 20 to 30 years of unbelievable innovation and shareholder growth.""Calls to regulate and break up big companies are not new. In the 1990s, we heard the same claims made about Microsoft. It was too big and powerful and was hampering innovation, and the only solution was to break it up.History shows there's a better, faster, more efficient and more direct way to deal with companies that are ""too big."" Let the free market work. Time and again, giants of industry get toppled not by government regulators, but by new disruptive competitors.Sears in its heyday, for example, was essentially a combination of Walmart (WMT) and Amazon. It had a massive retail presence, and a massive mail order catalog (the internet of the day) business. Today it is barely breathing.The government never did break Microsoft up. But new competitors like Google (GOOGL) and Apple (APPL) fundamentally reshaped the marketplace in ways that severely hampered it.Another way to look at it is this: Of the 500 companies that made the Fortune 500 list in 1955, only 53 remain on that list, notes economist Mark Perry.Only two of the companies that ranked in the top 10 in 1955 are still on the list. And of the top 10 companies today, four didn't even exist in 1955.It's a virtual certainty that decades from now, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and others will have gone the way of Microsoft or IBM or Sears or Zenith Electronics or Kodak or Bethlehem Steel.

The date for the close was not specified.Joseph Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, expects Softbank's investment to give General Motors both capital for commercializing autonomous vehicles and more flexibility on capital allocation, while unlocking share price value.""GM has a meaningful seat at the table for shared autonomous vehicles (""robotaxis"") and we believe this deal affirms that view,"" he wrote in a note.

652,CL,"Adidas (ADDYY) is under fire Thursday for not cutting ties with Yeezy creator Kanye West over his widely criticized comments earlier this week about slavery, just as the sportswear brand's first-quarter report suggests it's losing momentum in the key North America market.XWest, who has been designing his Yeezy brand footwear for Adidas since 2013, riled up the cybersphere Tuesday after alluding to entertainment news outlet TMZ that slavery might have been a ""choice.""""When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years?! That sounds like a choice,"" he said.Adidas tried to distance itself from his comments without cutting ties with the rapper himself.""Kanye has been, and is, a very important part of our strategy and has been a fantastic creator, and that's where I'm going to leave it,"" Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted told Bloomberg TV. ""I'm not going to comment on every comment that he or somebody else are making. That's pretty much the party line at this stage.""But Rorsted told analysts on the earnings call ""there are some remarks that we don't support,"" according to Reuters. Separately, he acknowledged West's optics contribution to Adidas' brand image while noting that the rapper has a limited sales impact on the No. 2 sports apparel and footwear player in the world.""While Kanye is a very important part of the Adidas brand, Adidas is a large global company that (has) a very, very strong presence around the world and will continue to perform well,"" Rorsted said. However, Kanye and Yeezy's significance to the company was ""less so"" from a revenue perspective.It's not clear how widespread the damage from West's comments could be, but at least one analyst sees potential harm for the Adidas brand.""Kanye West's recent controversial comments could create backlash among core Adidas consumers and toward the Yeezy brand in particular,"" wrote Cowen's John Kernan.Twitter is aflame with criticism of both Adidas and Kanye.

""In a performance-driven athleisure environment Adidas is less well positioned while Nike and Under Armour are best positioned.""Adidas said its online sales were its fastest-growing business, up 27%. Gross margin rose 1.5% despite being up against a ""significant currency headwind"" during the quarter.Reebok remains a weak spot, sliding 3% overall in Q1.Management reiterated its fiscal 2018 guidance for 10% currency-neutral sales growth, ""driven by double-digit growth in North America and Asia-Pacific,"" and 12%-16% gains in basic per-share earnings from continuing operations.Adidas sank 5.35% in the stock market today, to 117.37, closing below the 50-day moving average but above the prior 116.94 buy point.

677,CL,"Just as it stepped on the accelerator in the race to develop artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, Zenuity hit a traffic jam of sorts.XThe data-storage technology used by the joint venture to make autonomous vehicles couldn't pump out visual data fast enough to let its new Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processors work at anything approaching top speed.Enter Pure Storage (PSTG) and its FlashBlade technology. As one of 10 vendors brought in to clear the bottleneck, Pure Storage left the competition in the dust and a partnership was born, according to the website Next Platform.""The partnership with Nvidia started in the field, which I think is generally, at least in my experience, where the best partnerships begin,"" Pure Storage President David Hatfield said on a recent company earnings call.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePure Storage is still a relatively small player in a slow-growing industry. Yet it's competing in fast-growing areas and taking market share from legacy providers.Its relationship with Nvidia serves as a prime example. Joint marketing activities between Pure Storage and Nvidia have been ongoing for several quarters. The wins have been piling up, helping push Pure Storage to profitability in the latest quarter. Following its first product launch in 2012 and initial public offering in 2015, Pure Storage eclipsed $1 billion in annual revenue for fiscal 2018.On March 27, Pure Storage announced its AI-Ready Infrastructure, which combines its FlashBlade and Nvidia's DGX-1 high-performance workstation as a fully integrated hardware and software system. The aim is to enable scientists to jump-start their artificial intelligence initiatives ""in hours, not weeks or months.""Pure Storage and Nvidia share other traits. Both stocks broke out of consolidations into buy zones on May 7. Nvidia cleared a double-bottom base ahead of its earnings report. Pure Storage broke above a cup-with-handle pattern.Pure Storage shares climbed more than 2% Wednesday morning and were near 23.50. Nvidia was up 1% near 248.10.IBD'S TAKE: Pure Storage cleared a 21.43 buy point on Monday, May 7. A buy point is the point at which a stock has the greatest likelihood of further near-term gains, especially when the stock is a leader in a leading industry group. Pure Storage qualifies as the No. 3 stock, according to IBD Stock Checkup, in the Computer-Data Storage industry group that's ranked No. 7 of 197 groups based on price performance and momentum. Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a recent note to clients, initiating coverage on Pure Storage, that FlashBlade accounted for roughly $80 million, or 10%, of product sales in the past year.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski expects FlashBlade to emerge as Pure Storage's top revenue producer ""over the next 2-3 years, as more Big Data and Artificial Intelligence workloads are deployed.""In a recent note to clients, Nowinski said the unstructured data that dominates artificial intelligence historically is stored on disk-based, networked devices from the likes of NetApp (NTAP) and Dell Technologies (DVMT). He says they ""cannot meet the performance requirements of next-generation analytics.""Nowinski sees Pure Storage's system that relies on flash memory rather than spinning hard-disk drives, as ""uniquely positioned to capture market share in this segment.""FlashBlade's debut in the second half of 2016 opened a new market for Pure Storage. It also gave the company a full portfolio to serve the data-storage needs of enterprise customers.Supporting all of a customer's workloads has helped Pure Storage move upmarket. It sells to cloud-service providers and has gained more Fortune 500 customers looking to consolidate storage vendors used in their data centers, Nowinski says.About 50% of FlashBlade customers were already Pure Storage customers, he notes. The company said it signed up about 500 new customers in the latest quarter. That raised the total to more than 4,500 organizations.The company puts its total addressable market opportunity at $35 billion. Meanwhile, the market for external storage systems stands at $23 billion a year and dropped slightly in 2017, William Blair analyst Jason Ader said. He expects it to be flat over the next several years. Yet the areas that Pure Storage plays in grew 35% last year, he says.Tech research firm IDC expects all-flash arrays to comprise 44% of external storage sales by 2021. That's up from the current figure of 28%. Scribner thinks that projection could prove conservative.""Current infrastructures are based on old, slow, scale-out architectures which demand many data copies and silos, fragmenting the potential of data and increasing its cost and complexity,"" Pure Storage Chief Executive Charles Giancarlo said on a recent earnings call.Giancarlo came aboard as CEO last August, having previously served as chief technology officer at Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco is a key partner for Pure Storage and seen as a potential acquirer. Pure Storage markets its FlashArray and FlashBlade storage system with Cisco networking gear in an optimized package called FlashStack.Ader adds that roughly 30% of Pure's revenue in the latest quarter came from public cloud customers, such as software-as-a-service providers Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Management has noted that this vertical has been growing faster than the overall business and that it now has over 500 cloud customers to date,"" he wrote.But getting business from the big public cloud providers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is considered out of reach.Still, Pure Storage said last August that FlashStack was seeing triple-digit growth. It reported thousands of deployments in more than 30 countries.The company is widely credited as being the technology leader in its field. Industry research firm Gartner placed Pure Storage as being furthest along on its ""completeness of vision"" axis for solid state arrays.Ader says Pure Storage designed its software and systems architecture from the ground up to take advantage of flash media. In contrast, rivals for the most part designed their products for hard disk ""and only later retrofitted for flash.""The market appears to be recognizing that leadership as evidenced in customer win rates. Those are ""ticking up quarter-by-quarter,"" Giancarlo says. Further, Ader notes, Pure Storage was able to carve out 66.4% product gross margins in calendar 2017 vs. 50.2% for NetApp.With so much going for it, what could slow Pure Storage's momentum?""The biggest risk is the competition,"" Ader told Investor's Business Daily.Dell EMC has acknowledged its market-share struggles in storage and pledged to spend $2 billion to turn it around. Dell last week unveiled new storage products aimed at negating Pure Storage's technology lead.But Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wasn't impressed. He compared Dell's updated product line with that of what he considers the more up-to-date Pure Storage.His assessment: It ""did very little to narrow the gap.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Pure Storage, 58.com Are Breakouts; These 3 Top Stocks Are In Same Bullish PatternCloud Software Stock Splunk Breaks Out Of Base Ahead Of Quarterly ResultsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

679,CL,"On Thursday, Bio Rad Labs (BIO) earned an upgrade to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 66 to 81. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.This proprietary rating identifies technical performance by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an 80 or higher RS Rating as they launch their biggest price moves.See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksBio Rad Labs broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 279.69 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also keep in mind that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Earnings grew 72% last quarter, up from 0% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from 9% to 10%. Bio Rad Labs holds the No. 12 rank among its peers in the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group.

680,CL,"Retailing, apparel, consumer-spending and semiconductor-related stocks dominated the market's upside in stocks today, as major indexes sought to beef up their morning gains. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), meanwhile, reaffirmed a new trend of emerging institutional demand within the restaurant industry group.Chipotle, which is a new trading idea in IBD SwingTrader on Wednesday, rallied more than 3% to 440.27 in healthy turnover for what figures to be its fourth up day in a row.Chipotle's volume is running 52% above usual levels, hinting that mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are accumulating shares heavily.The stock ran in the short sellers on April 26 after reporting Q1 results that pointed to an ongoing turnaround in fundamentals. After that big jump, Chipotle traded tightly and volume dried up, forming a handle in the process. That positive action following the catapulting move in price in essence formed a handle and a 433.10 buy point within its new deep first-stage base.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite paced the key indexes with a gain of more than 0.7%. At 7405, the premier index of high-growth companies is now up 7.2% year to date. It advanced 28.2% last year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF rallied 1.2% to 35.25. The exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital, gained 34% in 2017.The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. A two-point drop by 3M (MMM) hampered the Dow Jones industrial average's advance. The blue chip index rose around 0.3%. Volume is running around 7%-8% lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use3M has been hit with heavy institutional selling ever since the Dow Jones industrial component and manufacturing giant cracked below the 50-day moving average in severe volume on Feb. 5, a key sell signal.Some sector indexes heated up even more.The PHLX Semiconductor index, also known as the SOX, winged 1.1% higher. Micron Technology (MU) broke out of a new double-bottom base at 54.37 in decent but not great turnover.Notice how in this nine-week double bottom, the middle peak of 54.27 is actually 10 cents beneath the midpoint of the actual base (45.31 low plus 63.42, giving a base midpoint of 54.37). You'd prefer to see the midpoint of a double bottom be firmly lodged within the upper half of the base.That said, Micron is still 11% below the base's 63.42 peak. In other words, it's possible for the stock to continue building the right side of the current base. Double-bottom bases can also form handles, which represent a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, and boost the chances of a successful breakout.Micron is a member of the strong data storage industry group. In that group, Smart Global (SGH) continues to act as a market leader as well. Shares, up nearly 4% to 47.33, are working on the right side of a potential cup pattern.Returning to the restaurant group, Wingstop (WING) and Shake Shack (SHAK) are showing robust action so far in 2018.The former has made a series of rebounds off the 50-day moving average after it cleared a 33.64 buy point in a 10-week flat base on Nov. 3, 2017. On that day, the chicken wing chain reported a 31% jump in earnings to 17 cents a share for the third quarter of 2017 as sales lifted 19% to $26 million.Since then, earnings have risen 13% and 19% in the prior two quarters. In IBD Stock Checkup, Wingstop ranks 5th within the Retail-Restaurants industry group with an 87 Composite Rating. That overall ranking belies a solid EPS Rating of 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the company's long- and short-term profit growth is superior to 88% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.Wingstop's Composite score is likely hurt by the fact that it doesn't have an SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating. Why? Wingstop does not have a calculable return on equity. As of the first quarter of 2018, the Dallas-based company showed a total stockholders' deficit of $146 million. Nonetheless, Wingstop posts excellent operating cash flow that has been higher than annual earnings per share for four years in a row.The Street sees Wingstop's earnings rising 14% to 83 cents a share this year and 19% to 99 cents in 2019.Shake Shack powered past a 44.50 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13, then blasted higher nearly two weeks later after the popular burger, crinkle cut fries, and shake chain posted a 50% bulge in adjusted Q1 profit and a 29% increase in sales to $99.1 million.Wingstop and Shake Shack are small cap firms with market values of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.3% to $71.08 a barrel. That decline didn't stop IBD 50 member Daqo New Energy (DQ) from rallying nearly 11% to 65.22 in hefty trade.The expert in making raw polysilicon for solar cell production is a wild stock, easily prone to swinging up or down 5% any given day. Nevertheless, the stock has now cleared a 65.09 entry point in a deep double bottom base and is in buy range.The 5% buy zone for Daqo goes up to 68.34.Daqo is No. 13 in the IBD 50.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is holding firmly above the 3% threshold, currently at 3.08%.Fed funds future now show a roughly 54% chance that the Federal Reserve will make four quarter-point hikes in short-term interest rates by December this year.RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point In Stocks: Maximize Your Return, Minimize Your RiskWhich Stocks Just Entered The IBD 50, Sector Leaders, And Other Key IBD Screens?

It also confirmed it has become the second-largest shareholder in Apple (AAPL).In an SEC filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31, the company said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts worth about $693 million. This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month.

In February, Teva said it was well on its way to realizing half those savings by year's end.One Buffett decision that hedge fund managers seem to agree with is his increased Apple holding.

However, keep in mind that the stock has a penchant for pulling back rapidly after hitting new highs.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved a 1% early-morning loss to nearly nil. Key Nasdaq component Apple (AAPL) erased minor morning losses and is trading near 188, up 5% past its latest 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double-bottom base.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also cut beefy early losses to around 0.2% to 0.3%.

As noted in the Market Pulse table within the Big Picture, the S&P 500 has logged seven distribution days within the past 25 sessions.

702,CL,"Goldilocks has left the building. For proof, just look at interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield eclipsed 3% in late April for the first time in four years, hitting the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Clearly, the not-too-hot/not- too-cold economy that supported the nine-year bull market for stocks has fundamentally changed. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield again hit 3%.To some extent, that's good: Higher interest rates largely reflect faster economic growth, unemployment headed to a multidecade low and wage gains that are slowly picking up.Yet financial markets are sending the message that this good news comes with a growing risk of a squeeze on the economy from several directions. First, higher goods and wage costs will squeeze corporate profits. Caterpillar (CAT) warned recently that the first quarter was the ""high-water mark"" for operating margins, and profit pressures already are hitting other companies ranging from airlines to packaged food. Second, higher interest rates will squeeze corporate and household borrowers. Rising rates also could squeeze stock prices as investors opt for higher returns from risk-free short-term government bonds.Yet by far the biggest risk is that policymakers will go overboard. Fed rate hikes to counteract a temporary growth spurt from new tax cuts and government spending could push the economy into a recession if they go too far.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the stock market, the most obvious sign of peril is the hit to the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average since late January. But worrisome signs lurk in the details. Both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 176 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled from their January high. Meanwhile, the Banks-Money Center group, which includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and more, has slid to No. 158.While the latest data point to a robust housing market, there's no mystery about why housing stocks have tumbled as the 10-year Treasury yield pushes up mortgage rates. But what about the recent underperformance vs. the S&P 500 from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? While higher interest rates have grabbed the headlines, the more ominous signal is the flattening Treasury yield curve. Over the past year, the gap between the 2-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield has been cut by more than half. The yield curve is at its flattest levels since the lead-up to the 2007 recession.Higher interest rates boost profits for Bank of America, Citigroup and others when the longer-term rates at which they lend increase more than the short-term rates at which they borrow. But the opposite has been happening, so even bank profits are getting squeezed. Two-year yields have climbed with the Fed's overnight rate and expectations of future hikes. But the 10-year yield's rise has lagged. Investors aren't demanding a big long-term premium, which suggests mild growth expectations beyond two years. The 2-year yield has hit its highest rates since August 2008, squeezing the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields.By the second half of 2019, an economy that the Fed worries is at risk of overheating could hit a soft patch as stimulus levels off. Overly tight Fed policy that raises borrowing costs could turn that soft patch into a ditch.Fed policymakers today are focused on overheating risks, while overlooking the likely slowdown. The Fed's latest projections, issued when the Fed hiked rates in March for the first time this year, penciled in two more rate hikes in 2018, three in 2019 and still two more in 2020. That would lift the Fed's benchmark rate from 1.62% now all the way to 3.375%. If that happens, the 10-year yield could head for 4% and the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage might near 6%.The bond market's reaction to the more hawkish Fed outlook was swift. Within a week, the spread between the 2- and 10-year Treasury yield narrowed to less than 50 basis points, then fell to as little as 40 basis points in mid-April. The spread is around 47 basis points in the stock market today, with the 2-year yield at 2.53% and the 10-year at 3%.Neel Kashkari, the dovish president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, called the flatter yield curve a ""yellow light flashing"" a heightened risk of a recession. His take-away: The Fed ""may not be that far away from neutral,"" a rate that neither boosts nor restrains economic growth.""We are clearly more concerned than the Fed"" about the economic outlook for 2019, wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank. ""As the impact of the (tax cut and spending) stimuli fades, growth rates should begin to slow perceptibly around the middle of the year, before slowing further into 2020.""Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment research at Sun Life Investment Management, told IBD that he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 3.5% within a year as the Fed follows a path of accelerated tightening. He predicts one rate hike per quarter through 2019, ""which ultimately will lead to recession"" in 2020.To be fair, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose deep into the expansion, when growth is firm and labor markets tight. To top it off, the deficit financing used to pay for stimulus, which will exacerbate what most economists see as an unsustainable fiscal path, has added to upward pressure on interest rates.Now the Fed's challenge just got even harder. Core consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.1% in March. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption price index, rose to 1.9% in March. That's just below the central bank's 2% target.Average hourly wage growth ticked up to 2.7% in March and will likely head higher in the next few months. CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) all announced pay hikes effective this spring. CVS raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour and Target to $12. They are among dozens of major companies that announced wage increases in the wake of corporate tax cuts passed in December.As core inflation edges past the Fed's target and the jobless rate falls below 4%, standing pat would go against policymakers' deepest instincts.Bandholz expects cooler heads to prevail, with the Fed hiking rates just once in 2019 as data point to a slowdown. But Mullarkey notes that the data ""feedback loop is not instantaneous."" By the time the Fed recognizes that a soft patch has arrived, a recession may be a fait accompli.Even if the Fed does shift gears a year from now, false expectations come at a cost today. If policymakers are determined to stick to a path of steady Fed rate hikes, they could dampen the dynamic impact of lower taxes by adding to the growing and unsustainable federal debt burden.The more future Fed rate hikes that markets price in, the more federal borrowing costs will rise. As the government borrows more to service debt with higher interest rates, borrowing costs for businesses and individuals will face more upward pressure.Deutsche Bank estimates that U.S. Treasury issuance will soar from $1 trillion in 2017 to $1.5 trillion this year and $2.3 trillion next. The surging federal deficit is the main culprit. The Fed will add to the debt pileup as it offloads about $180 billion in government bonds this fiscal year.The Fed set its plan last fall for quantitative tightening, reversing bond buys made to aid the tepid recovery from the financial crisis. Newly passed tax cuts and spending hikes make those balance sheet reductions look like ""bad timing,"" Mullarkey says.Corporations carry a record $8.8 trillion in debt that will be more costly to refinance, working at cross-purposes with the tax-cut stimulus.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have begun to push up the dollar. That acts to tighten financial conditions not only at home but in developing economies where companies often borrow in dollars.""The risk in all this is a scenario where economic growth doesn't pick up as the supply-siders expect it to but interest rates move higher as a result of the larger federal deficits and the perception that Trump's fiscal stimulus might boost inflation,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street economist who now runs Yardeni Research.That may not happen, but Yardeni sees little evidence that corporations are putting their tax windfalls to work in the real economy: ""We are waiting to see some signs that the supply-siders are on the right track. We aren't seeing any yet, though it has been only four months into the Trump tax cuts.""Stock market history suggests investors shouldn't worry right away about a flatter yield curve, LPL Financial strategists John Lynch and Ryan Detrick write. ""When looking back at the previous five recessions, once the yield curve hit 0.50%, it took a median of nearly a year before the curve inverted,"" they note.An inverted yield curve, meaning long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields, is a reliable predictor of recession. Yet recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the yield curve inverts.Also, Lynch and Detrick note, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a median 21.5% gain after the Treasury yield spread narrows to 50 basis points.The problem with counting on that history is that the Fed faces unusual late-cycle stimulus at a time that federal debt has begun an unprecedented spiral upward.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

707,CL,"Although communications software stock RingCentral (RNG) earned a place recently in the Stock Spotlight screen, there are five reasons to approach the stock with caution.First, the stock market itself isn't in the greatest shape. The uptrend has been under pressure. While a stock can be bought when the market is struggling, it's better if the market is in a confirmed uptrend.Second, the base RingCentral is working on is third stage. As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

708,CL,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereThird, take a look at RingCentral's monthly chart in MarketSmith. The stock has been a straight-up story for the past 16 months. Only two of the 16 months were down months.IBD research shows the average life span for a winning stock is 18 to 24 months. RingCentral isn't far from that range.Fourth, RingCentral is No. 4 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Given the size of the group (about three dozen stocks trading at 12 or higher), No. 4 is respectable.But is respectable what the investor should be looking for? Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch said if a business unit isn't No. 1 or No. 2 in its space, the company should unload it. IBD founder William O'Neil takes a similar approach to stocks. If a stock isn't No. 1 or No. 2 in its group, why bother?Fifth, RingCentral is missing some fundamental ingredients.Pretax margin was 3.3% last year. Return on equity was about 11%, which is below the 17% minimum associated with elite stocks.The EPS Rating is 78, largely because the stock was a money loser until 2016. (A rating of 78 means RingCentral is in the top 22%.)Also, analysts have cut their earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019. RingCentral, which makes phone systems for business, will report first-quarter earnings May 9 after the close. Analysts' consensus estimate is a profit of 12 cents a share, up 300%, and sales of $145.4 million, a 30% increase.The point here isn't to trash RingCentral's stock. After all, it's good enough to make the Stock Spotlight screen and the base is shaping well. The stock has risen 165% since a breakout in February 2017. It is up almost 40% so far this year.

709,CL,"Two top stocks with very different characteristics and companies are preparing to report results early Thursday. Abiomed (ABMD) reports its fiscal fourth quarter results. Floor & Decor (FND) turns in first-quarter numbers.One trait the two top stocks do share: both are listed on IBD's Stock Spotlight stock screen. Another important factor: analysts expect both to generate EPS growth greater than 60%, while sales growth is forecast to be above 30%.For Abiomed, its 60% EPS growth target would mark a sharp downshift after two quarters of triple-digit earnings gains. Its track record with topping estimates is uneven. In its fiscal first and second quarters, it beat analyst targets by 95% and 42%, respectively. In the third quarter, earnings were shy of expectations by 43%.The Danvers, Mass.-based company has a market capitalization of $13.6 billion, while generating revenue of $445 million in fiscal 2017. The consensus estimate is for a 31% revenue increase this year to $584 million, with earnings rising 85%.Abiomed produces small pumps that are inserted using a catheter through an artery in the leg and into the heart. Sold under the Impella name, they supplement and increase the pumping power of the heart. It markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In October, Abiomed announced its first Impella recipient in Japan. But the company reported that sales outside the U.S. accounted for less than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn terms of stock action, shares Tuesday were up 63% since the start of the year. In addition, the stock was in a buy range above a 304.38 buy point in a flat base. The base is very late stage. That means the current breakout comes with a high risk of failure. The good news: The stock only needs to pullback about 11% in order to undercut the current base pattern and reset its base count.Among top stocks, Floor & Decor is considered a smaller midcap, with a market capitalization of $5.3 billion. It generated revenue of $1.39 billion in 2017. The company distributes wood and tile flooring through a network of 83 warehouse-type locations scattered over 21 states. Competitor Lumber Liquidator's (LL) stores are relatively small, and tucked into mini-mall-type locations. By contrast, Floor & Decor stores average around 73,000 square feet. Home Depot (HD) stores, for comparison's sake, average about 105,000 square feet.Analyst consensus places the Smyrna, Ga., company's first quarter EPS growth at 64%, with a 30% advance in revenue. The first quarter is seasonally a strong period for the company, and the consensus estimate is below last year's first-quarter gain of 75%.The revenue forecast is just below Floor & Decor's average sales gain of 30% over the past three quarters. The company has topped analyst expectations over the past four quarters by margins of anywhere from 5% to 30%. For the year, analysts see EPS rising 39% on a 25% sales gain.Floor & Decor is a young stock, public only since April 2017. Unlike Abiomed's tight-trading shares, the IPO swings wide and loose on a regular basis. It was up only 11% for the year Tuesday, but trading 163% above its year-ago IPO price.Shares are currently extended, 7% above a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup base.

McDonald's (MCD) rose 5.75% on a strong Q1 report but the benefits didn't spread marketwide.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is set to begin a two-day meeting Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average reversed to a 0.6% loss, after being up almost 0.8% earlier. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.8% each, after wiping out earlier gains.Volume in the stock market today fell across the board.A step down in volume was perhaps natural, considering the Fed's meeting later this week.CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds of a rate increase at about 7%. The probability of no change is pegged at almost 93%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe major indexes have been encountering resistance at their 50-day moving averages over the past six to seven sessions. If the stock market is to shake off the negative pressure, retaking the 50-day line is an important first step.Among market watchers, the recent worry is the narrowing of the spread between the 10-year yield vs. the 2-year yield. But the problem with using the yield curve for market guidance is that ""recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the curve inverts,"" as IBD Weekly's cover story ""The Big Squeeze"" pointed out.And not every economist agrees that yields should be the top focus right now. Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke argues that the broad money supply as measured by Divisia M4 is a better guide to the economy. So far this year, Divisia M4 grew 4.8% in January, and 5% each in February and March.Hanke calls that kind of growth ""not bad"" and points to an economy where ""everything is running pretty smoothly.""Then why is the stock market struggling? It's much more useful to focus on what's happening than to search for causation. Individual investors should closely follow the charts for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.What are they showing? The choppiness that began in early February is still in place.On Monday. leaders advancing included Mastercard (MA), up 1.3%, and retailer Canada Goose (GOOS), up 1.4%.Mastercard will report Q1 results Wednesday before the market's open.Several items stand ready to break for either good or bad.First, banks are now expected to win at least a partial battle against some Dodd-Frank regulations. The Hill reported that Congress is near passage of a bipartisan package.Second, a decision on steel tariffs is near. Temporary exemptions for the European Union are about to expire. President Trump reportedly hasn't made a decision. Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to leave for China soon for trade talks.Third, IBD's industry group lineup has taken definition. Going into Monday's session, only 10 sectors are outperforming the Nasdaq. New leaders could emerge from the outperforming sectors.The 10 sectors are software, up 13% year to date; consumer, up 8.2%; medical, up 6.9%; leisure, 6.3%; business services, up 6%; retail, up 5.8%; savings and loan, up 5.5%; apparel, up 4.6%; energy, 4.2%; and banks, 4%.Fourth, Trump implied that he can save the market. Speaking in Michigan recently, Trump admitted he is doing something that ""bothers the market."" He said the stock market ""would've been up 60%, but I have to do things. I can't let other countries take advantage of us, so we're doing trade deals.""The implication is that the market will recover once Trump finishes doing things that bother the market.McDonald's rose almost 6%, hoisting the stock over its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines after a strong quarterly report. Earnings increased 22% vs. the year-ago quarter.The Street expected earnings growth of 14%. Q1 revenue dropped 9%, but analysts expected a 12% decline.McDonald's is basing in a 18%-deep consolidation. The stock is 7% under a high marked in late January.The Federal Reserve's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday isn't expected to create big waves. The Street expects the Fed to stand pat on rates for now. An increase now would be a shock.RELATED:Defense Matters When Swing Trading In A Choppy Market5 Retail Or Apparel Stocks That Investors Should TrackThe Stock Indicator That Is Like A Canary In The Coal Mine

736,CL,"If a major company needs capital or a private firm wants to sell, Warren Buffett's checkbook is often the one they seek out. Will that stay the case when it's someone else's signature?XThat was the question from several Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders at the firm's annual meeting Saturday, adding a fresh angle to the topic of succession for the 87-year-old chairman. Berkshire's desire to utilize a cash pile that has grown to more than $100 billion makes finding large-scale deals a key issue for whoever will be the conglomerate's next leader.Buffett downplayed any unique skill he has to drum up deals, using his inability to find recent ones as evidence. Berkshire often makes large investments in times of panic, when its stable capital, and not the Buffett name, is the allure, he argued.""The reputation belongs to Berkshire now,"" Buffett said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. ""We are the first call and will continue to be the first call.""Charlie Munger, Buffett's 94-year-old vice chairman, said already most acquisitions are coming from the chiefs of the company's operating subsidiaries, not he and Buffett.""It's happening more there than it is at headquarters,"" he said.Although Buffett named two vice chairs this year in a step toward succession, he didn't directly address the race for his heir at the meeting.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOverall, the meeting had a similar feel to recent years. Buffett and Munger traded one-liners and fielded a few tough questions. But, by and large, the two managed to charm their fans again and keep most of them in their seats for the entire six-hour session. Here were some other topics of interest.Investors got some detail on the performance of the two men Buffett has handed some of his stock-picking duties. The billionaire said the deputies have both ""slightly"" beat the S&P 500 Index since they started managing Berkshire's money.Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who together oversee about $25 billion, have almost identical performance since they joined, Buffett said. Combs was hired by Berkshire in late 2010 and Weschler joined about a year later. While Buffett said their performance roughly amounts to matching the S&P 500, they've received some incentive pay that they only get if they outperform that benchmark.""It's been better than I've done, so naturally I can't criticize,"" he said.Buffett tried to temper high hopes for the healthcare venture he's pursuing with Amazon (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) While he said they should name a chief executive officer in the next couple months and other companies have expressed interest in joining, Buffett acknowledged the many obstacles it faces.""We will see what happens,"" he said. Buffett and Munger were definitive in their disdain for cryptocurrencies in answer to a question at the meeting. Buffett said they will likely come to a bad ending because their value depends on someone wanting to buy them for even more money.They draw in a lot of ""charlatans"" and people of ""less than stellar character,"" Buffett said.Munger was even more forceful in his aversion to the assets.""It's just disgusting,"" he said. It's like ""somebody else is trading turds and you decide 'I can't be left out.'""The pair were confident that trade tensions between the world's two largest economies wouldn't escalate into something that derails progress. And they were bullish on the prospects for China.Buffett suggested he should do a deal in China this year because of the luck of the number eight there -- and his turning age 88 in August. American investors are missing out on opportunities in China, said Munger who has previously encouraged Buffett to invest there.""It just looks like it's too hard sitting in Omaha to outsmart the Chinese market,"" Munger said. But it's where people should be looking, he said.The meeting also ignited some sparring between Berkshire leaders and Elon Musk, the head of electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), over the theory of moats around businesses.""Elon says a conventional moat is quaint, and that's true of a puddle of water,"" Munger said referring to Musk's comments on an earnings call earlier in the week. ""It's ridiculous. Warren does not intend to build an actual moat. Even though they're quaint.""While Buffett said it does seem like more moats have become susceptible to invasion recently, he still observes plenty of companies, such as Berkshire's See's Candies unit, where they're holding firm.""Elon may turn things upside down in some areas, I don't think he'd want to take us on in candy,"" Buffett quipped. ""There are some pretty good moats around.""Musk fired back at his fellow billionaires on Twitter Saturday.""I'm starting a candy company & it's going to be amazing,"" Musk tweeted. ""I am super super serious.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Warren Buffett: 'We're Not Doing Anything' On General Electric StockApple Stock Hits Buy Point On Berkshire Hathaway's Increased StakeBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

739,CL,"Although communications software stock RingCentral (RNG) earned a place recently in the Stock Spotlight screen, there are five reasons to approach the stock with caution.First, the stock market itself isn't in the greatest shape. The uptrend has been under pressure. While a stock can be bought when the market is struggling, it's better if the market is in a confirmed uptrend.Second, the base RingCentral is working on is third stage. As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29
"
740,CL,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereThird, take a look at RingCentral's monthly chart in MarketSmith. The stock has been a straight-up story for the past 16 months. Only two of the 16 months were down months.IBD research shows the average life span for a winning stock is 18 to 24 months. RingCentral isn't far from that range.Fourth, RingCentral is No. 4 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Given the size of the group (about three dozen stocks trading at 12 or higher), No. 4 is respectable.But is respectable what the investor should be looking for? Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch said if a business unit isn't No. 1 or No. 2 in its space, the company should unload it. IBD founder William O'Neil takes a similar approach to stocks. If a stock isn't No. 1 or No. 2 in its group, why bother?Fifth, RingCentral is missing some fundamental ingredients.Pretax margin was 3.3% last year. Return on equity was about 11%, which is below the 17% minimum associated with elite stocks.The EPS Rating is 78, largely because the stock was a money loser until 2016. (A rating of 78 means RingCentral is in the top 22%.)Also, analysts have cut their earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019. RingCentral, which makes phone systems for business, will report first-quarter earnings May 9 after the close. Analysts' consensus estimate is a profit of 12 cents a share, up 300%, and sales of $145.4 million, a 30% increase.The point here isn't to trash RingCentral's stock. After all, it's good enough to make the Stock Spotlight screen and the base is shaping well. The stock has risen 165% since a breakout in February 2017. It is up almost 40% so far this year. But investors might be better off taking profits.

743,CL,"Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday reported ""another great quarter"" for its Apple Watch smartwatch.

By contrast, the company discloses unit sales for iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.So, for the past 12 quarters, Wall Street analysts have had to estimate Apple Watch sales by parsing data from Apple's ""other products"" line item and other sources.

749,CL,"Nike's (NKE) corporate culture was reportedly such that male executives could pursue sexual relationships — sometime extramarital — with subordinates without fear of repercussion, while women did not escape unscathed, according to a report Wednesday.XFormer employees at the world's biggest athletic apparel brand told Bloomberg that women in such relationships experienced negative consequences, like being reassigned, while the men largely avoided punishment.Nearly a dozen Nike execs, including one woman, have stepped down over the last two months amid surfacing allegations of workplace misbehavior and a ""boy's club"" atmosphere. The names of another five managers came to light Tuesday: Steve Lesnard, Tommy Kain, Helen Kim, Simon Pestridge and Ibrahem Hasan.Women were subject to derogatory nicknames by one supervisor, said a Bloomberg source.

751,CL,"Dow Jones futures rallied Wednesday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as crude oil prices rebounded solidly a day after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield moved back above 3%.Despite concerns about the stock market and geopolitical impact, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed virtually unchanged Tuesday after Trump's Iran decision. Most top stocks in buy range continued to act well, with Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) nudging higher.Crude oil prices fell, but pared losses and held near multiyear highs Tuesday.Dow Jones futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.45%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.35% higher.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseU.S. crude futures rose 2.7% to $70.95 a barrel, hitting their best levels since late 2014.The 10-year Treasury yield just topped 3%, hitting 3.006%, after peaking at 3.02% in late April. Meanwhile, the 2-year yield climbed to 2.52%, putting the spread at a still-narrow 48 basis points. That 3% yield, and the narrowing Treasury yield spread with the 2-year rate, pressured stock markets.Tuesday's stock market action held three key investing lessons. 1. Don't be swayed by outside noise and punditry; focus on the action of the major stock market averages and leading stocks. 2. The 50-day moving average looms large for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. 3. Pay close attention to the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line is an easy way to separate true stock market winners from laggards.Investors should stay in tune with important business, political, economic and technology news and trends. That can inform your investing decisions. But your primary focus and investing guide should be the action of the major indexes — the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average — and the action of leading stocks.President Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal drew a lot of attention, and deservedly so. But ultimately, the collective wisdom of investors decided for now that Trump's decision to exit that accord was not a market-moving event. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite just inched higher in stock market trading Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index edged lower.Meanwhile, most recent breakouts fared well. Tech giants Apple and Nvidia rose fractionally, outperforming the broader market. Top oil stocks like Marathon Oil (MRO) acted bullishly, paring intraday losses or even gaining despite a modest loss for crude futures.The 50-day is often a key area of support for leading stocks as well as the major indexes. But it can also act as resistance. Since late January, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have struggled to move above the 50-day line, with the few attempts short-lived. Both indexes are just below the 50-day currently, though futures Wednesday suggest they may make another run at that level.The Nasdaq composite reclaimed that level on Friday and is holding just above that line.Investors should always focus on the true stock market leaders. If you're going to take on stock-specific risk, you want to get outperformance. But in conditions like now, when the stock market uptrend is under pressure, besting the S&P 500 simply is a must.Apple, Nvidia, Mastercard and Visa all rose fractionally, moving higher but still within their 5% buy zones. While the price gains were modest, the RS lines all hit long-term or all-time highs. Marathon Oil fell intraday to 19.15 before roaring back for a 3.4% gain at 20.44, extended from an 18.76 buy point.

752,CL,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

753,CL,"U.S. stock futures turned narrowly positive early Friday, as the Dow looked to extend its six-session win streak and the S&P 500 tacked toward its best week in almost three months.A busy after-hours earnings reporting session on Thursday saw Nvidia (NVDA), Trade Desk (TTD) and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) among the names in motion after hours.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average shook off earlier losses and edged 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures managed even tighter gains.The Dow clocked out on Thursday with its sixth straight advance, lifting the index 2% for the week through Thursday and putting it on track for its first weekly advance in three weeks. The S&P 500 is ahead 2.2%, also eyeing its first weekly jump in three weeks and, so far, its strongest week since early March.The Nasdaq rose 2.7% for the week through Thursday, looking toward its third gain in four weeks. Summed up, the market is on track to exit the week in a lot better shape than when it entered it.IBD 50 name Nvidia slipped nearly 3% in Friday's premarket trade, despite crushing fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations in its report after Thursday's close. Second-quarter revenue guidance was also above views. The company gave no EPS guidance for Q2. At the close of regular trading, the stock was in a buy range above a flat-base buy point at 254.60. The chart also can be interpreted as a double-bottom base with a 239.35 entry.Trade Desk spiked 22% ahead of the open. The Ventura, Calif.-based online advertising platform saw both earnings and revenue growth accelerate in its first quarter. The company's 89% EPS growth and a 61% revenue surge easily topped analyst targets. Management's raised Q2 and full-year revenue and earnings guidance were well above consensus hurdles.Trade Desk shares ended Thursday up nearly 7% for the week, and still struggling to retake their converged 10- and 40-week moving averages. Thursday's extended trading move implied a breakaway gap on Friday, past a 61.03 buy point in a gnarled-looking cup base. It's best to read up on buying breakaway gaps before trying to jump in. And keep in mind that not all premarket moves carry over into regular trade.Among stocks that appeared headed for Friday's injured list, security software developer Symantec (SYMC) collapsed 19% after tripping over weak guidance. DNA screening pioneer Intrexon (XON) fell 7% as losses widened. And Yelp (YELP) dropped more than 4% after analysts gave its first-quarter report mixed reviews.Friday offers up a comparatively light earnings schedule, as well as a very sparse day of economic releases. Import-export price data are due from the Labor Department before the market opens. The University of Michigan delivers its preliminary reading on May consumer sentiment at 10 a.m. ET.Crude oil prices were flat early Friday. Crude gained 0.3% Thursday, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate settling at $71.36 a barrel, up 2.4% so far for the week.

Tencent (TCEHY), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two (TTWO) are all seen as potential winners.""(The) ruling should pave the way for more widespread access to betting on professional esports, which is a clear positive for traditional sports betting sites, many of which have recently begun to offer esports betting,"" Sandler said in a research note.""This news is also a net positive for video game publishers Tencent (Riot Games) and Activision (Blizzard), which operate several of the most-watched esports globally, as well as Take-Two, which recently launched an esport in partnership with the NBA.""While video game companies are perhaps not the most obvious beneficiaries from the ruling, the analyst expects them to get material gains in a variety of ways.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""As we think about how material greater access to esports betting could be in the next several years, we feel the direct financial benefit for video game publishers and esports leagues will manifest in the form of higher broadcast and/or sponsorship revenues as awareness, viewership and interest in esports draws greater investment in the space,"" Sandler said.Meanwhile, social media giant Facebook is likely to rack up cash, both from increased advertising and a potential return to using the website as a gateway to gambling.""Facebook actually was in the online casino space in 2012 with a third-party developer called Gamesys (that) launched Bingo Friendzy using cash for the first time instead of the popular virtual-goods purchases in other gaming apps like Farmville,"" Sandler said. ""This trial didn't really get very far, but structurally everything is in place for users and developers to leverage Facebook as a gaming and sharing channel when online betting goes live.""The figures that could be funneled into online advertising are substantial, with Barclay's estimating the opportunity to be worth around $3 billion. However, it stressed there is precedent for the sums being even higher.""However, if the same situation that happened in 2015 plays out whereby DraftKings and FanDuel spent 180% of revenue on customer acquisition (the scorched-earth land-grab phase), this figure could easily top $10 (billion) in digital ad (spending),"" Sandler said.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen believes media companies could also be in line to benefit from legal sports gambling, ""including sports team and rights owners,"" such as Liberty Media (BATRA) and Madison Square Garden (MSG).However, there will also be wider benefits, with the likes of ESPN parent Disney and MSG Networks, which will cash in ""from increased advertising on live sports content.""""Online gaming companies typically spend 20%-30% of sales on marketing in order to consolidate share, and so TV networks and sports leagues could be beneficiaries,"" Allen said in a research note.Sports betting is not out of the woods yet, as Congress could step in, according to Cowen analysts.But the firm pointed out that opponents to gambling lack the votes needed to enact a ban. In addition, states are eager to tap into the potential tax revenue, which the firm says could be as much as $3.4 billion per year.And there is wide support at the state level, with sports gambling bills existing in some form in roughly half the 50 states.Shares of Facebook closed down 1.2% on the stock market today, Tencent dropped 3.8%, Activision lost 2.1%, Take-Two dipped 0.8%, while MSG rallied 2.2% and Disney edged up 0.5%.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: Supreme Court Legalizes Sports Betting; These Gaming Stocks Are The Big Winners NBA Backs Nationwide Sports Betting — For This Price Online Poker Giant Makes Sports Betting Gamble With $4.7 Billion DealWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

755,CL,"While President Trump's apparent China trade-war detente grabbed all the headlines on Monday, Treasury yields and Fed rate-hike odds quietly continued their recent surge.That may explain why stocks, which rallied early after Trump's Sunday tweet called for a rescue of Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, had trouble staying positive. The S&P 500 briefly turned negative before the blue-chip index clawed out a 0.1% gain. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite also settled with slim advances.The two-year Treasury yield, which hit a new post-financial-crisis high of nearly 2.55% on Monday, has kept marching higher despite some market-friendly economic data. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.0%, a level first breached in late April.Two data points this month had seemed to set Wall Street up for a monthlong reprieve from Fed rate-hike worries. First, average hourly wages grew a disappointing 2.6% vs. a year ago in April. Then core consumer price inflation unexpectedly held steady at 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePerhaps even more important, the Federal Reserve began to send a more forceful message that it won't overreact when inflation creeps above its 2% target, as most expect it will.Nevertheless, odds of a fourth rate hike this year climbed to 51%, up from less than 40% a month ago, according to the CME Group FedWatch page.The message from the bond market is that there will be no reprieve about Fed concerns anytime soon. One possible contributor to the steadily rising market rates is spiraling federal borrowing needs, even as the Federal Reserve reverses some of its financial-crisis-era bond purchases in a move dubbed quantitative tightening.The bond market is sending a second message: Even if the Fed doesn't overreact to inflation data, its current rate-hike trajectory may be too aggressive. And some economists think the Fed's current rate-hike intentions already are. The Fed is pulling away monetary stimulus amid a surge in fiscal stimulus this year. But as federal stimulus starts to wane, the economy is due for a letdown in the second half of 2019.The expectation of strong growth now and a soft patch around the corner explains the narrow gap between the 10-year Treasury and two-year Treasury yields of about 45 basis points.The flat yield curve is bad for banks' net interest margins, since banks borrow at long-term rates and lend at short-term rates.  That's why both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 182 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled 25% from their January high.

757,CL,"In 2016, Veeva Systems (VEEV) didn't join Leaderboard until weeks after the stock reached a buy point. It still turned out to be a smart move — a lesson that buying is not always limited to the day of a breakout.The health-care software company rose past a 28.05 buy point mid-May 2016. It certainly was not a stellar breakout. Price and volume limped higher when they should have been powerful (1).On the weekly chart, the move looked better in terms of price and volume. The relative strength line made new highs, another plus for the breakout. By May 27, there was no doubt the breakout was working. Shares shot up 8% in heavy trading thanks to a 25% rise in EPS and an even larger increase in sales of 33%.Still, Leaderboard editors waited on Veeva. The stock at this stage had run too far from its buy area. But another opportunity arose in mid-June, when the stock consolidated gently (2). Volume trended lower as the stock eased, and was much lighter than when shares were rising.That's a bullish price-volume combination on any chart, and a sign that institutional investors did not sell heavily during the dip. The stock had not touched its 50-day moving average, where leading stocks normally find their support. Still, Leaderboard editors decided the pullback was attractive and it was time to add the stock on June 20 (3).From a longer-range perspective, the stock was still near the 33.10 prior high in a 14-month pattern.Twelve weeks passed with little trouble. Shares behaved well even while the Nasdaq tumbled nearly 7% on June 24-27. Veeva shares shot up Aug. 31 on a strong earnings report. Yet the stock stalled after that, even if it wasn't making any topping signals.We removed Veeva from the Leaders list on Sept. 9 (4), as shares reached a 44% increase from the 28.05 buy point and a 17% gain from its arrival on Leaderboard. At its prior high, Leaderboard's gain was 20%, which is enough to justify taking profits.Veeva spent 11 weeks forming a base. It broke out Nov. 23 but gave up all gains from the breakout to start on another base.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

761,CL,"With supersize stores, each carrying tens of thousands of unique home furnishings and décor products, At Home (HOME) has developed a strategy that's delivered consistent double-digit revenue growth.XIts 150 stores across 34 states average more than 100,000 square feet in size and carry about 50,000 unique products. Contending it's the leading retailer in its category, At Home believes it dedicates more space per store to this product category than any other company in the industry. It operates in the large, growing and fragmented home furnishings and décor industry, which on the aggregate rings up about $193 billion in total annual sales.At Home's product offerings include furniture, rugs, bath and bedding goods. It also has products for kitchens and dining rooms, mirrors, clocks, artwork and items for patio and garden. The retailer says it has developed a loyal band of enthusiastic and diverse customers who are passionate about decorating their homes.""They're running a very efficient retail business, making investments in the right space and not overbuilding,"" said Greg Portell, partner at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. ""That runs counter to what often happens in retail, when companies overbuild and lose sight of what they do.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe company made a substantial investment in building inventory in 2016, to maintain a steadier flow of products. It says it also began moving products through its distribution centers faster and more efficiently than ever.""We believe that our broad and comprehensive offering and compelling value proposition combine to create a leading destination for home décor with the opportunity to continue taking market share in a large, fragmented and growing market,"" the company says on its website.More than 70% of At Home's merchandise is unbranded, private label or specifically designed for the chain. It's also geared toward every budget. At Home believes its home décor concept, operating model and flexible real estate strategy create competitive advantages. And analysts say shoppers flock to the stores looking for what they perceive as bargains.""They found a way to successfully elevate treasure hunting,"" said Portell.At Home has delivered consistent double-digit sales growth. For its fiscal fourth-quarter ended Jan. 27, At Home reported revenue of $294 million, up 25% from the year-ago quarter.It was driven by record first-year performance from new stores and a 5.7% increase in comparable store sales. That was its 15th consecutive quarter of over 20% sales growth and its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales increases.""Our full-year results underscore the consistent, disciplined, highly profitable growth delivered by our management team over the last five years,"" At Home Chief Executive Lewis Bird said. Bird made the remarks in prepared comments when the company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 22.During fiscal 2018, which ended in January, At Home increased store count by 21%. It also delivered 24% net sales growth, and grew same-store sales by 6.5%.The company opened 26 new stores in fiscal 2018 and plans another 31 in fiscal 2019. It expects annual store growth of about 15% to 20% for the foreseeable future.At Home believes it has the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the U.S.""At Home stands out in the home furnishing space with high unit growth, healthy same-store sales and strong new store productivity, reflecting improved merchandising and brand awareness, as well as better inventory management,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a recent note to clients. He has a price target on the company of 35.Shares were up 1.3% near 35.80 on the stock market today.At Home was founded in 1979 with the store name of Garden Ridge and remains headquartered in Plano, Texas. The company was acquired in 2011 for $715 million by AEA Investors, in a leveraged buyout.In June 2014 the company changed its name to At Home. It spent $20 million to convert its then-70 stores to a new format and name. Then it held an initial public offering in August 2016, pricing shares at 15.Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler has a neutral rating on At Home and price target of 36.""At Home continues to generate one of the more dependable growth stories in hardlines retail,"" Fassler wrote in a note to clients. ""At Home delivered another top-line beat, and has established a consistent cadence of growth in merchandise, sales and delivery and same-store sales growth for the past number of quarters.""A lot of retailers only dabble in the home décor and furnishing space, including Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Target (TGT), said Portell. At Home is all in, he said, as they stick to just home furnishings and décor.At Home is different from the likes of Walmart, Costco and Target in that it does not sell products online. It believes that, for the category of goods it sells, consumers prefer an in-store shopping experience. That's where they can touch, feel and take what they want home that day.Compare that with one of its closest competitors, Wayfair (W), which sells products only through its online platform.Wayfair announced its first-quarter results on May 2.

762,CL,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

Buffett disclosed the share purchases on CNBC late Thursday.Apple stock topped the 179.04 buy point of a double-bottom base Friday morning in heavy volume, leaping 4%. That puts the stock in buy range. Already the largest stock with a market capitalization of more than $930 billion, Apple is making a bid to become the first company with a market cap of $1 trillion.The Buffett news capped a bullish week for Apple, which gapped up Wednesday after earnings and sales for the March-ended quarter beat expectations. The company guided sales higher for the current quarter and announced a dividend increase plus a new $100 billion share buyback.Some companies that fell on earnings pared losses or even reversed higher, a sign of the broad buying on Wall Street today.Arista Networks (ANET), a stock in the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders, plunged after earnings beat estimates but the company's outlook was soft. Arista reduced its loss to 8.5%. Arista's current base has an oscillating shape, not the smooth price contours that characterize the best bases.Alibaba (BABA) reversed higher after the Chinese internet giant's earnings beat expectations and it forecast full-year revenue growth of 60%, well above views. The stock is still forming a double-bottom base with a 201.60 buy point, and it climbed back above the 50-day line.The restaurant industry group has been rising rapidly, and on Friday Shake Shack (SHAK) soared to the highest share price since August 2015.

The provider of software for rental property management posted adjusted earnings of 37 cents a share, above views. Revenue of $201.3 million in Q1 was a 32% increase vs. a year ago.Energy stocks are bubbling up, and on Friday Cheniere Energy (LNG) broke out of a cup-without-handle base.

766,CL,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will hold its annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, an event likely to draw thousands seeking financial enlightenment from Warren Buffett, the conglomerate's billionaire CEO and Wall Street's quintessential grandfather figure.Here's a look at what to expect from the meeting that has been called the Woodstock of Capitalism.Buffett, in his 2017 shareholder letter, said ""America's economic soil remains fertile."" While President Trump has cut corporate taxes, he's also threatened to start a trade war with China. Markets also are worried about inflation and Fed rate hikes. Those developments could color whatever sweeping declarations Buffett might make about the nation's economy.In September, a JPMorgan analyst wrote that Buffett, 87, ""shows no signs of slowing and could possibly be at the helm for another decade."" But in January, Buffett appointed two insiders — Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain — to Berkshire Hathaway's board. He said they are ""key figures"" that ""both have Berkshire in their blood."" Wall Street will be listening for additional details.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBuffett owns a ton of shares in Apple (AAPL) and Wells Fargo (WFC). He could offer more detail about why he's loaded up on the iPhone maker. He could also discuss the struggling Wells Fargo, which the Federal Reserve has barred from growing until the bank cleans itself up after several scandals surrounding its sales practices.Meanwhile, RBC analyst Deane Dray sees General Electric (GE) as ""an ideal Warren Buffett investment."" Buffett bailed on GE stock last August. But Dray noted that earlier this year Buffett told CNBC that he would buy the industrial giant ""at the right price."" Buffett has rescued other big, ailing legacy businesses in the past.Then there's the $100 billion in capital that Berkshire is sitting on. Investors, almost certainly, will be hoping to get a sense of whether Buffett might use it to buy a company, or more Apple stock, or put it toward a dividend.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, in his own annual shareholder letter, offered some early but very broad details of the bank's health care collaboration with Berkshire and Amazon (AMZN). If Dimon can do it, maybe Buffett will too.The companies in January said they would partner on ""ways to address health care for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs,"" and create an ""independent company that is free from profit-making incentives.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Warren Buffett-Backed Oil Refiner Phillips 66 Earnings Top ViewsBerkshire Hathaway Shows Rising Relative Price Performance; Still Shy Of Key ThresholdBlockchain Health Alliance Follows Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan PactWill Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett Buy Up GE Stock?

As an investor, you need to set aside your preconceptions and be ready to adapt to changes in the market direction and individual stocks. Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AAXN) have all gone through good times and bad.Apple is now a leading stock, but just a few weeks ago it had been lagging the S&P 500 index for months. Alibaba and Facebook had long slumps soon after their IPOs before big runs. Boeing moved sideways for years before suddenly becoming the biggest Dow Jones gainer in 2017. (Alibaba, Facebook and Boeing are once again in a state of flux.) Much-smaller Axon Enterprise went through a years-long slump before doubling in the last few months.As for the the major stock market averages, the S&P 500 index rose for 14 out of 15 months before stock market volatility returned. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones struggled to move and hold above their 50-day moving averages since early February, but they did so last week.Bottom line, if you want to make a dime in the stock market, you have to be ready to change on a dime.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGo back to April 27. Apple's stock had fallen through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages amid growing signs of flagging iPhone demand. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was falling. The RS line had peaked in early November and hadn't made progress over the past year — or the past five.At this point, investors had every reason to be wary of Apple.But then Apple went on a nine-day, 17% winning streak, which only ended Friday with a 0.8% dip. Early in that run, Apple reported better-than-expect profit and announced a $100 billion stock buyback. A few days later, Warren Buffett announced that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) had bought another 75 million shares of Apple in the first quarter, bringing its total stake to nearly 5%. That sent Apple stock blasting through a double-bottom base and to a new high on May 4. Its RS line also set a record high.Apple stock edged higher in early stock market trading today.IPO shot up at the open of its May 2012 debut, but closed near session lows and just above its 38 IPO price. Facebook then slumped for months, hitting 18.03 in August. Remember, back then it was unclear if Facebook would successfully transition to mobile in terms of users and especially ad revenue. The stock looked like an overhyped IPO bust, much like Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP) has since its 2017 debut.Facebook didn't break out of a base until July 2013. It didn't set a new high until September 2013.Since then Facebook has been on a huge run, back by mammoth earnings and revenue growth.More recently, the RS line trended lower since November. Facebook crashed in late March over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Shares have rebounded since then. But after retaking its 50-day and 200-day lines on April 26, the stock has risen in low volume.On Friday, Facebook stock rose 0.8% to 186.99. Technically, Facebook cleared an odd-shaped double-bottom base, but the weak volume and price gain raises concerns.Low-volume breakouts can work, but a strong gain in heavy trade would be encouraging.Facebook shares rose a fraction in the premarket.Alibaba came public at 68 in its September 2014 debut, but jumped to an intraday peak of 99.70. The fast-growing Chinese e-commerce giant pulled back for a few weeks, then rallied and cleared an IPO base with a 99.80 entry. The stock ran up to to 120 by November 2014. Great stock, right?But shares actually reversed sharply lower on that November 2014 record day. By year-end, Alibaba was below its 50-day line. The stock kept falling until September 2015, when it finally bottomed at 57.20, more than 50% below its all-time high and undercutting its IPO price. Terrible stock, right?The top Chinese stock then underwent a long consolidation. Shares finally broke out in August 2016. That worked for a while, but shares then nearly roundtripped the buy point. Shares set up and broke out again in February 2017, triggering months of outperformance vs. the S&P 500.More recently, Alibaba has moved sideways. Much like Apple, its RS line has been flattish for months, trending vaguely lower since November peak. But since April 25, the stock has trended upward, approaching a double-bottom entry. Unlike Apple, it has not broken out and its RS line is not at highs.Shares rose slightly Monday morning.Investors should keep an open eye and open mind about Alibaba.Boeing moved sideways from late 2013 to late 2016. Its RS line trended slightly lower. Dead money?As it turns out, the Dow Jones aerospace giant was finally ready for takeoff.Boeing shares broke in October 2016 in its heaviest daily and weekly volume in eight months, on better-than-expected earnings. The RS line was at consolidation highs. Boeing also broke out of flat bases in January 2017, again in the spring and once more in late summer. Boeing went on to be the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Shares kept rallying and outperforming through February.The stock pulled back, falling below its 50-day two weeks later. Boeing has largely traded below that level since then, though it reclaimed that support last week. It's working on a new consolidation. Its RS line is off highs, but not radically so.Boeing edged up in the premarket.Axon Enterprise, formerly Taser, ran up from 2012 to June 2015. The stock then sold off until January 2016. It  rallied somewhat, but then moved sideways into early 2018.Once known for its Taser guns, the renamed company is focusing on body-worn cameras and data storage of that footage.Axon briefly cleared a long cup-with-handle in mid-February, pulled back to its 50-day, but entry still valid.Then Axon reported blowout earnings, sending the stock skyrocketing 28% on Feb. 28. Well above the buy zone, the breakway gap offered a buying opportunity. The stock has kept rising and hasn't formed a new entry point. Axon blasted 22% higher on Wednesday following her latest earnings, then rose into the end of the week.Axon stock was little changed early Monday.In less than 3 months, Axon stock has more than doubled.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tweets Lifts Stock Futures; Good News For These Techs?Time To Buy These 5 Hot Payment Stocks?Splunk Leads This Trio, All In Buy Ranges: Tests Chart-Reading SkillsBreakout Watch: No. 1-Ranked Software Stock Salesforce Enters Buy ZoneThese 4 Top Stocks Attempt Breakouts, But All Have FlawsThis Medical Stock And New Issue Is In Buy Range After Break

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseU.S. crude futures rose 2.7% to $70.95 a barrel, hitting their best levels since late 2014.The 10-year Treasury yield just topped 3%, hitting 3.006%, after peaking at 3.02% in late April. Meanwhile, the 2-year yield climbed to 2.52%, putting the spread at a still-narrow 48 basis points. That 3% yield, and the narrowing Treasury yield spread with the 2-year rate, pressured stock markets.Tuesday's stock market action held three key investing lessons. 1. Don't be swayed by outside noise and punditry; focus on the action of the major stock market averages and leading stocks. 2. The 50-day moving average looms large for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. 3. Pay close attention to the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line is an easy way to separate true stock market winners from laggards.Investors should stay in tune with important business, political, economic and technology news and trends. That can inform your investing decisions. But your primary focus and investing guide should be the action of the major indexes — the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average — and the action of leading stocks.President Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal drew a lot of attention, and deservedly so. But ultimately, the collective wisdom of investors decided for now that Trump's decision to exit that accord was not a market-moving event. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite just inched higher in stock market trading Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index edged lower.Meanwhile, most recent breakouts fared well. Tech giants Apple and Nvidia rose fractionally, outperforming the broader market. Top oil stocks like Marathon Oil (MRO) acted bullishly, paring intraday losses or even gaining despite a modest loss for crude futures.The 50-day is often a key area of support for leading stocks as well as the major indexes. But it can also act as resistance. Since late January, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have struggled to move above the 50-day line, with the few attempts short-lived. Both indexes are just below the 50-day currently, though futures Wednesday suggest they may make another run at that level.The Nasdaq composite reclaimed that level on Friday and is holding just above that line.Investors should always focus on the true stock market leaders. If you're going to take on stock-specific risk, you want to get outperformance. But in conditions like now, when the stock market uptrend is under pressure, besting the S&P 500 simply is a must.Apple, Nvidia, Mastercard and Visa all rose fractionally, moving higher but still within their 5% buy zones. While the price gains were modest, the RS lines all hit long-term or all-time highs. Marathon Oil fell intraday to 19.15 before roaring back for a 3.4% gain at 20.44, extended from an 18.76 buy point. The RS line set a 15-month best.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Indexes Resilient After Trump DecisionThe Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurvePure Storage, 58.com Are Buys; These 3 Top Stocks Are Setting Up In Same Bullish PatternTrump Scraps Iran Nuclear Deal, But With This CaveatThree Internets, Hot Oil Stock Report Earnings Wednesday; This One Is Near A BuyThese Four Leading Stocks Broke Out Past Buy Points Tuesday

779,CL,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

780,CL,"The time has never been better to be in the TV industry or to watch television. But you may want to enjoy it while it lasts.Insiders are calling this the era of ""peak TV."" This year, an estimated 520 scripted series will be produced for broadcast, cable and over-the-top internet services in the U.S., according to cable network FX. That's up 7% from 2017 and nearly 50% from just five years ago.The explosion of programming reflects competition touched off by the rise of over-the-top internet television, led by Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Hulu and a host of others.Yet TV industry watchers say it's only a matter of time before the market heads toward the backside of that peak. Millions of consumers have quit traditional pay-TV services, emboldened by fast-growing streaming TV services to become cord-cutters.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHow many internet video networks like Netflix will consumers support in the long run? That's an open question.""Without a doubt, it's a transition time in the television industry,"" TVAnswerman.com Publisher Phillip Swann said.While many in the TV industry fear a shakeout, the programming boom continues for now. But eventually the industry will split into winners and losers as consumers comb through their multitude of choices and bundle their programming.Most at risk are companies in the multichannel pay-TV business such as AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA). Some studios might abandon their own streaming TV services and return to supplying content for the remaining services. These players include the likes of CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIA) (VIA.B) and Walt Disney (DIS).The content onslaught started when Netflix, Amazon and others started providing direct-to-consumer video services, with catalog and original material. Hollywood studios rushed their own internet video networks into service for ""fear of missing out"" on the next big thing, Swann says. All the while, those same studios have supported legacy cable channels.Content production in the TV industry and consumption still are rising. In the U.S. last year, the average household paid for 2.04 streaming video services, according to Strategy Analytics. That's up from 1.79 the prior year.Netflix has the most viewers, followed by Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. Parks Associate analyst Brett Sappington counts more than 200 over-the-top video services in the U.S. alone. More than a third of U.S. broadband internet households subscribe to at least two over-the-top plans, he said. Some 15% subscribe to three or more.Major streaming services are expected soon from Disney and Apple (AAPL), crowding the field even more. Industry analysts wonder just how big the appetite is for these offerings.""That's the $64 billion question,"" Strategy Analytics analyst Michael Goodman said.Meanwhile, penetration of multichannel pay-TV services among households with broadband has fallen below 80%, a seven-year low, says Sappington.The average household spent $106 a month on pay-TV service last year, up 3% from 2016, according to Leichtman Research Group. That's a bit more than the 2% inflation rate.Now, in addition to regular cable, satellite and telco TV bundles, consumers can choose ""skinny bundles"" with limited channels like Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now. And they can mix and match subscription video-on-demand services.""Traditional pay-TV is very much in decline,"" nScreenMedia analyst Colin Dixon said.When the dust settles on the transition, consumers likely will pay for two or three ""anchor tenants,"" such as a skinny bundle and Netflix, Dixon says. Plus, they'll have a revolving roster of premium on-demand services that they'll get for limited periods. They'll supplement those services with emerging ad-supported, video-on-demand services such as Roku's (ROKU) Roku Channel, he says.""When it's all said and done, the average Joe will have probably three to four services that they pay for, pretty much month in and month out,"" Dixon said. ""But there will be a whole bunch of other stuff that they will take on when there's something interesting that they want to see, but drop again later. There also will be a whole bunch of advertising-supported services. We're just beginning to see that start now for more casual viewing.""Only a few subscription video-on-demand services with broad appeal are likely to be long-term winners in the new TV industry structure, analysts say. To succeed, they'll need a large selection of programming to keep consumers engaged and subscribing.Netflix is the service that others are chasing in the internet video market. It has been ""smart and strategically savvy"" in developing its service, TVAnswerman's Swann says.Amazon Prime Video is the tortoise to the hare that is Netflix, hoping that slow and steady wins the race, he says. Amazon's TV service has the benefit of being bundled as an extra with its Prime e-commerce service, which provides free, two-day shipping on millions of products.Beyond those two, and possibly Hulu, the outlook is less certain for subscription video-on-demand services.Consider CBS All Access. The CBS-owned service debuted with limited original content and offers mostly a library of sitcom and TV drama reruns. Its subscriber count spiked to more than 2 million after it launched ""Star Trek: Discovery,"" a new weekly series in the popular science-fiction franchise, last September.But when the 15-episode first season ended in February, many fans took to social media to announce they were quitting the service until the second season begins airing sometime in 2019.With internet video services, it is easy for someone to sign up, binge-watch a particular show, and then cancel the service and move on to another.""That's definitely going to be a challenge for these services,"" said Strategy Analytics' Goodman. ""Because the ease of getting in and out of them is there.""Subscriber churn is going to be a problem for many in the TV business, Parks' Sappington says.""With services priced on a monthly basis for the same or less than the cost of a movie ticket, then for a consumer to get in and out of service in a single month shouldn't be that big of a surprise,"" Sappington said.And with the current heightened promotional environment, consumers can bounce from one free trial to the next, Swann says.Besides the mainstream video-on-demand services, a host of smaller, niche services for passionate fans are likely to succeed. This second tier of internet video services now includes such channels as Crunchyroll for Japanese anime, World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) WWE Network and Gaia (GAIA) for yoga, fitness and spirituality programming.""You could go from January through December and watch a lot of great content and not pay a dime, if you're so inclined, just on free trials,"" Swann said.RELATED:Apple Services Called 'Next Paradigm Shift' For Company's StockRoku Stock Rises On Ad-Supported Streaming VideoNetflix Original Programming Fuels Subscriber Gains: Survey

781,CL,"U.S. stock futures turned narrowly positive early Friday, as the Dow looked to extend its six-session win streak and the S&P 500 tacked toward its best week in almost three months.A busy after-hours earnings reporting session on Thursday saw Nvidia (NVDA), Trade Desk (TTD) and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) among the names in motion after hours.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average shook off earlier losses and edged 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures managed even tighter gains.The Dow clocked out on Thursday with its sixth straight advance, lifting the index 2% for the week through Thursday and putting it on track for its first weekly advance in three weeks. The S&P 500 is ahead 2.2%, also eyeing its first weekly jump in three weeks and, so far, its strongest week since early March.The Nasdaq rose 2.7% for the week through Thursday, looking toward its third gain in four weeks. Summed up, the market is on track to exit the week in a lot better shape than when it entered it.IBD 50 name Nvidia slipped nearly 3% in Friday's premarket trade, despite crushing fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations in its report after Thursday's close. Second-quarter revenue guidance was also above views. The company gave no EPS guidance for Q2. At the close of regular trading, the stock was in a buy range above a flat-base buy point at 254.60. The chart also can be interpreted as a double-bottom base with a 239.35 entry.Trade Desk spiked 22% ahead of the open. The Ventura, Calif.-based online advertising platform saw both earnings and revenue growth accelerate in its first quarter. The company's 89% EPS growth and a 61% revenue surge easily topped analyst targets. Management's raised Q2 and full-year revenue and earnings guidance were well above consensus hurdles.Trade Desk shares ended Thursday up nearly 7% for the week, and still struggling to retake their converged 10- and 40-week moving averages. Thursday's extended trading move implied a breakaway gap on Friday, past a 61.03 buy point in a gnarled-looking cup base. It's best to read up on buying breakaway gaps before trying to jump in. And keep in mind that not all premarket moves carry over into regular trade.Among stocks that appeared headed for Friday's injured list, security software developer Symantec (SYMC) collapsed 19% after tripping over weak guidance. DNA screening pioneer Intrexon (XON) fell 7% as losses widened. And Yelp (YELP) dropped more than 4% after analysts gave its first-quarter report mixed reviews.Friday offers up a comparatively light earnings schedule, as well as a very sparse day of economic releases. Import-export price data are due from the Labor Department before the market opens.

Tencent (TCEHY), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two (TTWO) are all seen as potential winners.""(The) ruling should pave the way for more widespread access to betting on professional esports, which is a clear positive for traditional sports betting sites, many of which have recently begun to offer esports betting,"" Sandler said in a research note.""This news is also a net positive for video game publishers Tencent (Riot Games) and Activision (Blizzard), which operate several of the most-watched esports globally, as well as Take-Two, which recently launched an esport in partnership with the NBA.""While video game companies are perhaps not the most obvious beneficiaries from the ruling, the analyst expects them to get material gains in a variety of ways.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""As we think about how material greater access to esports betting could be in the next several years, we feel the direct financial benefit for video game publishers and esports leagues will manifest in the form of higher broadcast and/or sponsorship revenues as awareness, viewership and interest in esports draws greater investment in the space,"" Sandler said.Meanwhile, social media giant Facebook is likely to rack up cash, both from increased advertising and a potential return to using the website as a gateway to gambling.""Facebook actually was in the online casino space in 2012 with a third-party developer called Gamesys (that) launched Bingo Friendzy using cash for the first time instead of the popular virtual-goods purchases in other gaming apps like Farmville,"" Sandler said. ""This trial didn't really get very far, but structurally everything is in place for users and developers to leverage Facebook as a gaming and sharing channel when online betting goes live.""The figures that could be funneled into online advertising are substantial, with Barclay's estimating the opportunity to be worth around $3 billion. However, it stressed there is precedent for the sums being even higher.""However, if the same situation that happened in 2015 plays out whereby DraftKings and FanDuel spent 180% of revenue on customer acquisition (the scorched-earth land-grab phase), this figure could easily top $10 (billion) in digital ad (spending),"" Sandler said.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen believes media companies could also be in line to benefit from legal sports gambling, ""including sports team and rights owners,"" such as Liberty Media (BATRA) and Madison Square Garden (MSG).However, there will also be wider benefits, with the likes of ESPN parent Disney and MSG Networks, which will cash in ""from increased advertising on live sports content.""""Online gaming companies typically spend 20%-30% of sales on marketing in order to consolidate share, and so TV networks and sports leagues could be beneficiaries,"" Allen said in a research note.Sports betting is not out of the woods yet, as Congress could step in, according to Cowen analysts.But the firm pointed out that opponents to gambling lack the votes needed to enact a ban. In addition, states are eager to tap into the potential tax revenue, which the firm says could be as much as $3.4 billion per year.And there is wide support at the state level, with sports gambling bills existing in some form in roughly half the 50 states.Shares of Facebook closed down 1.2% on the stock market today, Tencent dropped 3.8%, Activision lost 2.1%, Take-Two dipped 0.8%, while MSG rallied 2.2% and Disney edged up 0.5%.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: Supreme Court Legalizes Sports Betting; These Gaming Stocks Are The Big Winners NBA Backs Nationwide Sports Betting — For This Price Online Poker Giant Makes Sports Betting Gamble With $4.7 Billion DealWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

786,CL,"Whether or not Walt Disney's (DIS) acquisition of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets goes through, Disney CEO Bob Iger assured investors late Tuesday that the ESPN+ streaming service and the upcoming stand-alone Disney pay-TV platform would not be dependent on the deal.But without Fox, Hulu — jointly owned by Disney, Comcast (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal, Time Warner (TWX) and Fox (for now, until Disney's acquisition of its entertainment assets is complete) — will be deprived of some content as Disney looks to pump the streaming service with more original programming.Iger nodded to that goal on the call, telling analysts that ""much"" of Hulu's future original programming would come from both Disney and Fox. The merger of assets would bring Fox shows such as ""The Simpsons"" and ""Empire,"" to name a few, not to mention the entirety of FX Networks and National Geographic Channels under Disney's wing.Those remarks follow Hulu's update last week that it now has 20 million subscribers. That's still less than half of what Netflix (NFLX) claims stateside, but a formidable figure as the streaming platform stakes out its own turf in the entertainment arena and tries to build revenue streams in ways that its ad-less rival cannot.Hulu also inked a multiyear deal with DreamWorks Animation, stealing away the kids content creator from Netflix. Netflix said in December that it would release half a dozen original DreamWorks Animation Television series on the service in 2018.But Hulu's announcement last week means that it, too, will soon have DreamWorks content, and exclusive content at that. The platform and studio are teaming up to develop original kids and family series based on current DreamWorks franchises and movies, to be released in 2020. Starting next year, Hulu will be the only place where American viewers can watch DreamWorks movies such as ""How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" and ""Trolls 2"" online.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The dystopian series, which became the first streaming show to win the Emmy for best drama, last week began its second season. Hulu claimed the season-two premiere doubled viewership vs. the first season.While Netflix has shied away from featuring ads, Hulu plans to debut ""ad-supported downloadable content,"" in which advertisers can insert their commercials into shows and movies that users have downloaded on their devices. The company is also going to start offering ad space in its live-TV subscription service.Netflix shares edged up 0.2% to 326.89 in the  stock market today.

The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder.

Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan.

GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus.

805,CL,"The major indexes enjoyed a slow yet steady afternoon rebound but still closed mildly lower on Thursday. Some commodity stocks and cyclical plays paced the upside, including ship transport, logistics, coal and homebuilding. Preliminary volume figures were mixed as traders fret over how the U.S. and China will handle two-day talks on trade.Inside the IBD 50, small-cap energy play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gapped up at the open. At one point the energy play rallied to an all-time high of 26.93, briefly surpassing a 26.53 buy point within a nearly nine-week cup without handle.Meanwhile, as Apple (AAPL) tiptoed closer to a potential new breakout, an emerging group of new leaders powered past their own buy points and sharply outperformed the market. They included Marathon Oil (MRO) (up 6% in double average volume) and Tableau Software (DATA) (up nearly 7% in more than four times usual turnover).The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a tiny gain of 5 points as it notched a positive reversal. Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages. But some fast-growing banks, such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and SVB Financial (SIVB), have been holding up much more firmly.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on leading stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside The Big Picture?

If the test goes well, Marriott will expand its home-sharing offerings to other cities, leveraging its loyalty program and expertise in branding to stand out in a crowded field, Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson said on an earnings call Wednesday.""As some of these platforms have grown into millions and millions of units, there is almost a paralyzing array of choices and a lack of branding,"" Sorenson said.

833,CL,"A breakaway gap is the quintessential breakout and a crucial part of stock analysis.XTypically event-driven, such as a strong earnings report, these price gaps can send a stock catapulting out of a good base. Why do they occur? Buying demand surpasses the available supply of shares to be sold so much that the stock has to rise high enough in price to convince holders to sell their shares and match the heavy demand.By the close of trading on a gap-up day, it's not unusual to see a leadership-quality stock rise at least 20%. Volume tends to surge well above average. It leaves you with no doubt that this stock is going higher, much higher.Let's take a look at LinkedIn back in 2013.

Large earnings and sales gains confirmed that thesis.On Jan. 10, 2013, LinkedIn broke out of a classic 16-week cup-with-handle base with a 117.42 buy point. The base's positives included six consecutive up weeks on the right side of the base and a three-weeks-tight pattern within the handle. In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales were up a whopping 267% and 81%, respectively, vs. a year ago.On the breakout day, the stock staged a small price gap up and rose almost 4%. Volume increased 54% above its 50-day average. With an earnings release several weeks away, the stock meandered in and out of the 5% buy range until it launched 21% higher on Feb. 8 (1). Volume surged more than 600% above average as institutions flooded into the stock.There is a direct correlation between power and distance; the more power at the start, the higher the stock can go. From the close of trading on its Feb. 8 breakaway gap, it ran up another 34% before the stock formed a new cup base. Even at all-time highs, the stock had plenty of upside potential.If a stock gaps up so hard that it doesn't trade within 5% of the proper buy point, you may go ahead and buy shares as close as possible to the opening price. But make sure it has the fundamentals to be a true market leader. It should be No. 1 in its industry group, and the market should be in a young, new confirmed uptrend. The Big Picture column gives you a sense of the market's current stage.Since we're in earnings season, it is even more important to keep an eye on leading stocks and their earnings announcement dates. MarketSmith, an Investors.com premium charting and stock screening product, provides lists that look for new breakaway gaps, such as the one made by Planet Fitness (PLNT) in November 2017.Once again, an earnings surprise paved the way for this stock's big breakout. With a huge gap up out of a flat base on Nov. 8, the stock surged past its 27.32 entry in volume more than seven times greater than average. That same day, the stock quickly became extended, but traded in the 5% buy range early in the morning. (The above chart is a weekly chart; please see a historical daily chart at MarketSmith to see the actual breakout.)Unless you're 'Johnny-on-the-spot,' you missed it.Planet Fitness quickly rallied 28% to a high of 35.03 by late December, enabling holders to lock in gains based on IBD's top offense-type sell rule before the stock's next basing process.That's why having access to MarketSmith and its 'Breakaway Gap' list, and other IBD lists, such as IBD 50 and Big Cap 20, can be so instrumental to successful stock research.(A version of this column was originally published on Feb. 3, 2017, at Investors.com.)RELATED:Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsHow To Find The Correct Buy Point: Read This Investor's CornerStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhy Winning Stocks Are Already Strong Price Performers Before They Make Big Price MovesStock Analysis: 3 Elements That Can Reveal Much About A Company

Still, the industry leader's slip threatened the week's strong performance among chipmakers.Friday's early loss dragged the stock back below a flat-base buy point at 254.60.

840,CL,"Facebook (FB), MSCI (MSCI), HubSpot (HUBS) and Pegasystems (PEGA) all attempted stock market breakouts Friday, but each has flaws that may give investors pause for thought. The social media monster rose 0.8% to 186.99 in Friday's stock market trading, nudging past a double-bottom base with a buy point of 186.20. Facebook is now back above where it was on March 16, just before the Cambridge Analytica scandal battered its share price.But there are reasons to be wary. Friday's move came on volume that was well below normal. You want to see breakouts occur in volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal, with the higher the better. Heavy volume on breakouts points to mutual funds and other big institutions loading up on shares. Low-volume breakouts can work, it's just that the odds are less favorable. It also doesn't help that Facebook's rally in the last few weeks has come in tepid trading activity.Facebook's stock price also is just nudging past the buy point.

Unaesthetic bases are more prone to failure.On the positive side the stock is now well clear of both its 50 and 200-day lines, while its relative strength line is at its highest level in three months. The RS line is still below its consolidation high, but at least it's above where it was when the stock was forming the middle of its W-shaped pattern.And as a leading stock, Facebook boasts top class fundamentals, with a 99 EPS Rating. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99.The company previously known as Morgan Stanley Capital International broke out from a far more aesthetically pleasing cup base without a handle with a correct entry of 160.08.But, like Facebook, MSCI's ""breakout"" was a low-volume affair, with the stock just crossing the entry, closing up 0.7% at 160.95. The RS line also is not quite at new highs.The provider of market indexes and equity portfolio analysis tools has been consistently beating views on both revenue and earnings, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97.The inbound marketing and sales software developer cleared a double-bottom base entry point of 117.70 intraday Friday following its strong adjusted earnings and revenue. But the stock, which hit 120.65 intraday, reversed in heavy volume to close down 2.55% at 114.65.HubSpot's Composite Rating is a strong 93.In the last 15 trading sessions, it has sold off on above average volume on six occasions, compared to just one day of above average buying.The business solutions software company made a move even though it missed earnings views Thursday. It came in six cents light at 16 cents per share, a year-over-year drop of 71%. However it beat on revenue, which increased 5% to $235 million.Pegasystems rose 2.9% to 65.05, clearing resistance around the 64 area. The stock closed in the midpoint of its range, which is only OK. Volume was heavy.While it boasts a decent IBD Composite Rating of 89, a clear red light is the EPS Rating of just 54.

883,CL,"Comcast (CMCSA) made its $31 billion, all-cash offer for satellite TV broadcaster Sky official on Wednesday, but any notion that a bigger deal for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) is on the horizon may have been put to bed by a company executive.Judging from Comcast's stock movement Wednesday, investors seem to think comments by the cable TV giant's chief financial officer indicate that all the company wants at this point is Sky. Shares were up 4% earlier in the day and ended the regular session 2.7% higher to 34.26.The reason: While Comcast has structured the Sky bid as all cash, it would need to tap equity to bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Further, it would have to outbid Walt Disney (DIS), which in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.When asked about Comcast's view of equity and debt to finance other possible acquisitions, CFO Michael Cavanagh said on the company's earnings call Wednesday: ""I don't see us using stock at these levels, period.""Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

884,CL,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start Here""While circumstances can always change, I think it is unlikely that we would use Comcast shares as a medium of exchange for a transaction,"" Cavanagh added later on the earnings call.Fox has made a competing bid for Sky and had been its only official suitor until Comcast confirmed it wanted the U.K.-based company on Wednesday. Comcast in February announced its intention to bid for Sky, sending shares of the cable TV firm down. Comcast has dropped nearly 15% this year.When Comcast targeted Sky, that spurred speculation that they would follow up by bidding for all of Fox, thus sparking a bidding war vs. Disney. Comcast may not be ready, at least for now, to bid for Fox using its equity at depressed levels.""People are taking that (Cavanagh's comments) to mean they won't pursue Fox any further,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.""But that may not be the right reading,"" added Moffett. ""Sky makes a lot more sense with a studio acquisition than without one. Without using equity, Sky and Fox together would mean roughly $100 billion of debt. That's a staggeringly large number, so an all-cash offer is unlikely. But, mathematically, it isn't inconceivable.""An independent committee of the Sky board on Wednesday withdrew their recommendation to accept the Fox offer and terminated the cooperation agreement. Analysts expect Fox to increase its offer for Sky, possibly with Disney's help.Fox owns 39% of Sky and has offered to buy the rest of the company. A U.K. regulator in January advised that the government to block the Fox bid because of media ownership concentration. But regulators could be open to Disney or Comcast owning Sky, even though they're foreign companies.Comcast said adjusted first-quarter earnings were 62 cents a share, up 17% from a year ago, with revenue rising 11% to $22.79 billion, topping consensus estimates. Analysts expected Comcast to report earnings of 59 cents on sales of $22.74 billion for the period ended March 30.Comcast said it lost 96,000 video subscribers in the March quarter vs. 42,000 a year earlier.

889,CL,"The stock market faces several key tests in the coming week. Can the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reclaim key support. Can Apple (AAPL) stock hold its 200-day? How will chip stocks respond? Will the 10-year Treasury yield top 3%? And is Twitter (TWTR) now a better stock than Facebook (FB) or Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)?The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Friday. Apple stock, the top weighting in all three gauges, tumbled to just above its 200-day line. Several chip warnings set the stage for the stock market and Apple struggles; now Intel (INTC) leads several other big chip names with earnings this week. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a four-year high of 2.96%, as inflation and Fed rate hike fears mount up.Those stock market tests are interrelated to a large extent. But there's also a big question. After struggling for years as a company and stock, Twitter has been roaring back over the past 12 months and in 2018 while FANG stocks Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet have lost momentum.The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, and the major averages did close higher for the week. But the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite came under pressure just as stock breakouts were picking up steam. The 50-day line usually is an important level, but it's loomed especially large over the last several weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSince tumbling through its 50-day line on Feb. 5, the S&P 500 has only closed above that level 13 times.

The Nasdaq was above its 50-day for the most part from mid-February to March 21, but since then it's had just 3 days over that line.The S&P 500 and other major averages rose slightly on the stock market today.After tumbling 2.8% on Thursday, the iPhone maker fell 4.1% on Friday, crashing through its 50-day moving average and closing just above its 200-day line. No question, Apple stock was a major reason for Friday's stock market sell-off.Apple did trade below its 200-day line for a few days in early February as the brief stock market correction bottomed. But aside from that unusual market environment, Apple stock has not traded below its 200-day line since July 2016.Technically, Apple is in a flat base. But its  relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at its lowest levels since mid-February. The RS line hasn't made headway in almost a year.Apple rose a fraction Monday morning.Chip stocks set the stage for Friday's sell-off in the major averages and Apple with gloomy outlooks from a trio of major semiconductor players: Chip-gear makers ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) and contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Taiwan Semi, which makes chips for Apple and many others, cited weak smartphone demand.The iShares Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) ETF dipped below its 50-day on Wednesday, then tumbled Thursday and Friday. The Philly Sox SOXX ETF rose slightly early Monday.While the stock market can rally without chips participating, it's not easy. Chips are a major part of the stock market. And chips are in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3. So if semiconductors are struggling, that's a bad sign for several other big stock market sectors.Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), MKS Instruments (MKSI) are among the key chip names on tap this week.The 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply last week, especially Wednesday-Friday, closing at a four-year high of 2.96% and contributing to Friday's stock market slide. With oil prices at their highest levels since late 2014 and wage pressures bubbling, inflation and Fed rate hike concerns are growing.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.99% and then pared gains to 2.97%.A year ago, this would have been a laughable question. At most, investors might debate whether Twitter or Snap was a better Facebook also-ran.Over the past 12 months, Snap has tumbled 28%. Facebook has climbed 16% and Google-parent Alphabet 25%. Twitter stock has more than doubled, surging 118%. In 2018, Twitter has rallied 33%, while Facebook is down 6% while Google and Snap are up 2% and 4%, respectively.Snap was massively overhyped for its March 2017 IPO. Facebook, struggling with user growth and time on site, is struggling with a data privacy scandal as well as Russian interference. Those Facebook woes have spilled over to Google, while both are facing growing headaches in Europe over competition and privacy concerns.Twitter has gained momentum.

901,CL,"The stock market faces several key tests in the coming week. Can the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reclaim key support. Can Apple (AAPL) stock hold its 200-day? How will chip stocks respond? Will the 10-year Treasury yield top 3%? And is Twitter (TWTR) now a better stock than Facebook (FB) or Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)?The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Friday. Apple stock, the top weighting in all three gauges, tumbled to just above its 200-day line. Several chip warnings set the stage for the stock market and Apple struggles; now Intel (INTC) leads several other big chip names with earnings this week. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a four-year high of 2.96%, as inflation and Fed rate hike fears mount up.Those stock market tests are interrelated to a large extent. But there's also a big question. After struggling for years as a company and stock, Twitter has been roaring back over the past 12 months and in 2018 while FANG stocks Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet have lost momentum.The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, and the major averages did close higher for the week. But the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite came under pressure just as stock breakouts were picking up steam. The 50-day line usually is an important level, but it's loomed especially large over the last several weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSince tumbling through its 50-day line on Feb. 5, the S&P 500 has only closed above that level 13 times. The Dow Jones has only been ended above the 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 5. The Nasdaq was above its 50-day for the most part from mid-February to March 21, but since then it's had just 3 days over that line.The S&P 500 and other major averages rose slightly on the stock market today.After tumbling 2.8% on Thursday, the iPhone maker fell 4.1% on Friday, crashing through its 50-day moving average and closing just above its 200-day line. No question, Apple stock was a major reason for Friday's stock market sell-off.Apple did trade below its 200-day line for a few days in early February as the brief stock market correction bottomed. But aside from that unusual market environment, Apple stock has not traded below its 200-day line since July 2016.Technically, Apple is in a flat base. But its  relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at its lowest levels since mid-February. The RS line hasn't made headway in almost a year.Apple rose a fraction Monday morning.Chip stocks set the stage for Friday's sell-off in the major averages and Apple with gloomy outlooks from a trio of major semiconductor players: Chip-gear makers ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) and contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Taiwan Semi, which makes chips for Apple and many others, cited weak smartphone demand.The iShares Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) ETF dipped below its 50-day on Wednesday, then tumbled Thursday and Friday. The Philly Sox SOXX ETF rose slightly early Monday.While the stock market can rally without chips participating, it's not easy. Chips are a major part of the stock market. And chips are in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3. So if semiconductors are struggling, that's a bad sign for several other big stock market sectors.Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), MKS Instruments (MKSI) are among the key chip names on tap this week.The 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply last week, especially Wednesday-Friday, closing at a four-year high of 2.96% and contributing to Friday's stock market slide. With oil prices at their highest levels since late 2014 and wage pressures bubbling, inflation and Fed rate hike concerns are growing.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.99% and then pared gains to 2.97%.A year ago, this would have been a laughable question. At most, investors might debate whether Twitter or Snap was a better Facebook also-ran.Over the past 12 months, Snap has tumbled 28%. Facebook has climbed 16% and Google-parent Alphabet 25%. Twitter stock has more than doubled, surging 118%. In 2018, Twitter has rallied 33%, while Facebook is down 6% while Google and Snap are up 2% and 4%, respectively.Snap was massively overhyped for its March 2017 IPO. Facebook, struggling with user growth and time on site, is struggling with a data privacy scandal as well as Russian interference. Those Facebook woes have spilled over to Google, while both are facing growing headaches in Europe over competition and privacy concerns.Twitter has gained momentum. In the fourth quarter it crushed adjusted earnings views and reported its first-ever GAAP profit. Always popular with reporters, policy experts and newshounds, Twitter is building on its news niche with more video even as Facebook de-emphasizes news.Alphabet reports earnings late Monday, followed by Twitter early Wednesday and Facebook that evening.Twitter is consolidating just above its 50-day line, but does not yet have a proper base or buy point. Alphabet is working on a double-bottom base, just below its 50-day. Facebook has been moving higher, but is below its 50-day and 200-day lines.Alphabet and Facebook were just above break-even Monday morning, while Twitter rose a fraction.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Signal More Losses; These Big Earnings Are On TapNot Just Apple: The Other Big Reason For Friday's Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet Lead Tech Earnings Bonanza: Investing Action Plan

The company is upbeat about the current quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon also said it would raise the annual cost of its Prime membership program by 20% to $119, from $99. Amazon recently disclosed that it has more than 100 million Prime members, who get free two-day shipping and many other benefits.The stock leapt 7.1% to 1,626 before the open on the stock market today. That would be a new high and push Amazon above a 1,617.64 buy point from a cup base. Amazon at first glance has a handle, which would offer a lower entry. But a cup-with-handle base must be seven weeks long, and Amazon has not quite consolidated long enough.Keep in mind that Amazon is in a very late-stage base. Late-stage bases can work but are less likely to be big winners and more likely to fail.Amazon rose 4% to 1,517.96 on Thursday, back above its 50-day line.Intel EPS leapt 32% to 87 cents as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant also guided higher for the current quarter, with sales up 10%. That would be the third straight quarter of accelerating top-line growth.Intel vaulted 5.75% to 56.10 in premarket trading. That indicates Intel will easily reclaim a 53.88 flat-base buy point briefly claimed last week.Microsoft revenue rose 16% to $26.8 billion as earnings swelled 36% to 95 cents a share in its fiscal third quarter. Like Amazon, Microsoft is benefiting from cloud-computing offerings. The Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes server and Azure cloud infrastructure services, saw revenue pop 17% to $7.9 billion.Microsoft shares initially fell before turning up late Thursday. Early Friday, the stock rose 3.3% to 97.35. That would put Microsoft just above a 97.34 flat-base entry.Nasdaq-listed SVB Financial earned $3.63 a share, up 90% vs. a year earlier and 50 cents above views. Revenue swelled 34% to 575 million, also comfortably beating analyst estimates.The IBD 50 stock was not yet active early Friday but leapt 6.85% to 275 in late trade.

911,CL,"Staffing provider Kelly Services (KELYA) has been a mixed story in terms of breakouts in 2017 and so far this year.In May, the stock cleared a 22.94 entry in a cup-with-handle base. Volume was strong on the nearly year-ago breakout, but the small-cap stock rose only 7% before beginning a new consolidation.The next  pattern was a double-bottom with a 24.10 buy point. Volume was missing as the stock climbed above the buy point, so this move wasn't a valid entry.(The lack of volume pointed to a lack of institutional support. A breakout should have volume at least 40% above average, especially for a small cap.)The lack of volume moved the double-bottom's buy point to the pattern's left side high plus 10 cents (24.80). A late September breakout also lacked volume, but patience was about to win out.Strong trade kicked in Oct. 2 at the opening price of 25.09. At the open, the stock was only 1% above the 24.80 buy point. Volume surged 94% above average.An investor who bought at the Oct. 2 entry enjoyed a 23% ride in less than eight weeks. Using the rule to take profits at 20% to 25%, an investor could've nailed down a 20% gain or close to it.A third consolidation began in November. The stock shaped a 14%-deep base. Although the pattern technically was a flat base, the stock had more the look of a cup base with a 31.03 buy point.Kelly broke out Thursday, but volume was 20% above average, once again too little. On Friday the stock pulled back under the buy point in soft trade. This stock's breakouts story remains unfinished.Earnings vs. the year ago surged 32% and 57% higher in the past two quarters.

Baird analyst Jonathan Komp told Investor's Business Daily. ""There's a lot of capacity and scale they are able to drive with the model.

So expect a clean, new environment in any one you go into.""The entire fitness industry has gotten a boost in recent years as consumers focus on healthier food options and lifestyles.""The gym, health and fitness clubs industry has benefited from recent marketing campaigns aimed at fighting obesity, as well as consumer trends toward improved health,"" IBISWorld's Cohen said.In a recent report, IBIS said it expects fitness industry revenue to grow at an annualized rate of 1.6% to $4 billion over the next five years. That will come ""as the growing proliferation of public health campaigns that raise awareness about health and fitness will prompt more consumers to join gyms, boosting industry demand,"" IBIS said.And Planet Fitness is outperforming others in the space.The IBD 50 member has an earnings-per-share rating of 92 and the gym is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Services Group.

The stock is in buy range after its April 20 breakout from a second-stage flat base with a 40.14 buy point. Earnings are expected in early May.Brick-and-mortar stores face increasing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers. But gyms offer an investment safe haven, Burns said.""All the brick-and-mortar store closures occurring creates lease opportunities,"" he said. ""Gyms and fitness studios are becoming the new anchor tenant and drive traffic into the sectors they are in.""Gyms have always faced competition from companies like Nautilus (NLS) which sells home use equipment. There's also P90X, which offers DVD or streaming workouts to do at home.""But when you look at wellness and health trends, the fastest-growing area is in people who like to exercise at gyms more frequently than at home because they like the social aspect of it,"" Burns said.Overall, technology has helped the gym routine. Planet Fitness updated its app and is modernizing its equipment. That makes streaming entertainment providers like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Spotify (SPOT) easier to use at the gym, Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a recent note to clients.The app and Black Card membership allow Planet Fitness gym goers to monitor their progress in a number of metrics like distance run or calories burned.Trendy cycling classes like SoulCycle or high-end yoga boutiques that can cost $30 a session aren't a major concern for Planet Fitness. The gym's $10-a-month membership for a fitness center that's open 24 hours a day offers a good complement to other, more expensive class offerings, R.W. Baird's Komp said.Still, Planet Fitness has inexpensive regional rivals with which it must contend.One rival, Crunch, has 225 franchised gyms with personal trainers, which Planet Fitness doesn't have. Crunch also has a wide variety of classes and boasts a judgment-free and inclusive environment starting at $9.95. Other brands include Retro Fitness in the northeast and YouFit in the southwest.But Komp said those gyms are just a fraction of the size of what Planet Fitness is operating at today. Planet Fitness' size and strong franchise system gives it a big advantage, he adds.After conquering the U.S., Planet Fitness still has room to grow overseas, in addition to Canada and Latin America.""We haven't qualified how large (Planet Fitness' global operations) could be, but the international fitness industry is (several times) the size of the U.S. alone,"" Komp said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: CEO Chris Rondeau Builds Muscle At Planet FitnessStocks To Watch: See Which Names Just Added To, Cut From IBD Screens

Data released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute signaled a surprise 2.64 million barrel rise in weekly inventories, vs. expectations for a 1.1-million barrel decline.The 10-year yield was effectively flat at 3.02%. Bond markets have become a focal point for many investors, as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged above 3% on Tuesday. That was the first move above 3% in more than four years. Rising yields occur when bond prices decline. This typically indicates decreased demand for bonds, which isn't generally a negative for the stock market. In fact, when bond prices decrease and yields rise, stocks usually rise as investor capital shifts from one market to the other.Rising yields are a general indicator of the environment of rising rates created by the Federal Reserve's strategy to begin normalizing target interest rates for banks. The Fed began lowering those target rates from a peak of 5.25% in 2006. The target rates remained abnormally low — below 1% — between 2008 and 2017, following the U.S. economic recession. The Fed began hiking its rate target back above 1% in June last year. It has since implemented two subsequent increases. Markets expect three more increases this year.For consumers, rising rates means things like mortgages and credit card debt are more expensive. For companies, it increases the cost to borrow capital. But there are a long list of industries that benefit from rising risk environments, and it is a welcome change for most fixed-income investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Is The Bull Market Finally Over?Despite Today's Market, Baozun And Solaredge Technologies Join This IBD Stock ListApple Stock Falls For Fifth Straight Day As Wall Street In 'Full Panic Mode'Google Earnings Raise Questions On Amazon.com Rivalry, SpendingFacebook, Twitter, Boeing, PayPal, Visa Earnings: Action Plan

956,CL,"Nike (NKE) VP of Footwear Greg Thompson is the latest executive leaving his role at the company amid an internal review spurred by concerns of hiring and pay inequities, as well as workplace misconduct. Where this leaves the future of leadership at the world's largest athletic brand is unclear.The wave of exits began with Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards, once seen as a potential successor to CEO Mark Parker, who stepped down from his role in March. His lieutenant Jayme Martin, VP and general manager of global categories, was reportedly forcibly ousted around the same time.Antoine Andrews, VP of diversity, has also stepped down, per Monday reports. And two more have been ousted in recent days. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late Tuesday the departures of Vikrant Singh, a Nike Basketball senior brand director in North America, and Daniel Tawiah, a VP of global brand digital-marketing innovation.The reasons for their forced exits are unclear. Female employees reportedly circulated a survey discussing inappropriate behavior, pay levels and gender imbalances at the company. A ""boy's club""-like environment is said to pervade the sportswear titan.""We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment,"" said Parker in the company's earnings call in mid-March. ""I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every Nike employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential.""But he also said in that same call that Nike has a ""deep leadership bench,"" and did not appear at the time to be outwardly concerned about replacing talent, though those comments only followed the departures of Edwards and Martin.Nike shares closed down 0.7% at 65.73 on the stock market today, after losing 1.9% Wednesday. Under Armour (UAA) dipped 0.1%, and Adidas (ADDYY) sold off 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

960,CL,"The 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years, reflecting expectations that the Fed will hike its key rate four times in 2018. Stocks, which have struggled as Treasury rates have rallied strongly in recent sessions, sold off sharply yet again.Fed expectations are fluid. Around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the CME Group FedWatch page showed roughly 53% odds of a fourth quarter-point rate hike coming in December, up from one-in-four odds after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.But as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones both closed 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.3%, the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to just below 3% and odds of a fourth Fed hike slipped to 39%.Bank stocks were among the better performers in afternoon trade on the stock market today. But Bank of America (BAC) reversed lower for a 0.4% decline as the market closed, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 0.5%. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are both still below their 50-day lines.Superregional Fifth Third Bank (FITB) surged 4.1% after soundly beating earnings estimates, but was well off session highs. West Coast-based Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) gained 1.4%, extending its recent breakout.Bank stocks can see a big benefit from higher long-term rates if the spread vs. short-term rates widens. But the big move in the 10-year in recent weeks has seen narrowing spreads.While a higher 10-year Treasury means higher mortgage rates for home buyers, housing stocks got a lift initially Tuesday from strong earnings and housing data. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped higher on strong earnings, rising 2.9%, while Lennar (LEN) fell 1.7% and D.R. Horton (DHI) advanced 0.6%.March new home sales rose 4% to a 694,000 annual rate, well above the 630,000 rate expected and not far off November's 11-year high. Also, the Case Shiller 20-City Home Composite Price Index rose 6.8% from a year ago in March, the best gain since June 2014.Still, Tuesday's market action suggests, at least in the near term, that higher market interest rates may pose a hurdle for the S&P 500 and and the stock market generally as it aims to shake off the recent correction.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March. And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting. Fed policymakers who want to move gradually but are concerned about the economy overheating will privately cheer financial markets moving proactively, essentially doing the Fed's work for it.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Not Just Apple: Treasury Yields Hit 4-Year High As Fed, Inflation Fears MountHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomThe Big Picture: Stocks Sputter As Indexes Struggle To Cross This Key LevelLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

963,CL,"Stock market futures edged lower for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100, with chip stocks coming under pressure for a second session. But they indicate that the major averages will continue to hold above their 50-day moving averages after vaulting above that key level Tuesday. One premarket winner is Amazon.com (AMZN), which revealed that it has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members.Customers pay Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) real money for their services. Meanwhile, fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have offered free services in which users pay in ""data."" But that free-data, ad-driven model has come under fire in the wake of the Facebook data-privacy scandal. This divide is stark in the FANG stocks' performance.(Apple (AAPL), which is sometimes included in a FAANG stock grouping, is a more extreme example of the dollars-vs.-data model. Apple gets customers — and wireless providers — to pay up for the iPhone, while stressing privacy and not selling users' data.)S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%. Dow Jones futures were just below break-even.Amazon has vaulted 69% over the past year to Wednesday's close. Shares rose about 1.6% before the open in the stock market today. Late Wednesday, CEO Jeff Bezos disclosed Amazon Prime membership has topped 100 million, the first time the company disclosed any specific figures for Prime users.

The stock sold off sharply in late March on revelations that Cambridge Analytica had unauthorized data on some 87 million Facebook users. The social giant said third parties have likely scrapped data from most of its two billion users. The stock has recouped some losses, helped by a decent performance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg at congressional hearings. But Facebook shares have been lagging the S&P 500 since Nov. 1.Facebook user growth is slowing, new regulations are likely, and the company is spending more to root out fake news and Russian interference. To make matters worse, Amazon appears to be grabbing a bigger piece of the online ad market, cutting into Facebook and Google.Alphabet shares have climbed 26% in the last 12 months, up slightly in 2018. Facebook's woes hit Alphabet shares somewhat, amid concerns about how regulators might target Google's own data practices. Alphabet's RS line hasn't made much headway in the past year. The stock did retake its 50-day line on Tuesday.As for Apple, the iPhone maker also is up 26% over the past year. The stock is up modestly in 2018, approaching a new 183.60 buy point. Apple dipped 0.2% to 177.84 on Wednesday. The RS line is at consolidation highs but hasn't made much progress in 11 months.On the downside, the stock's recent advance has been in light volume.Apple was off 1.4% in premarket trading.

965,CL,"The first commandment when conducting public relations?""Thou shall tell the truth,"" says Harold Burson, the legendary 97-year-old founder of PR giant Burson-Marsteller, which has over 77 offices on six continents. He's also the author of ""The Business of Persuasion.""Paul Blanchard, author of ""Fast PR: Give Yourself A Huge Media Boost,"" says companies and businesspeople who choose not to hire a PR agency can learn how to implement their own internally as long as they are ambitious about it.Tips on conducting and implementing public relations:Be consistent. Communicate with a single voice, Burson says, as ""that's the overriding objective of a public relations program.""It's also why ""the chief public relations or communication officer should report to the chief executive officer, the only person entitled to speak for the totality of the institution,"" he said.Match words to actions. Communication and behavior go hand in hand, Burson says. ""How you behave always trumps what you say.""Get real. Build relationships, not just email lists.""Don't spam journalists with press releases, because you'll irritate them, and they'll go in the trash anyway,"" Blanchard says.He says it's better to identify five applicable journalists by name and try to build relationships with them. ""Take them out for coffee or lunch. Be interested in them.""Not only will these journalists be more receptive to your emails, but if they know you're reliable, friendly and easy to reach, ""then they can save themselves the time and the effort of contacting a dozen other people and speak to you directly if they need expert comment,"" Blanchard says.Use LinkedIn. Many journalists take themselves off media databases so they can avoid the hundreds of press releases ""thoughtlessly sent their way each day,"" but they remain on LinkedIn, Blanchard says. (LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft (MSFT).)""LinkedIn gives you the opportunity to find out a little more about the journalists you'd like to speak to, and it gives you another way of establishing contact in a personal and friendly way,"" he says.Research. If you're serious about developing your company's profile in the media, you have to roll your sleeves up, get out there and do your homework. Do as much as your time allows and get ahead of the competition.Blanchard suggests listing your competitors and seeing what their CEOs have been doing to raise their own profiles. For example, has that CEO spoken at a conference recently? Then contact that conference and make yourself available as a potential speaker too.Create Google (GOOGL) Alerts for relevant people and publications. If you disagree with something that someone in your industry has said in the media, ""contact the journalist who covered the story and offer the other side of the argument,"" he says. ""Suggest a follow-up article, and try to generate more of a buzz around the issue.""Don't guess. A common mistake spokespeople make, especially in crisis situations, is speculating publicly before verifying facts, Burson has found.It's better to know nothing than to have wrong information, he says. ""The best answer in those early tense moments is: 'I don't have the answer to that question; I will give you an answer when I have the facts.' ""Be a thought leader. This is absolutely essential for business leaders who want to raise their profiles, Blanchard says. It ""runs alongside, and builds upon, corporate PR.""Say, for example, you sell travel trailers; you should also be talking in the media about that industry. While no one in the media is likely to invite someone to talk about how their sales of travel trailers are doing, ""if sales are down across the board they are likely to invite someone to talk about the state of the industry from the perspective of someone in it,"" he said.Burson: ""To achieve success in public relations … communicate well in writing and in speaking, always be thinking about what else you can do for your clients or employer, and take the initiative.""

966,CL,"While the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, solid losses the last two days on the major stock indexes are a bit worrisome. With that weakness, breakouts among top growth stocks like Align Technology (ALGN) over the past several weeks have produced mixed results. The condition of recent breakouts provides a great deal of insight into the strength of the broader market.Among top financial stocks, retail brokerage firms E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) both announced strong quarterly earning results during the week, but reactions were mixed.E-Trade topped earnings estimates Thursday, sparking an advance Friday to the highest level since November 2007 and moving the stock out of buy range.The stock broke out on March 9 in heavy volume above a 56.10 cup-shaped base entry. After a brief pullback to the 50-day line, where it found support, the stock is trading out of the 5% buy range that tops out at 58.91.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

While the stock's reaction on earnings wasn't great, the stock is still holding up despite the past two days of weakness in the stock market, so patience is justified.Canada Goose (GOOS) surged above a 36.76 cup-with-handle entry Thursday, as volume increased 80% above average. The IPO Leader and SwingTrader idea was trading modestly below the entry Friday afternoon. This is another breakout that may take some patience.Leaderboard member Planet Fitness (PLNT) is trading tightly in its 5% buy range after a solid breakout on April 17. The relative strength line — inked in blue on every MarketSmith chart — is hitting new highs, underscoring the stock's strength.On the downside, Align Technology plunged nearly 9% Thursday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from overweight to equal-weight. The stock's fall triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal from a 277.42 cup-with-handle entry.However, there were two major flaws in the stock's basing pattern. First, the cup with handle was a later-stage base, which increases the risk of failure. Second, the stock's breakout on April 18 could only be described as meek. The stock briefly poked above the entry before closing just under it, and volume was tepid.The breakout day should leave no doubt as to the stock's strength, with a volume increase of at least 40% above average.Elsewhere, LGI Homes (LGIH) faltered Thursday amid weakness within the overall homebuilder group. Shares were about 1% below the 72.10 cup-with-handle entry.RELATED:S&P 500 Rises On Netflix, Oil, But Chips, Apple Tumble: Weekly ReviewBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis3 Rules For How To Buy Stocks Like Salesforce During Earnings Season

Bulls prefer to see a stock consolidate above that key support line.Global has a market cap of about $18 billion.Which of the three stocks is best?

975,CL,"Facebook (FB) is building a team to design its own semiconductors, adding to a trend among technology companies to lower their dependence on chipmakers such as Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM), sources say.XThe social media giant seeks a manager to build an ""end-to-end SoC/ASIC, firmware and driver development organization,"" according to a job listing on Facebook's website.

It also would be able to better tune its software and hardware together.Facebook declined to comment on the job postings.A system on chip, or SOC, is a type of semiconductor that contains several discrete components built into one piece of silicon. They're typically used in mobile devices where their space and power-saving properties are more valuable. The main functions of most smartphones are provided by SOCs.An ASIC, or applications specific integrated circuit, is a chip designed for a narrow purpose. Such components are often the fastest or most-efficient at running a particular piece of software. But they're locked down and may become redundant over time if software and workloads evolve.The postings didn't make it clear what kind of use Facebook wants to put the chips to other than the broad umbrella of artificial intelligence. A job listing references ""expertise to build custom solutions targeted at multiple verticals including AI/ML,"" indicating that the chip work could focus on a processor for artificial intelligence tasks.Facebook AI researcher Yann LeCun tweeted about some of the job postings on Wednesday, asking for candidates interested in designing chips for AI.

995,CL,"Free Speech: We can remember when the left used to accuse conservatives of being prudish censors. Now it's the left that appears determined to censor speech it doesn't like. And they appear to have three incredibly powerful allies in their quest: Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.The CEO's of those tech giants — Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Susan Wojcicki — routinely describe their services as neutral platforms, fiercely committed to openness and free expression.""Twitter stands for freedom of expression,"" Dorsey once declared. Twitter's general manager in the U.K. once called it ""the free speech wing of the free speech party.""YouTube parent Google claims that ""the flow of ideas and open access to information on the web helps communities grow and nations prosper.""Zuckerberg told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Facebook is ""a platform for all ideas.""But lately, these sites are starting to act more like the speech police: blocking, censoring or stigmatizing posts and videos they don't like under the gauzy notion of improving public discourse or protecting people from ""fake news.""At his Senate hearing, for example, Zuckerberg told Sen. Ted Cruz that Facebook (FB) will ban ""anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community.""He also bragged that his company will soon have artificial intelligence tools to ""proactively police and enforce safety across the community.""Twitter's Dorsey tweeted in early March that ""we're committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable toward progress."" He also said that Twitter (TWTR) is building a ""systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking."" Fast Company reports that Dorsey has been personally involved in deciding what Twitter accounts to ban or downgrade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLate last year, YouTube (parent company, Alphabet) announced that it would stigmatize videos, even if they didn't violate its terms of service, if it deemed them to ""contain controversial religious or supremacist content."" Those videos, it said ""will be placed in a limited state"" meaning they ""won't be recommended, won't be monetized, and won't have key features including comments, suggested videos, and likes.""Whatever this is, it ain't ""free speech.""So, just who are the people who've appointed themselves as arbiters of what counts as ""healthy"" or ""civil"" speech, or decides what is controversial or makes people feel unsafe? Can we count on them to be fair and unbiased judges? You decide.YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki is a major league Democratic donor. Since 2012, she's handed over a total of $96,600 to the DNC, according to Federal Election Commission records.She gave $5,000 to Obama's campaign in 2012, and $5,400 to Clinton's campaign. She backed far left Sen. Kamala Harris and has donated money to various state Democratic parties.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey isn't much of a campaign contributor, at least not monetarily. His last campaign donations were in 2012, when he gave $5,000 to Democrat Richard Carmona in his run against Sen. Jeff Flake.But Dorsey has been described as ""an ardent leftist who has campaigned with radicals like DeRay Mckesson."" And he recently raised a stir after tweeting a link to an article published in Medium, which basically calls for an end to the Republican party and a California-style one-party state nationwide. ""America finally needs to take the Republican Party down for a generation or two,"" the authors write.""Great read,"" Dorsey said of the article.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn't as easy to pin down ideologically as Dorsey or Wojcicki. He's given plenty of money to Democrats — including $10,000 to the San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee, and campaign contributions to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. But he's also given money to Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch and Marco Rubio, as well as John Boehner.Whatever Zuckerberg's own political leanings, it's clear that plenty of his employees aren't nearly as balanced as he is.Facebook recently blocked the site of two pro-Trump black women — called Diamond and Silk — which has some 1.3 million followers. Facebook told them that their ""content and brand"" were ""unsafe to the community."" Zuckerberg told a House panel this week that ""our team made an enforcement error.""Funny how these sorts of ""enforcement errors"" only seem to happen to conservatives.Facebook ""mistakenly"" suppressed conservative news from its trending topics list until 2016. It's new algorithm for deciding what shows up in news feeds just happens to hit conservative news sites hardest.Last year, Facebook blocked a dozen conservative Catholic sites, blaming its ""spam detection mechanism. It recently banned an ad for a Catholic university in Ohio because it included an image of a crucifix. Incredibly, Facebook's reason was that this image — which is central to the Catholic Church — was ""shocking, sensational or excessively violent.""YouTube's content police, meanwhile, deemed academic videos that express conservative views on Dennis Prager's Prager U channel to be unfit for general consumption. Various other conservatives say they've had their videos shunted off to the YouTube demonetization ghetto. Earlier this year, YouTube moderators deleted several conservative videos and channels across the platform, which YouTube later said were ""mistaken removals."" The site most recently took down several gun-related videos.Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Twitter ""shadowbans"" their tweets — by blocking them from showing up in followers' feeds.The company has repeatedly denied this, but undercover reporters for Project Veritas caught Twitter employees appearing to admit to the practice. And when Independent Journal Review editor Caleb Hull complained that people weren't seeing his tweets, Twitter admitted that he'd been ""mistakenly caught by our spam filters.""When in doubt, blame the spam filters.Now, to be clear, we are the first to defend a company's right to run its business the way it sees fit, even if it means blocking certain people from its sites. And we oppose intrusive government regulation of these companies.But that doesn't absolve Facebook, Twitter or YouTube from attacks for their glaring political biases, or their rank hypocrisy about free speech, or for misleading users about what they are and how they operate.

Fellow Dow Jones stocks Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Visa (V) are near buy points in sound bases. These blue chips' relative strength lines have already hit new highs, a very bullish signal.The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, is always a good way to determine if a stock is a leader or laggard. It's a specialty breakout tool for investors, because an RS line hitting a new high with or ahead of a stock is particularly bullish.Intel's low-volume breakout attempt is not a great sign, and several other stocks hit buy points Wednesday in tepid trade. Looking back, Apple, Intel, Microsoft and Visa had been rising in recent sessions on light trade, suggesting a lack of institutional support. UnitedHealth has had back-to-back gains in strong volume, especially with Tuesday's estimate-beating earnings.Apple, Intel and Microsoft account for three of the five Dow Jones tech stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is acting well, with its RS line just below a new high.

1000,CL,"Shares of Alibaba stock, one of the best Chinese stocks in recent years, have been suffering from a lack of buying demand. The weakness comes after a bullish follow-through day for the Nasdaq last week.A breakout during the week ended Jan. 26 was powerful as shares of Alibaba (BABA) surged 11.5% in strong volume. But new buyers were disappointed when shares lost nearly 9% the following week in higher volume. Volume during that down week surged 50% above the 10-week average as well.Big sellers in a stock immediately after a breakout is never a good sign. In Alibaba's case, it foreshadowed more price weakness.Alibaba's stock is currently testing support at the 200-day moving average, a longer-term support level. The test comes after Alibaba gapped below the 50-day line on March 22 in heavy volume.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHow can a stock like Alibaba turn into a laggard amid seemingly bright fundamentals?Sales growth accelerated nicely in the latest reported quarter, up 66% from a year ago to $12.75 billion. In Q3 last year, the top line increased 47%. For the current quarter, sales are seen rising 52% to $9.28 billion. Annual earnings estimates are also robust, with EPS this year expected to rise 54% from 2017 to $5.27.The lack of buying interest is due, in part, to a slowdown in institutional demand. Alibaba's up-down volume ratio is a tepid 1.0, while its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has faltered to C- on a scale of A to E.Several recent higher-volume declines are the culprit. Alibaba stock is not under heavy distribution, but signs of institutional selling started in early February. Three above-average volume declines from Feb. 1-5 were a sign of it.New signs of institutional buying would strengthen Alibaba's technical picture. Watch for higher-volume gains from here. The stock's 50-day moving average is a potential resistance level to watch. But if mutual funds and other big investors start buying shares again, a move back above the 50-day line is possible.A double-bottom pattern could even form, but note that Alibaba's latest pullback didn't undercut the low of the prior base (164.25). That means any new base that forms would be the third-stage variety after a strong move in 2017. A general rule of thumb is to buy breakouts from early-stage bases, not later-stage patterns.Keep in mind that when stocks move they tend to move in groups, and that appears to be the case with China stocks in general. In the latest IBD 50, for example, buying demand has also dried up in China Lodging (HTHT), TAL Education (TAL) and Weibo (WB).For now, the top China name in the IBD 50 is Baozun (BZUN), which continues to hold near highs.RELATED:Alibaba Invests Another $2 Billion Into Leading SE Asia E-Commerce Site LazadaBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues

1001,CL,"U.S.-listed China stocks were big losers in Friday's trading, including Alibaba (BABA), Baozun (BZUN), Weibo (WB), Sina (SINA), Tencent (TCEHY), Tal Education (EDU) were among the notable Chinese stocks underperforming the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average. However, one new Chinese IPO, iQiyi (IQ) extended Thursday's breakout from a short IPO base.Autohome (ATHM) was one U.S.-listed China stock that held up reasonably well. Shares of the auto information site fell 2.65%, but from Thursday's record high. Autohome is well extended from a breakout.Baozun, Weibo and Tal Education are members of the IBD 50 list and a big reason why that elite list underperformed Friday.It wasn't clear what drove these China stocks lower. China reported a rare trade deficit in March as exports fell, raising concerns about economic growth.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseU.S.-China trade war tensions have ebbed for the moment, but these U.S.-listed Chinese stocks aren't that affected by trade. Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce giant, but it doesn't have much exposure to the U.S. itself. That same goes for social site Weibo and for-profit school stock Tal Education.Chinese social sites do face the risk of running afoul of Chinese censors. Weibo said Friday that it was removing gay and violent content from its site. That comes after Web portal Toutiao pulled an app that regulators said was vulgar.But Chinese internets try hard to stay in Beijing's good graces, and act quickly when regulators crack down. Also, censor risks wouldn't seem to apply to Chinese stocks like Tal or Baozun, which helps Western brands with China e-commerce strategies.Perhaps China stocks were just out of favor. Whatever the reason, investors need to focus on the price and volume action of specific names, groups and the overall market.Baidu (BIDU) web streaming unit iQiyi, called the Netflix (NFLX) of China, rose 1.5% to 19.33, hitting a new high. Shares rose 5.4% to 19.04 on Thursday, clearing a very short IPO base with an 18.62 buy point.

1002,CL,"Data Breach: Every day, it seems, Facebook faces new troubles on the privacy front. But there's one breach that Facebook executives still have not accounted for. Namely, the wholesale transfer of user data to the Obama campaign in 2012.The latest privacy flap came when Facebook (FB) announced on Sunday that it was suspending data analytics firm CubeYou from its platform, pending an audit, after CNBC reported that the firm was collecting user data through Facebook quizzes, which CubeYou claimed was ""for nonprofit academic research"" but was reportedly shared with marketers.On Monday, Facebook started sending notices to uses whose data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. It now says that an app — developed by an U.K.-based academic in 2013 and called ""This Is Your Digital Life"" — could have collected Facebook data on 87 million users. Cambridge, which at one point was advising the Trump campaign, got hold of the data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress Monday, telling lawmakers ""I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.""Meanwhile, consumer groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. They allege that Facebook's facial recognition software violates users' privacy rights.The Cambridge Analytica data breach was a violation of trust, no doubt. But there is clearly a political dimension to the intense, ongoing frenzy it unleashed. The story became an instant scandal because the Trump campaign was part of it.But it was hardly the first time Facebook users had their information unwittingly scooped up by a political campaign.As we've noted in this space, the Obama campaign, apparently with the eager assistance of Facebook itself, managed to gather up data possibly on every user at the time by encouraging people to sign up to the campaign website using their Facebook ID, which gave the campaign not only access to their data, but data on their Facebook friends. Which apparently included every U.S. user at the time.As Obama campaign staffer Carol Davidsen tweeted after the Cambridge story broke, ""Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realized what we were doing.""This effort was widely known at the time. In fact, campaign officials bragged about it and multiple news outlets wrote glowing stories about the sophistication of the Obama campaign's use of the social media platform to precisely target key campaign messages.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt is true that the Obama campaign was more upfront and honest with those signing up about how they planned to use the data than the ""Digital Life"" app was. But that distinction is meaningless to the tens of millions of their friends who, in both cases, had their Facebook data scraped for political purposes without their knowledge or consent.What's more, unlike the Cambridge data breach, the Obama campaign — as well as Facebook — might have violated campaign laws by making and accepting in-kind donations.Yet even now, no one is pressuring Facebook executives to explain what happened to all that data the Obama campaign collected. No one is calling on Facebook to send messages to its users letting them know if Obama's data mavens Hoovered up their information.And while the press keeps pressuring Facebook executives with questions about Cambridge Analytica, none bothers to ask them about what Facebook was doing in 2012.Yes, 2012 was a long time ago, relatively speaking, but there are nevertheless important questions that still need answering.Namely, is it true that Facebook let the Obama campaign access data in ways that no other organizations could? How many users had their data scraped by the campaign? Did any other groups outside the Obama campaign have access to this data? Where did all the data end up? Do Democrats still have access to it? Are they still using it?If Facebook is going to come clean about its past privacy problems, it can't ignore this part of the story.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Did Facebook Break The Law To Help Obama Win In 2012?Zuckerberg Starts Talking, And Makes Facebook's Problems Even WorseFunny, When Obama Harvested Facebook Data On Millions Of Users To Win In 2012, Everyone Cheered

1005,CL,"Facebook (FB) shares jumped 4.5% Tuesday afternoon as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg seemed to calm investor fears in handling a barrage of questions from U.S. senators about the data privacy scandal that has embroiled the social media giant.In his first testimony on Capitol Hill scheduled this week, Zuckerberg was grilled on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It involves the personal information on 87 million users that was wrongfully obtained without their knowledge. Zuckerberg also faced questions on how it can prevent hate speech, propaganda and other forms of undesired content.The 33-year-old Zuckerberg, dressed in suit and tie, responded to each question from senators, many well more than double his age. He appeared to patiently explain technology that some of them didn't understand. Frequently, the questions focused on how and why they should trust Facebook with their private information.""We have made a lot of mistakes,"" said Zuckerberg, going back to the launch of Facebook. ""Now we're going through a broader technological shift, with new (artificial intelligence) tools in hand to take a more proactive role.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who he thought was the main competitor to Facebook. Graham asked if the social network held a monopoly in its field.""It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,"" Zuckerberg said.To which Graham asked: ""If I don't like Facebook where can I go?"" He added: ""Is there an alternative in the private sector?""Zuckerberg replied there are a number of rivals who offer some of the same services as Facebook such as Twitter (TWTR).Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, probed the company on political bias, which Zuckerberg denied.""I am very committed to be sure Facebook is a platform for all ideas,"" Zuckerberg said.Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., seemed to throw the young CEO off base when he asked Zuckerberg whether he could share the name of the hotel he was staying, or who he contacted recently. Zuckerberg said no, to which Durbin contended that is the kind of privileged information that sometimes gets out to wide audiences via the social network.Otherwise, Zuckerberg responded to a slew of questions on privacy and use of Facebook information without seeming to be caught off guard. His replies often fell back on Facebook having either solved the problem, was working to solve the problem or that he needed to follow up.He'll testify again on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, starting at 10 a.m. ET, livestreamed here. This week's hearings are expected to be media spectacles, with wall-to-wall coverage.Overall, the hearings could result in a titanic political struggle over regulating social media companies, including Twitter and the YouTube unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).In November, officials from Facebook, Twitter and Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Russian efforts to spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDropbox, Spotify, Bilibili and iQiyi all came public within the past month. All four have valuations above $1 billion, making them tech unicorns. The stocks have consolidated briefly, but their relative strength lines have been at or near record highs, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500.While all four new listings are growing strongly, they are still unprofitable. You can find profitable IPOs, including hot Brazilian payments firm PagSeguro Digital (PAGS), on the IPO Leaders stock list. The data storage provider came public at 21 a share, rising 36% to 28.47 in its March 23 debut. The stock hit a new high of 34.37 intraday on March 29. It's consolidated since then. Dropbox popped 3.5% to 32.32 on the stock market today, a new closing high.Spotify technically wasn't an IPO at all. The stock was a direct listing on April 3. The stock opened at 165.90 and hit 169 intraday before closing at 149.01. Shares fell 3.4% to 149.57 on news that top rival Apple (AAPL) Music hit 40 million subscribers.Baidu's majority-owned internet TV streaming unit priced at 18, but didn't have a great debut on March 29. Shares rose to 18.52 intraday but closed at 15.55. But after a few days, iQiyi began turning higher. The stock rose 3.8% to 18.07, a new closing high.While called the Netflix of China, iQiyi actually licenses Netflix content in China.As for Netflix, the FANG stock rose 1.9% to 303.67 on Wednesday in volume that was 29% above normal, continuing the stock's rebound from the 50-day line. That action creates a new buying opportunity, but with Netflix reporting earnings on Monday investors should be wary. Netflix is an IBD Leaderboard stock.Bilibili came public at 11.50 a share. The stock fell as low as 9.62 in its March 28 debut, closing at 11.24. Shares hit a record high of 11.80 intraday on March 29, as iQiyi debuted but reversed lower. Since then shares have consolidated in a smaller range. Bilibili dipped 0.2% to 11.48 on Wednesday.The Chinese-based online company makes most of its money from mobile games. But it's also positioning itself as a video-streaming firm like Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit YouTube, iQiyi or Netflix.IPOs are important because they offer fast-growing companies, often with new ideas and markets. But investors should avoid buying an IPO on the first few days, because of the high risk that the stock will swing wildly. Let a stock shake out and form an IPO base or other bullish pattern. IPO bases can be extremely short, but breakouts from these patterns offer investors a chance to jump into a new stock with better odds of success.IPO bases and breakouts can be wild, so be ready to cut losses quickly. Also be aware of the market environment. IPOs tend to be more volatile than the broader averages and even the typical growth stock.

1009,CL,"Ford Motor (F) reportedly plans to operate its own self-driving-car network on a large scale by 2021 to transport people and goods.XRather than sell its technology to a ride-hailing operator, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker will operate a network of custom-built autonomous vehicles itself, Jim Farley, Ford's global markets president, told the Financial Times in an interview in London.That would align Ford's plans with those of General Motors (GM) and Renault-Nissan (NSANY), which plan to run their own self-driving fleets, vs. the likes of Volvo and Tata Motors' (TTM) Jaguar Land Rover, which plan to sell driverless vehicles to ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo, the Times noted.GM plans a large-scale launch of its robotaxis next year, while Nissan plans to launch its service, called Easy Ride, in the early 2020s.""The key message from Ford is we're not looking just to start then (in 2021),"" Farley said. ""We're setting up the Miami business model now so that we can scale then.""Ford's service also will have key difference with GM, the Times noted. It will use a new vehicle powered by hybrid technology and also will carry people and cargo interchangeably, suggesting a larger vehicle such as a Transit van. GM will use a version of its Chevrolet Bolt EV hatchback.""One of the most important parts of the test is the business model itself,"" Farley said, to establish how revenue is split, how much consumers will pay for a self-driving delivery, and at what price the service is useful to customers such as logistics or delivery companies. Ford also plans to open its network to local small businesses to transport goods, taking on rivalry local courier services.Ford announced in 2016 it would launch a so-called robotaxi service by 2021; last year it bought Argo AI, an artificial-intelligence firm, for $1 billion to take on General Motors and Waymo in developing self-driving cars. And Ford in February declared it was ""headed to Florida to test and prove out our business model"" by using self-driving technology for pizza deliveries in a pact with Domino's Pizza (DPZ).Shares of Ford closed up 0.9% at 11.38 on the stock market today.

1010,CL,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

"
1015,CL,"Before two fatal self-driving-car accidents over the last few weeks, the big event this year for autonomous vehicles was supposed to be Waymo's launch of a paid ride-sharing service in Phoenix.Waymo, a stand-alone unit of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) since late 2016, is far ahead in the race toward autonomous cars and planned to be first to market with a commercial robotaxi service. If the Phoenix rollout were to go smoothly later this year, it could boost Waymo's value — some put it as high as $125 billion — as well as light a fire under Alphabet stock.Now the accidents have cast doubt on whether the self-driving car can become the future of personal transport.Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik recently said, ""We're building a bridge to trust."" But now he faces an uphill battle in convincing the public that computer-operated cars are safer than human drivers.And the outlook for self-driving cars overall suddenly seems opaque. Companies racing to build autonomous cars —  including Waymo, Tesla (TSLA), General Motors (GM), Aptiv (APTV), Ford (F) and Daimler (DDAIF) — could go under even more scrutiny when seeking government approval to test self-driving cars on public roads.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Uber Technologies crash that killed pedestrian Elaine Herzberg on March 18 occurred in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, not far from where Waymo plans to launch its service. A federal probe of the crash could take a year, and in the interim, Uber has suspended some of its self-driving-car tests.The National Transportation Safety Board also is investigating the crash of a 2017 Tesla Model X just five days later. The driver, Wei Huang, was killed when the vehicle hit a concrete lane divider in the Silicon Valley community of Mountain View, Calif. Tesla has confirmed the car's autopilot system was engaged at the time. Auto-pilot systems are not the same as driverless vehicles that do not require human input but Tesla is a high-profile developer of the self-driving car.But now that probe could be delayed as well since Tesla was removed Wednesday by the NTSB from actively participating in the investigation for making unauthorized public statements.Bullish analysts are buying what Krafcik has to say, however. They peg Waymo's long-term valuation at anywhere from $41 billion to $125 billion. Those estimates assume Waymo will license its technology to automakers, offer a consumer robotaxi service or find other ways to monetize its driverless system.""The planned launch of a ride-hailing program in Arizona in 2018 puts Waymo on a clearer path to monetization,"" Doug Anmuth, a JPMorgan analyst, said in a recent note to clients. ""We believe the value of Waymo is underrepresented in Alphabet (stock).""Speaking at a National Automobile Dealers Association meeting a few days after the Tempe crash, Krafcik said the Uber ""car had technology representing the self-driving space."" Krafcik said that a Waymo vehicle, which employs different technology, would have avoided hitting a pedestrian in a similar situation.Waymo has been the chief exponent of self-driving cars. The company has launched consumer education campaigns in conjunction with Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups.Krafcik pointed out at last month's South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, that some 1.25 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. Self-driving cars will cut that number down, he predicted.So Waymo is forging ahead in Phoenix and elsewhere. The company announced in late March it will buy 20,000 luxury electric cars starting in 2020 from Jaguar Land Rover to expand its self-driving-car services. Parent Alphabet will foot the bill.Waymo's driverless Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans have logged more than 5 million miles in parts of 25 cities without a fatality. By comparison, Uber's cars had traveled roughly 2 million miles before the fatal crash. Was Waymo just lucky, or is its autonomous technology superior?In Phoenix, Waymo's minivans achieved an industry first by operating over public roads without a human driver available to take over in an emergency. Local residents that joined the early-rider program were given free trips.Waymo last week filed an application in California to expand its its self-driving car program — without human supervisors — in that state.While Waymo leads the industry by far with its 5 million test miles on the self-driving car, observers say it could take tens of billions of test miles before regulators allow autonomous vehicles to be widely deployed. In the wake of the Uber crash, it's not clear whether a self-driving car needs to be merely safer than humans, or nearly perfect.Surveys show that consumers fret about software malfunctions. They also worry that hackers could take over autonomous vehicles and create a demolition derby on city streets.A self-driving car relies on a mix of technologies to pinpoint location, understand surroundings, and predict what things around it will do.Waymo's strengths in artificial-intelligence software, custom-built laser scanning gear and 3D digital mapping technology have made it an early leader. Its stated goal: create the world's most experienced driver.To do that, it plans to continually improve computer algorithms for the self-driving car. These are the artificial-intelligence software programs that aim to replicate the human ability to learn, reason and make decisions.Waymo takes a methodical approach. It's collecting rich data in urban areas and taking in details like the height of curbs, the width of intersections and the precise location of traffic lights and stop signs. That could take years.""The scalability of automated driving is what's in question,"" said Roger Lanctot, analyst at Strategy Analytics. ""Waymo is on a path to brute-forcing its way, city by city, to achieving true autonomy. They're refining the process, trying to shorten the time, of adding a city to the deployment plan.""Approaches differ. Waymo is betting on laser-beam scanning to provide high-resolution 3D imaging. It also has radar for measuring distances and velocity, and advanced cameras to identify signs and traffic lights. Car-roof-mounted laser systems also provide Waymo cars with 360-degree views.For now, Tesla has opted not to use lasers, by far the most costly autonomous technology. Tesla uses cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors. Its ""Level 2"" technology enables cars to handle steering and acceleration, but humans remain in control.General Motors, which plans to launch a robotaxi service in an unidentified  ""dense, urban"" setting in 2019, uses laser systems. GM has undertaken a self-driving-car program using Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles in San Francisco. It's seeking a regulatory green light to build a self-driving car without a steering wheel or pedals.In Phoenix, Waymo has achieved what's called ""Level 4"" automation. Its driverless cars operate without human supervisors but only in a pre-mapped area. Its paid robotaxi service in Phoenix will operate in a 600-square mile area.Phoenix, with 299 sunny days per year on average, is considered an ideal place to launch a commercial service. Laser systems have trouble in rain, snow and fog.The holy grail for Waymo, General Motors and others is building a Level 5 fully autonomous car. The vehicle could go anywhere instructed, including unmapped areas, under any weather conditions. At the NADA conference, Krafcik said a free-range Level 5 autonomous car is a ""very long way out.""Wall Street analysts figure on Waymo making money with Level 4 technology, but just how valuable is Waymo? Bank of America puts it at $41 billion, while Morgan Stanley says it's closer to $70 billion. Jefferies suggests a range of anywhere from $75 billion to $125 billion. That's still a formidable sum, even for a company like Google's parent, with a market cap of more than $700 billion.Waymo has rebounded after losing top engineers who left to form autonomous startups such as Argo, Aurora and Nuro. Krafcik took the helm at Waymo in late 2016. He spent 14 years at Ford and served as CEO of Hyundai Motor America.Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) makes autonomous minivans for Waymo. But Waymo has yet to forge licensing deals for a self-driving car with the likes of Ford and Honda Motor (HMC) despite reports of negotiations. Waymo and Honda are said to be mulling a partnership to build a self-driving car that would deliver goods.At the auto dealers' conference, Krafcik said Waymo's monetization paths include ride-sharing services, self-driving trucks and licensing its software and hardware to traditional automakers. Longer range, he sees opportunities in public transportation in smart cities.""If Waymo just licenses their tech to automakers, they will make money in the short run but lose their predominant position in the long run as self-driving technology is commoditized,"" said Alexander Hars, managing director at Inventivio, a German self-driving consultancy. ""This is OK for the automakers but cannot be the only goal of Waymo.""Waymo has ordered ""thousands"" of Chrysler minivans to increase its fleet as it expands to more cities. It also has partners in Avis Budget Group (CAR) and AutoNation (AN) for servicing and housing its fleet. Trov, a startup backed by the venture-capital subsidiary of Munich Re, will provide trip insurance for passengers using Waymo's ride-hailing service.Krafcik contends ride-sharing services are the most economical business model for the self-driving cars, which are expected to be expensive. A self-driving car could operate around the clock and travel 250,000 miles if deployed in ride-sharing services, he said at the auto dealers' meeting.And, by getting rid of human drivers, ride-sharing services can drive down costs. Industry-leading Uber is still unprofitable.But it's still not clear whether Waymo plans to scale up a worldwide business to challenge Uber or is just out to prove its self-driving-car technology is best-in-class.CapitalG — a venture investment arm of Google's corporate parent, Alphabet — has invested in Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing service provider, behind Uber. Lyft and other ride-sharing startups loom as potential customers of Waymo and manufacturing partners.A Boston Consulting Group study forecasts that 20% of the miles Americans travel on roads in 2030 will be in driverless, ride-share vehicles.Aside from ride-sharing fleets, analysts say autonomous vehicles will be first deployed in gated communities, college campuses, theme parks, airports and warehouse distribution centers — all rangebound locations.Just how much demand there will be from consumers for personal transport is where the rubber hits the road. One common view is that if ride-sharing services take off, consumers will buy fewer cars themselves. At NADA, Krafcik said Level 4 self-driving cars could be in dealer showrooms sooner than people think.A bullish forecast by consultancy McKinsey says that by 2030, fully autonomous cars could account for 15% of passenger vehicles sold worldwide.Much depends on what self-driving technology might cost per vehicle as an options package. Analysts say autonomous technology needs to be in the $5,000-to-$15,000 range, as an added cost on top of the vehicle's base price.That would be a huge drop from prototype autonomous vehicles, which use multiple laser systems, cameras and other sensors. Laser systems have dropped from $75,000 to around $20,000, analysts say. Next-generation, solid-state laser systems may bring the price down to $500 to $1,000 each.A self-driving car also uses multiple backup computers. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) are racing to build specialized chips for processing AI software. Nvidia in March showcased new simulation technology for testing self-driving cars using virtual-reality systems.Nvidia hasn't disclosed pricing for its new ""Xavier"" AI system-on-a-chip for the self-driving car, unveiled in January at the Consumer Electronics Show. The company has told analysts it expects that deployments of the self-driving car will pick up in 2020 — a time frame that may be extended in light of the recent crashes.In the wake of those incidents, designers of autonomous vehicles will be pressured to build redundant software, hardware and sensor technology into vehicles, says Brian Johnson, a Barclays analyst. That approach will impact the cost of autonomous vehicles.""What the (Tempe) episode reinforces is that the conservative approach is likely the best one, and that sensor redundancy is crucial — providing an aviationlike level of safety,"" he said in a report. ""In this environment, we see Waymo, Aptiv and GM positioned with the right skill sets.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:AI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading StocksNissan Takes A Leaf From GM With This Self-Driving TestAutonomous Cars: Why General Motors Is In The Back Seat Vs.

1020,CL,"Think of the cup-with-handle pattern as a launching pad that great stocks use to rocket into huge price runs. But what about the cup base that forms with no handle? Can it work as well?XBut sometimes a dynamic moneymaker is in too much of a hurry to form a handle before blasting up to new highs. Savvy investors also know how to spot a cup base that forms without a handle.A CAN SLIM-type investor always first pays tremendous attention to a company's profits, revenue, profit margins, return on equity and other metrics of growth. But don't look at fundamentals in a vacuum. When it comes to winning the stock trading game, precise timing is of the essence.So it's dangerous and actually foolish to ignore technical analysis, a fancy term for simply rolling up your sleeves and analyzing a stock's behavior via charts.If you ignore price-and-volume action, you are clearly missing out on a significant factor in what makes certain stocks great. Ignoring the ""technicals"" means you disregard the all-powerful forces of supply and demand that drive a stock's price day in, day out, and over much longer time periods.As you would expect, the cup without handle resembles a U.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base starts to develop when a stock begins to decline after an advance of 20% or more from a prior successful breakout. If there was no prior breakout, demand that the stock has risen at least 30% from any given price before it forms a cup pattern.IBD chairman and founder Bill O'Neil says this decline often outpaces the overall market's slide. ""It's normal for growth stocks to create cup patterns during intermediate declines in the general market and to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market averages,"" he writes in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""At the same time, you want the stock to show some resilience too.O'Neil writes: ""Your best choices are generally stocks with base patterns that deteriorate the least during an intermediate market decline. Whether you're in a bull market or a bear market, stock downturns that exceed 2-1/2 times the market averages are usually too wide and loose and must be regarded with suspicion.""You want to see a drop of no more than 30% to 33%. While some cups shaped during severe bear markets can be 40%-50% deep or more and still work out, it's generally smart to focus on stocks that make shallower declines from their 52-week highs.A cup without handle must be at least six weeks long. Most are about three to six months long, and some can span a year or longer. Tight price action is preferable to wide and loose movements. In addition, there should be more up weeks in above-average volume (a sign of accumulation) than down weeks in fast trade (distribution).The buy point for a cup base is 10 cents above the high hit before the base took shape.As with all breakouts, look for the stock to clear its buy point in strong turnover, meaning trade that's at least 40% above its 50-day average.You can quickly see the 50-day average volume of any stock by either going to MarketSmith or viewing an IBD chart. Gen-Probe, an expert in diagnostic tests and blood-screening systems, went public in September 2002 and finished its debut week at around 16 a share. The stock then climbed to 28.45 by February 2003 (1), posting a solid gain of more than 70%. The medical play finally began its first true correction, sinking 27% from that high. investors were watching to see if the stock would clear its buy point of 28.55 in strong volume — or if it would tack on a handle to create a cup-with-handle base.Gen-Probe went with the first option. On the last trading day of April 2003, the stock gapped up 5 points, or 19%, barreling past its 28.55 trigger. Turnover that ballooned 702% above its 50-day average (2).Right before that April 30 breakout, Gen-Probe showed solid IBD ratings: a 97 Composite, 80 EPS, 91 RS, an A+ for industry group RS, B for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) and A- for Accumulation/Distribution. In the April 30 edition of IBD, Gen-Probe got featured in the Nasdaq Stocks In The News column, which is now called Stock Spotlight.The San-Diego-based firm gained 122% in 20 weeks.Not every cup without handle will work out, especially when they show flaws.58.com (WUBA) formed a cup without handle after pulling back in early December 2017. The buy point was 79.89, 10 cents above the left-side high. In the week ended Jan. 5, 2018, the e-commerce and personal ad network showed nice volume in its breakout and the stock rose 11%, surpassing the proper entry.58.com rallied over the next three weeks, but the gain failed to exceed 10%. During the February market sell-off, the stock took its lumps as well. It fell more than 8% below the 79.89 to trigger the most important defensive sell rule in investing and dove sharply back into the base.(Editor's note: A version of this column originally ran in the July 14, 2010, edition of IBD.

1023,CL,"A stock market correction is not the time for bravery in your swing trading strategy. You can pop your head up when the coast seems clear, but you must be ready to duck and cover at the first sign of trouble. GoDaddy (GDDY) stock was a recent casualty of current market pressure.It's tempting to try and time the exact bottom of a stock market correction, but it's difficult in practice. Here's a swing trading strategy to use: Keep your portfolio exposure limited with some test buys at the first signs of a market bounce. Then, find potential swing trades that are exhibiting proper behavior. Look for signs of a reversal or breakout, relative strength, and volume confirmation. If you also see other members of the industry group showing these same signs, that's even better.The more stocks you find, the more conviction the market rally is for real. Fewer stocks should increase your suspicion that the stock market correction may not be over. In either case, it's not the time to get your portfolio back to fully invested. With this swing trading strategy, don't plunge. Dip.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA normal position size, or smaller given the market volatility, leaves a portfolio's exposure low. If the stock market correction continues, keep your loss small on the stock and you'll outperform the market with the reduced exposure. If the market rally works, you've got an early start in building your portfolio back up. You may underperform at first, but will quickly catch up if the market strength continues.When the market showed a bounce on March 29, GoDaddy stock joined IBD's SwingTrader (1). The stock declined with the market in mid-March but with a shallower descent. That's a strong sign of relative strength. It bounced near its 50-day moving average, then jumped 4% on the day of its entry. Its volume at the time already was tracking higher than any day during its pullback (1). The computer software enterprise group ranked No. 2 out of the 197 IBD Industry Groups. Group mates Paycom (PAYC) and ServiceNow (NOW) demonstrated that GoDaddy wasn't alone in its power.However, although it looked good, one day of strength does not end a stock market correction. The next day started well but when the market turned south GoDaddy fell with it. The bearish reversal was an early indicator that the stock and market may need more time. It exited SwingTrader before it took out the stop loss at the entry day low. Rather than a 2.8% loss, we only got nicked 1.3%. GoDaddy was the only active trade at the time. It was our test buy. As a single position, that would translate to a couple tenths of a percent effect on your portfolio. It started showing another sign of a reversal a couple of days later (3). But the stock market correction continues.The best swing trading strategy for handling a stock market correction is to avoid it. If you are going to make an attempt, cutting the loss quickly makes sure you live to fight another day.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.(For additional swing trade and market commentary, you can follow me on Twitter at @IBD_JNielsen)RELATED:Sometimes Less Is More In Trading ActivityDon't Let Stock Losses Steal Your SunshineSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

The rule takes effect May 25, and restricts how personal data is collected and handled.""Facebook could potentially see a negative impact of up to 7% from GDPR, though we would highlight that this impact could be negated completely if it successfully obtains user consent for processing personal data,"" Bellini wrote in a note to clients.The damage to Google, however, won't be nearly as severe, she says.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is to testify before two congressional panels this week on data privacy issues.The GDPR enables consumers to edit, add or delete data that has been collected upon request. It could impact targeted advertising, analysts say.""Given the highly engaged user base and lack of what we would consider a viable alternative social network, we believe Facebook is likely to be successful in obtaining informed consent from the vast majority of its users in the EU,"" added Bellini.

1026,CL,"How can technology and oil stocks mix? One way: When high-quality companies from both sectors rise to new highs.ConocoPhillips (COP) and new IPO Dropbox (DBX) lead a still modest yet growing cadre of companies that burst to 52-week or all-time new highs Thursday. The latter is trying to break out of its first base; the former is trying to pad its gains after a successful breakout from an early-stage base.Dropbox, whose service allows users to access and edit files from multiple computers or internet-enabled devices, burst past a 34.47 buy point in a very narrow IPO base. That base began forming after the stock reversed sharply March 29. The IPO base formed over a period of just eight sessions, far fewer days than the typical successful IPO base.Analysts see the San Francisco-based firm earnings 2 cents a share in the first quarter. It lost 8 cents a share in Q1 and Q2 of 2017 and 4 cents in Q3 and 10 cents in Q4.Revenue jumped 33%, 33%, 30% and 28% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.The company priced 36 million shares at 21 a share in late March.Oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips rose to as high as 63.88, extending gains from a 61.41 entry in a cup without handle to 4%. This means shares are still in buy range. Don't chase a stock more than 5% past the proper buy point.The cup without handle is most visible on a daily chart. But in looking at a weekly chart, it appears that a one-week handle also formed. That ushers in a slightly lower buy point of 61.27, 10 cents above the highest price during last week's action.An earlier Stock Market Today column covered Conoco's breakout in detail Wednesday.Elsewhere, apparel firms are gaining more steam.Business apparel, casual clothing and footwear giant PVH (PVH) moved further past a 158.06 buy point in an excellent flat base. On Thursday, shares reached as high as 162.62, up almost 3%.While volume is running roughly flat vs. the stock's 50-day average turnover, check out its daily chart. Since a March 29 bullish gap up in price, PVH had already registered five significant up days in heavy volume.Such action points to rising institutional demand.The reasons are clear. The owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger apparel brands is showing a fresh streak of top and bottom line growth.Earnings fell vs. year-ago levels in the final two quarters of fiscal 2017, ended in January that year. Then PVH grew its earnings per share by 10%, 15%, 16% and 28% in the next four quarters. In the April-ending fiscal first quarter for this year, the Street sees profit accelerating 36% higher to $2.25 a share.Sales grew 4%, 7%, 5% and 19% in the past four quarters, and are seen rising 15% in the current period to $2.28 billion.Global sports apparel and shoe maker Adidas (ADDYY) rallied as much as 2% and hit as high as 129.81 in afternoon trading Thursday. Shares are now up 11% past a 116.94 buy point in a long saucer with handle.

Italy's Fiat Chrysler is the automaker that spun off exotic carmaker Ferrari (RACE), and which remains in control of the Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Jeep brands, as well as its mainstay Fiat nameplate.But both leading stocks are building bases after powerful rallies.

The stock climbed back above the midpoint of the base's left side over the past two weeks. In the process, it regained its 10-week moving average. It still has a ways to go to the buy point. But a gain like the stock saw in the week ended April 6 — or even less — could put it past the potential buy point at 25.05.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor its part, Weibo is rebounding after a four-week decline that took shares near the 40-week moving average. The stock met some resistance for a few days just above 125, at the underside of its 50-day moving average. The buy point is 142.22.Both stocks hold powerful EPS ratings from IBD. Fiat scores a 98. Weibo clocks in at 99. Analyst consensus projects Weibo's first-quarter year-over-year earnings growth will slow slightly, to 85%, atop a 72% revenue surge. Fiat is expected to post an 80% EPS gain, although revenue growth is forecast to slow to less than 3%. Fiat plans to announce first-quarter results April 26. Weibo has not yet announced its first-quarter reporting date.Other important gauges vary. Fiat's Accumulation/Distribution Rating — a measure that shows buying by large investors — is a healthy B+. Weibo's is a decent C+. Weibo's relative strength line is lagging below its February high. Fiat's RS line is pressing to new highs ahead of a possible breakout — an important indication of vitality.Last, but not least, is the difference in the two stocks' base counts. Weibo is forming a late stage pattern. Its last breakout (which also was late stage) failed.Fiat's base is a third-stage piece of work. That's getting  a little long in the tooth, but suggests the stock has a bit further to run from its next breakout.RELATED: Fiat Chrysler Keeps 2018 Forecast As SUV, Pickup Rollouts SetGoPro Jumps On Possible Takeover Interest From Chinese FirmNew-Car Sales: These 2 U.S. Automakers Roared In MarchBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

""It's time for legislation to prevent incidents like this from happening.""By mid-afternoon Wednesday, Zuckerberg was on his 10th hour of testimony, which started with a joint Senate committee hearing on Tuesday. Wall Street appeared to applaud Zuckerberg's  performance, with Facebook shares rising 4.5% Tuesday and another 1.5% Wednesday.Facebook has rebounded over the past five days from the 19% plunge in its stock, starting on March 16. That followed revelations that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully accessed personal data from 87 million Facebook users — data that was used in the 2016 presidential election.Zuckerberg was grilled on the data privacy issues in addition to how his network can prevent hate speech, propaganda and other forms of undesired content. He also faced questions on who makes those decisions.But the hearings are raising the likelihood that Facebook — along with Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), Amazon (AMZN) and a number of other social media and e-commerce sites — will face regulations that could hinder ad revenue and disrupt business models.On Wednesday, Zuckerberg again apologized to lawmakers for failing to protect user privacy that led to the Cambridge Analytica debacle. But he didn't waver in offering a defense of the company's broader business model. He consistently defended its platform, strategy and monetization plans.""We believe Zuckerberg exceeded investor expectations,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients about the Tuesday testimony before a joint Senate committee hearing.

But he expressed confidence that Facebook, with artificial intelligence software tools, will be more effective in detecting and eliminating abuses on its platform.Sena maintained an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 230.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives in a research note also retained a positive view of Zuckerberg's performance. He maintained a rating of highly attractive, with a price target of 225.Ives said the hearings are more than about Zuckerberg and his company. They have ramifications for Alphabet and Twitter along with online advertisers worried about a new regulatory landscape on the horizon.""In our opinion, this is the most pivotal 48 hours of Zuckerberg's career and so far he is performing well above expectations, passing with flying colors on Day 1 of the hearings and the Street is showing a sigh of relief accordingly,"" Ives wrote. ""Zuckerberg looks confident and is a stark contrast to the fears this was going to be another 'Rocky' movie with a Congressional beating and Facebook/Zuckerberg waving the white towel.""As to the impact the data scandal will have on Facebook usage, a survey over the past few weeks by GBH suggests there will be some deceleration in activity.""We found that roughly 15% of Facebook users polled will decrease in some capacity their use of the platform in light of the Cambridge issue and we estimate a negligible number of users have deleted their Facebook accounts despite the backlash,"" Ives wrote.He estimated that in a worst-case scenario, between $1 billion to $2 billion of annual advertising — about 3% of total revenue — is at risk in 2018. That's based on slower user growth, reduced engagement, and softer advertising revenue with regulation the major variable.In one portion of Tuesday's testimony, Zuckerberg was asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who he thought was the main competitor to Facebook. Graham asked if the social network held a monopoly in its field.""It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,"" Zuckerberg said.To which Graham asked: ""If I don't like Facebook where can I go?"" He added: ""Is there an alternative in the private sector?""Zuckerberg replied there are a number of rivals who offer some of the same services as Facebook such as Twitter and Alphabet.One recently formed company wanting to take on Facebook is Vero.co, a subscription-based, ad free social network.In its promotional material, Vero says it's an alternative to Facebook and its Instagram platform, with more than 3 million members. Facebook has 2.1 billion users.""No amount of band-aids will fix Facebook's flawed model,"" said Ayman Hariri, co-founder and CEO of Vero in a statement emailed to IBD. ""Facebook has always been a data-mining machine posing as a social network. Their users are their product, making their data an unlimited resource subject to abuse.""Facebook shares, which jumped 4.5% Tuesday, were up another 1.6%, near 167.65 during afternoon trading on the stock market today.

But that was largely a repeat of prior promises.U.S. crude futures rose 8.6% to $67.39 a barrel for the week, reflecting tighter global supplies and rising Mideast tensions. Crude settled at its highest level since late 2014. President Trump tweeted that he would fire missiles at Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack, but later said it might not be ""soon."" The Energy Information Administration said weekly domestic crude oil inventories rose by 3.3 million, above analyst expectations. U.S. production increased to 10.53 million barrels per day up from 10.46 million bpd in the prior week. In its monthly report, OPEC raised its non-OPEC oil production guidance Thursday, as crude supplies from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and the U.K. grow.  But the IEA said it expects global stockpiles to fall below the five-year average in a ""month or two"" as inventories are seen falling by 600,000 barrels per day until the end of the year, a sign that OPEC and Russia are nearing the goal of their production cuts. Energy stocks were big winners, with several breaking out past buy points.Delta Air Lines (DAL) said higher fuel costs are a ""wild card"" for its 2018 profit outlook, but signaled global demand will offset that.

The deal could also spark some interest in takeovers of other gene therapy companies, analysts say.Walmart (WMT) appears to have the lead over Amazon (AMZN) in acquiring a controlling stake in Indian e-commerce heavyweight Flipkart, valuing the company at $20 billion. Bloomberg reported that Flipkart's board is leaning toward Walmart because of the likelihood that it could close the deal promptly and without regulatory pushback.

1046,CL,"Public Relations: After days of silence in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking up a storm. Given the kinds of things he's been saying, it might be better if he went back to his Silent Zuck routine.Case in point is his interview with Vox.com, in which Zuckerberg managed to generate a new round of bad press over Facebook's privacy scandal, talked about having some sort of Supreme Court decide what constitutes ""acceptable speech"" and how Facebook (FB) hampers independent media outlets. Oh, and he apparently thinks patriotism is arcane.The latest privacy flap came when Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook scans private messages sent over its Messenger app and blocks those it deems inappropriate.During the interview, he talked about blocking ""sensational messages"" that Facebook believed were meant to incite harm. ""Our systems detect that that's going on,"" he said. ""We stop those messages from going through.""On Wednesday, Facebook officials confirmed the practice to Bloomberg.The public response has not been favorable. One Twitter user commented ""Facebook is the new NSA."" Another tweeted ""Facebook: The world's youngest surveillance state.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen not talking about how Facebook is censoring private messages, Zuckerberg told Vox's Ezra Klein about how he wants Facebook to censor content its users share, by acting like a government and setting up an independent body to determine what was ""acceptable speech.""""You can imagine,"" he said, ""some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don't work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.""It's a good thing Zuckerberg wasn't around when the founders were drafting the First Amendment.But what exactly does he think would constitute global ""social norms and values"" in a world that includes countries where gays are executed, infidels killed, political opponents jailed, and free press suppressed?Zuckerberg also talked about how his company ""worked directly"" with the German government to monitor content before elections there, saying that ""if you work with the government in a country, they'll actually have a fuller understanding of what is going on.""That prompted the Wall Street Journal's James Freeman to write: ""The idea of Facebook working with governments around the world to filter news is more frightening than almost any commercial use of user data one can imagine.""We could not agree more.Zuckerberg then went on to explain how Facebook is tilting the playing field toward mainstream, liberal media outlets by boosting their ranking in its News Feed.""We've surveyed people across the whole community and asked them whether they trust different news sources,"" he said. Naturally, big-name news outlets made the list.Even Klein, a liberal, balked at this, saying he felt Facebook was creating ""a huge return to incumbency.""The right-wing Breitbart news site put it more succinctly, saying Facebook was working to ""crush new media.""When not making bad press for Facebook, Zuckerberg had other peculiar things to say.He talked about how the company has ""done a lot of research into what drives well-being for people."" Apparently, that research didn't turn up much, since researchers have found that social media use contributes to depression, and the latest IBD/TIPP poll finds that two-thirds think Facebook is harmful to society.At another point, Zuckerberg appears to dismiss pride of country as old fashioned.""One of the things I found heartening is if you ask millennials what they identify the most with, it's not their nationality,"" he said. ""The plurality identifies as a citizen of the world. And that, I think, reflects the values of where we need to go.""There is no doubt that Zuckerberg is a smart guy and savvy businessman. But maybe if he focused on things like protecting his users' privacy — the one issue that has galvanized the public — rather than ""We Are the World"" fantasies and ""acceptable speech"" codes, his company wouldn't be in so much trouble.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Did Facebook Break The Law To Help Obama Win In 2012?Facebook Privacy Scandal: Why Regulation Is Not The AnswerFacebook Crisis Deepens As Public Turns Against Social Network: IBD/TIPP Poll

1048,CL,"IBD 50 watchers, get ready. Here comes the Donald Trump profits bump.The number of companies posting Q1 results will bulge in the next few weeks. So too have the profit estimates.Steady economic growth in the U.S. and abroad serves as one factor. But don't forget that President Trump's $1.5 trillion tax system overhaul will show its impact on earnings for the first time this past quarter. It includes slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.Workers are benefiting from tax cuts. Will they spend more? One hint: In IBD's stock research tables, the Leisure sector ranked No. 5 among 33 in terms of mid- to long-term price performance.Planet Fitness (PLNT), one of the 10 stocks holding a spot in IBD Leaderboard, belongs to this sector.Planet Fitness and 28 other IBD 50 firms may post a minimum 40% increase in earnings per share in Q1. That's huge!The no-frills gym operator is expected to drive earnings up 42% in Q1 to 27 cents a share. This isn't some one-off result. In the prior eight quarters, Planet Fitness grew earnings by 15%, 31%, 167%, 233%, 27%, 29%, 19% and 20% vs. year-ago levels.In total, 36 of the IBD 50 firms are likely to post a 25% EPS increase. A 25% lift meets the C in CAN SLIM, IBD's seven-point  paradigm for smart growth investing.SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG): The Israeli solar power inverter firm is expected to push Q1 profits up 122% to 80 cents a share. A year ago, profit dropped 29% to 36 cents, so that helps boost this quarter's expected gain. According to Yahoo Finance, the consensus view features nine analysts' forecasts that range from 74 cents (up 105%) to 87 cents (up 142%).Micron Technology (MU): Earnings for May-ending fiscal Q3 are seen boosting 75% to $2.84 a share. The flash memory and image sensor giant has posted big profits for six quarters in a row. Annual numbers are highly cyclical.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND): The San Diego-based firm saw profits fall 10% in Q1 a year ago. This time, the Street sees a 102% jump, following gains of 91%, 57% and 77%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD): The Street sees earnings throttling 80% higher to 72 cents a share. In the prior four quarters, earnings rose 5%, slipped 2%, then rose 29% and 53%. The online broker merged with Scottrade last year.Call the S&P 500 profits picture bright. Equities research firm CFRA notes that S&P 500 firms are seen delivering 16% profit growth in the first quarter. The initial estimate on Jan. 1? Up 10.4%. Usually, analysts tend to trim earnings estimates in the months leading up to reporting season.Within the S&P 500, energy firms could post a 69% leap in earnings.CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell says the sluggish performance of the S&P 500 since January has benefited valuations. The forward P-E multiple dropped to 16.7 times earnings, in line with the historical average and below a 19.3 peak in late January.So, will large cap firms have a relatively easier time delivering blowout earnings in Q1 and gleaming outlooks for Q2 and beyond?Bell wrote in a Thursday client note she has seen ""limited reductions in (EPS) projections in the month ahead of the reporting period (and sizable increase since Jan. 1)."" She suggests corporate managers may give ""tempered Q2 guidance"" following a whipsawing stock market, tariff threats by both China and the U.S., and the possibility of a faster than expected ascent in interest rates. ""We still think EPS (for the S&P 500 firms) will end higher than the current 16.3% estimate, but the beat may be at the lower end of the historical range,"" she adds.On Friday, the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund sank as much as 2% but held on to a gain of more than 2% for the week.

1061,CL,"The poor stock market performance in March and the first quarter took its toll on many of the best mutual funds, according to IBD's latest Best Mutual Funds Performance Report. But mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD are not hitting the panic button yet. In fact, they point to a silver lining.""The pullback has taken some of the richness out of stock valuations,"" said Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal, co-manager of $2.8 billion Glenmede Large Cap Core Fund (GTLOX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Awards list. ""A drop in valuations is good,"" he added.Meanwhile, how weak was stock market performance? March's 2.54% setback marked the S&P 500's second straight monthly decline after 15 straight monthly gains. The bogey's 0.76% Q1 reversal was its first after nine straight quarterly advances. Likewise, the 0.93% March decline by the average U.S. diversified stock mutual fund was its second in a row after five monthly climbs. The group's 0.38% Q1 shrinkage was its first after seven quarterly gains in a row.Investors were jolted in part by fears of inflation, de Vassal said. That arose from January's strong payroll numbers — 200,000 jobs created instead of the 180,000 that were expected — and 2.9% rise in average hourly wages versus the prior year. Later downward revisions eased investors' concerns, but those jitters were replaced by new ones stemming from concerns about a possible trade war, sparked by U.S. tariffs on Chinese aluminum and steel, and the falloff by technology stocks.Still, many mutual fund managers look beyond the weak March and Q1 stock market performance and see encouraging signs. ""The economy looks good,"" said Chip Reed, co-manager of $11.6 billion Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund (EISMX), another 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. ""The market looks good. We have the tax stimulus package. We have global synchronized recovery in economic growth for the first time since the 1990s. It doesn't get better than this.""Despite U.S. diversified stock mutual funds' March fall, small-cap growth funds managed a 1.23% gain. That made them the best-performing subgroup. They also led Q1 overall by advancing 3.13%.And in contrast to the losses on average by U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in March and Q1, world equity funds eked out a 0.11% Q1 gain despite slipping 0.85% in March. Pacific ex Japan funds led world regions in March by posting the smallest setback, 0.35%. Latin American funds led foreign stock fund categories in Q1 with a 5.57% advance.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the weakest market moved sharply in the opposite direction. India region funds plunged 7.51% in Q1, trimming their five-year average annual gain to 11.90%, still best among foreign stock markets.Among major sectors, real estate funds topped the pack in March with a 3.36% gain. Global science/technology funds' 5.53% advance was tops in Q1.Precious metals funds did worst among sectors in Q1, plummeting 7.21%, despite gaining 1.93% in March amid jitters about inflation and a possible trade war.On average, taxable bond funds gained in March but lost ground in Q1. Tax-exempt bond funds as a group also rose in March but sank in Q1.Despite the macro factors fueling his constructive outlook, Eaton Vance's Reed added that a trade war and high valuations could disrupt the party. ""You need to be cautious,"" he said.Matthew Moberg, lead manager of $5 billion Franklin DynaTech (FKDNX), a third 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner, says investors should expect continued volatility for the rest of this year. Otherwise, he is constructive. ""A combination of tax reform and earnings increases is good,"" he said. ""And inflation is being held in check by large internet platforms.""Further, despite the recent tech stock sell-off, Moberg's tech-focused fund remains bullish on select tech names. ""The fund invests in innovation,"" Moberg said. ""Places where we are invested still have a lot of secular growth.""In cloud computing, Moberg likes the huge lead that Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have in a growing market. In mobile advertising, he says Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are growing and enjoying solid profitability.Three companies dominate chipmaking. He owns Intel (INTC) but not Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). In the payments arena, he cites secular growth by Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).In the software space, he likes ServiceNow (NOW). ""This company helps information-technology departments,"" Moberg said. ""Their software is finding new applications.""Reed looks for all-weather stocks. ""We look for holdings that can do well in any environment,"" he said. ""Our holdings tend to be companies that are somewhat immune to the economic cycle.""One is Verisk Analytics (VRSK). ""They sell data on insurance claims (mainly to property and casualty) insurance companies that they receive from other insurers,"" Reed said. ""They have a reservoir of information and tax records."" The company also has an insurance unit focused on risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power-generation, and metals and mining industries.Markel (MKL) is another Reed favorite. ""They're a specialty insurance company,"" he said. ""They don't compete with big insurers. They underwrite insurance for bars, day care centers. The risks are higher, but that enables them to demand higher premiums.""Reed also holds Blackbaud (BLKB), a cloud software company focused on nonprofits. ""They design software that helps nonprofits run their business, from the accounting side to the fundraising side.""Blackbaud's programs enable nonprofits to focus on core missions rather than allocate resources to developing their own software, Reed said. ""They are dominant in that industry, and they expanding into education,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeIn A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course With Your Mutual Funds?

1070,CL,"People can't agree on much in these highly charged partisan times. But one thing they do agree on in the wake of Facebook's privacy scandal: The social network is having a negative impact on society.That startling finding comes from the latest IBD/TIPP poll, which asked about Facebook (FB) in light of the scandal involving improper use of data on millions of the social network's users. Political consultant Cambridge Analytica is charged with the alleged infractions that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign. There also are reports of widespread access of Facebook data by the Obama campaign in 2012.Fully 66% of those surveyed by IBD/TIPP say Facebook's impact on society has been negative. Just 28% say it's been positive.Political ideology does not factor into the equation, with 63% of Democrats, 69% of Republicans and 69% of independents holding negative views about the company. Nor is there a difference among men and women — 66% of both groups say Facebook's hurting society. However, negative views rise with income, going from 58% among those with incomes under $30,000 to 70% for those with incomes over $75,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNot a single one of the 41 demographic or economic breakdowns thinks its impact on society has been positive, the IBD/TIPP poll found.Facebook's problems only begin there.The poll also found that of those who've been following the data privacy scandal story closely, fully 80% say they are concerned about the privacy of their information on Facebook. Just 19% say they aren't concerned.Democrats following the story closely are more concerned about their privacy, 85%, than Republicans or independents, 76%.What's more, half of those following the story closely say they are likely to decrease their use of Facebook as a result. Only 37% said they were unlikely to cut back.Women are more likely to say they plan to decrease usage than men — 53% vs. 47%. Suburban users also are more likely to cut back than city dwellers — 54% vs. 50%.Other polls have found similar grim results for the company. The liberal-leaning Public Policy Polling found just 30% of registered voters now have a favorable view of Facebook. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that it ranked last among six big tech companies on trust that they would obey privacy laws.Facebook stock has plunged 16% since March 16, when the story broke that Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign during the primaries, had apparently obtained personal information on millions of its users without their knowledge. Investor's Business Daily later reported that the company had granted the Obama campaign far wider access to its user database during Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, which might have been in violation of campaign finance laws.The company also faces congressional probes and increased calls for federal regulations.Meanwhile, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is in a battle of words with Apple CEO Tim Cook, after Cook blasted Facebook's business model. Zuckerberg said Cook's statement was ""extremely glib and not aligned with the truth.""Facebook's ability to weather this storm remains to be seen. But it does have one thing going for it: more than 2.1 billion active users worldwide.Methodology:  IBD/TIPP conducted the latest poll from March 22-29. It includes responses from 902 people nationwide, interviewed by live interviewers on cell or landline phones. The poll's margin of error is +/-3.3 percentage points. The questions about the impact of the Facebook scandal on privacy protections and usage went to 66% of respondents who say they've been following the scandal story closely.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Did FB Break The Law To Help Obama Win In 2012?Facebook Privacy Scandal: Why Regulation Is Not The AnswerFacebook-Apple Tussle Escalates As Zuckerberg Fires Back At Cook

It's now 4% below its 50-day moving average and 10% off its 52-week high.Given the market's volatility, most U.S. stock funds are testing support near their 200-day moving average.So it stands to reason that a commodity-based safe-haven play is faring better. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which tracks the price of gold, remains above its 50-day moving average. Shares may be forming a flat base with a potential buy point at 129.61.

Other news shaking up the market include Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), he notes, which could face close regulatory scrutiny.""Although U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, and China's proposed taxes on American goods, have not been imposed yet, markets are already beginning to price in the news,"" Holmes wrote. ""A trade war could be a concern sometime down the road, but I'm confident U.S. and Chinese officials can work together to avert a full-blown tit-for-tat standoff.""However, due to some early warnings sings of possible economic turbulence ahead, Holmes says: ""I would highly urge investors to ensure a portion of their portfolio is in a historically reliable store of value—investment-grade municipal bonds, for instance, and gold bullion and gold mining stocks.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Pare Gains As Apple Tests Support Again And Bitcoin DropsWill The Escalating U.S.-China Trade War Hurt Your Stock Funds?Could Blockchain Be A Bigger Disrupter Than The Internet?

1098,CL,"Shares in Time Warner (TWX) rose for the eighth straight trading day Thursday as investors apparently like AT&T's (T) chances of prevailing in an antitrust court fight against the government over a merger of the two.A federal judge overseeing the case on Wednesday made comments that some observers interpreted as a plus for AT&T. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon asked a government witness from Charter Communications (CHTR) whether AT&T's arbitration offer made to cable and satellite TV companies could be restructured to resolve concerns about the merger.The Department of Justice, which is seeking to block the acquisition, has stated that an arbitration process would be inadequate to address a combined AT&T-Time Warner's negotiating clout over programming distribution. The government, though, approved of Comcast's (CMCSA) acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 with arbitration included among the deal's conditions. Judge Leon also oversaw the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger approval process.Shares in Time Warner rose 0.5% to close at 96.39 on the stock market today.

According to Bill Studebaker of ROBO Global, ""we're definitely in a new world order.""""The FANG companies clearly were the past growth,"" Studebaker, the president and CIO of ROBO Global, told Investor's Business Daily at the Inside ETFs conference earlier this year. ""We think what we call RAAI — robotics, automation and artificial intelligence — is the future FANGs.""He added that the FANG companies are RAAI ""ambassadors,"" because they use AI, robotics and automation in many aspects of their businesses. This can be likened to investing in the picks and shovels during the gold rush, according to Studebaker. For example, Amazon and Google are using AI for their smart home devices. Amazon also uses robots in its warehouses.There are several robotics, automation and AI-focused ETF offerings in the market.

1101,CL,"President Trump's latest threat to double down on his China trade war would be so bad that it may actually be good news in disguise.Yet his proposal to slap tariffs on another $100 billion worth of Chinese imports could signify that Trump now recognizes a trade war won't be ""fun"" or ""easy to win.""The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all tumbled more than 2% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index undercut its 200-day line once again intraday, but closed above that key support.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump's late Thursday statement decried China's plan to retaliate with tariffs that match U.S. trade restrictions blow for blow. ""China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,"" Trump's statement read. In other words, China's strategy may be working.American farmers, and agricultural equipment makers like Deere & Co. (DE), may be among the biggest losers in a China trade war.Trump said that he's tasked the Department of Agriculture with working on ways ""to protect our farmers and agricultural interests."" That may be hard to do without an emergency congressional appropriation.Billions of dollars are at stake for U.S. farmers, with China imposing 25% tariffs on $14 billion worth of soybeans alone. Corn, cotton, tobacco and other crops also face tariffs. GOP lawmakers from farm states are said to worry about what Trump's trade war could do to their electoral prospects. At the least, Trump tariffs threaten to undermine the GOP's message about tax cuts finally unleashing economic growth.So it's not clear that Trump and the GOP are prepared for the fallout from China's retaliatory measures against the first $50 billion worth of Chinese imports he plans to target.Trump's 25% tariffs on high-tech imports won't take effect for at least a month. That will give businesses a chance to comment and negotiations to proceed. But the calm before any storm may last much longer if Trump wants protections in place for U.S. farmers.Further, the likelihood of Trump tariffs on up to another $100 billion worth of Chinese imports seems low. U.S. trade officials bent over backwards to avoid hitting Chinese imports that would harm American consumers. Nike shoes and Apple iPhones were left unscathed. Doubling down on tariffs without hitting consumers may not be possible.The takeaway for investors is that Trump's China trade war will likely be mostly talk for months to come. Further, Trump is probably discovering he has less leverage than he believed. As trade war costs hit home increasingly as Trump escalates, there's a good chance he will make a concerted effort at negotiation. While he'll hold out the threat of using a hammer, he doesn't have much of a hammer at his disposal.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Here's The Problem With The Stock Market RallyThis Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

But what exactly do we mean by ""heavy"" volume?Look for at least a 40% increase in turnover compared to the 10-week average to indicate that institutions may be shifting their mindset toward the stock.Every IBD weekly chart on Investors.com shows the 10-week moving average as a line draped across the weekly volume bars. Click on any volume bar to see the actual volume and the percentage change.That break — combined with other sell signals — can be a great time to lock in solid gains. However, it's never a certainty that the stock will continue to fall; many leading growth stocks will simply form a base and offer a new buy point. So keep track of that stock. Be prepared to buy that stock back if it breaks out again.It's also impossible to know how long or far the stock can fall before rebounding.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg is 33 and has a net worth north of $60 billion, making him the fifth richest person on Earth, according to Forbes. His company is also accused of allowing ""misuse"" of its users' personal data to help elect President Donald Trump. Never mind that the 2012 Obama campaign bragged about using Facebook in a similar way to win re-election. So, when it comes to Facebook and Zuckerberg, what's not to hate?Industrial pioneers and visionaries like John D. Rockefeller in oil and Andrew Carnegie in steel found themselves vilified in newspapers as ""robber barons,"" a label popularized by a New York Times writer. Never mind that the price for kerosene continued to fall even as Rockefeller dominated the industry, just as the price of steel continued to fall despite Carnegie's alleged greed.IBM (IBM) found itself under investigation by the Department of Justice in 1969 for antitrust violations. Those complaining about the company's alleged abuses were not consumers but competitors.

One could argue that IBM never fully recovered.Microsoft (MSFT) became a target of antitrust regulators at the DOJ in 2001 for the company's alleged illegal ""bundling.""

Guess he thinks nobody saw the movie ""The Social Network"" and the vicious big-money lawsuit he was involved in over who founded Facebook. Zuckerberg is a businessman.Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress to address accusations of ""violating the privacy"" of users' personal data. What privacy?

That's up 19%, based on the midpoint of its guidance.

1142,CL,"The next episode of President Donald Trump's China trade war has two possible storylines, Beijing signaled on Tuesday. Either the two sides negotiate a truce, or China will match Trump tariffs blow for blow. China stepped up its rhetoric Tuesday, with the Trump administration detailing China tariffs.""We will certainly take countermeasures of the same proportion and the same scale, same intensity,"" Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, said in a China Global Television Network interview.Despite the tough talk from China, the stock market staged a modest, up-and-down recovery on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index both rose more than 1% on the stock market today, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 1%. The Nasdaq led a broad-based sell-off Monday amid growing China trade war concerns and tech-stock weakness, with the S&P 500 undercutting its 200-day moving average.Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE), all Dow Jones components, are among the companies with the highest dollar-value exposure to China based on total sales. Apple climbed 1% Tuesday. Boeing rose 2.6%. Nike climbed 4%, reclaiming its 50-day line.So far, China's actions have met that standard of matching U.S. tariffs in scale. Over the weekend, Beijing detailed the $3 billion worth of U.S. products that will face tariffs in China. Those products include fresh and dried fruit, wine, pork, and certain steel products.Beijing didn't impose those tariffs in retaliation for the anti-China trade measures Trump announced on March 22, as Wall Street first thought.

1152,CL,"Leading stocks near buy points can be hard to find in the later stages of a stock market rally.But two IBD Stock Spotlight names, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and RingCentral (RNG), were less than 1% from buy points on the stock market today. Their circumstances showed some similarities, as well as some key differences.E-Trade Financial had pulled back to just below a 56.10 buy point in a six-week cup base. A number of the online broker's technical measures were in order: Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a healthy B+. Its Up/Down Volume ratio weighed in at a strong 1.6. Both measures indicate strong participation from institutional buyers.The stock's relative strength line held just below its Friday high – a sign of strength relative to the overall S&P 500.The base was technically a late-stage pattern, however.

Investors could have taken some profits starting at around 60. The follow-on opportunity provided by the three-weeks-tight entry is a good place to push some of that capital back in at a reduced-risk entry.Monday's weak-volume pullback was no cause for real concern. A drop all the way to the stock's 10-week line would undercut the 65.86 buy point by 7% to 8%, just a hair shy of triggering the automatic sell rule.Ring's relative strength line is in great shape, just a whisker off Friday's high. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a solid A-, and its Up/Down Volume Ration reads a powerful 1.9.The company's earnings are rising from low levels, so the percentage gains are big: triple-digit year-over-year percentage gains for the past 10 quarters.

1158,CL,"Leading stocks near buy points can be hard to find in the later stages of a stock market rally.But two IBD Stock Spotlight names, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and RingCentral (RNG), were less than 1% from buy points on the stock market today. Their circumstances showed some similarities, as well as some key differences.E-Trade Financial had pulled back to just below a 56.10 buy point in a six-week cup base. A number of the online broker's technical measures were in order: Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a healthy B+. Its Up/Down Volume ratio weighed in at a strong 1.6. Both measures indicate strong participation from institutional buyers.The stock's relative strength line held just below its Friday high – a sign of strength relative to the overall S&P 500.The base was technically a late-stage pattern, however. That means the breakout could carry some added risk. Investors adding to their positions will want to keep their limits on their sell rules tight.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseComputer software developer RingCentral eased 1.5% in soft trade Monday, leaving it 2% above a 65.85 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The stock is up 34% since its last breakout, from a flat base in mid-January. Investors could have taken some profits starting at around 60. The follow-on opportunity provided by the three-weeks-tight entry is a good place to push some of that capital back in at a reduced-risk entry.Monday's weak-volume pullback was no cause for real concern. A drop all the way to the stock's 10-week line would undercut the 65.86 buy point by 7% to 8%, just a hair shy of triggering the automatic sell rule.Ring's relative strength line is in great shape, just a whisker off Friday's high. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a solid A-, and its Up/Down Volume Ration reads a powerful 1.9.The company's earnings are rising from low levels, so the percentage gains are big: triple-digit year-over-year percentage gains for the past 10 quarters. EPS is expected to surge 300% to 12 cents in the first quarter. Revenue is projected to climb 30%.Ring's results have beaten analyst targets over the past four quarters by a range of 16.7% to 50%.RELATED:Small Caps Pace Orderly Session As Wall Street's Attention Turns To Fed

1171,CL,"Lululemon (LULU) shares perked up late Tuesday after the yogawear maker reported earnings and sales that topped analyst estimates.Estimates: Earnings per share to rise 27% to $1.27 on 15% revenue growth to $910 million, per Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales to grow 9.5%, by Consensus Metrix estimates.Results: EPS of $1.33 on net revenue of $928.8 million. Total comparable sales rose 12%, all better than expected.Outlook: For 2018, Lululemon management sees 44-46 cents in per-share profit on $612 million-$617 million, well above views for 40 cents earnings per share and $585 million in sales.Stock: Lululemon shares are up 7% late after falling 2% to close at 78.71 in the stock market today, slightly below their 50-day line after testing support at the key level for several weeks. If the after-hours gain holds, a jump from the 50-day line would refresh the follow-on buy area for the Leaderboard stock.The stock had largely moved sideways for three months after a steep run-up at the end of last year that was sparked by Lululemon earnings in the Q3 report.Nike (NKE), which said it turned the corner in its home market when reporting Q3 earnings last week, still dominates the athletic apparel space and Adidas (ADDYY) is popular with teens and millennials.But Piper Jaffray noted that smaller brands such as Puma, Skechers (SKX) and Lululemon drove category growth in North America in the second half of calendar year 2017.""While fashionable athleisure product remains popular, such as lululemon, Adidas, and Nike lifestyle, traditional athletic apparel continues to be pressured as consumers are already well supplied and have moved away from wearing it as casual wear with more comfortable, fashionable options now available,"" wrote B. Riley's Susan Anderson on March 15, citing the firm's athletic footwear and apparel survey.Lululemon earnings follow the departure of CEO Laurent Potdevin in February, but analysts have affirmed their confidence in the foundation of the company. Potdevin's exit was related to conduct that failed to meet the company's standards, though the cause reportedly involved a relationship with a subordinate and was not related to Lululemon's finances or operations. Chairman Glenn Murphy, a Gap vet, is now in charge until a new CEO is brought on board.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.""Reading between the lines, we believe the Board was aggressive and acted on the offense to address any potential questionable conduct issues,"" wrote Wolfe Research analyst Adrienne Yih on Feb. 6. ""We believe lululemon has one of the strongest brands in the activewear space and is not at jeopardy of a potential sales backlash.""But Jefferies' Randal Konik said the management turnover ""gives (him) some pause,"" given that Lululemon's creative director, Lee Holman, left at the end of 2017. Konik continues to be cautious of ""decelerating athleisure momentum, a margin recovery story where the low hanging fruit has already been picked, and tough compares.""Not long after the resignation, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, often a controversial figure himself, sold off 2.75 million shares for about $211 million, the first time he's shed stock since September 2014, according to Bloomberg. But the sale reportedly was unrelated to Potdevin's exit; Wilson told the outlet that he wanted to fund other business ventures.Long term, RBC Capital Markets' Brian Tunick reaffirmed in January his view that Lululemon is on track for its $4 billion sales target for 2020.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: These 6 Apparel Stocks Are Worth Window-ShoppingAdobe's Top 10 Retail Predictions For 2018Why Finish Line Takeover Is Good For Nike, Bad For Foot LockerWhy Nike Is 'Back In Business' In North America After Sales Slump

The companies made the announcement at the New York Automobile Show on Tuesday. Waymo will utilize Jaguar's I-Pace electric vehicles, the companies said.Alphabet spun off Waymo as a stand-alone company in late 2016.

1177,CL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 were little changed Wednesday morning ahead of an expected Fed rate hike this afternoon.The Dow Jones led a lackluster stock market rebound Tuesday following the Facebook (FB)-led sell-off  Monday, even as Facebook continued to slump. IBD 50 stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points Tuesday, joining fellow chip gear leaders ASML Holding (ASML) and Teradyne (TER). Recent memory-chip IPO Smart Global Holdings (SMH) also moved back into a buy zone.These chip stocks provide several reasons to be bullish for the stock market rally, which was downgraded to uptrend under pressure after Monday.S&P 500 index futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. So did Dow Jones futures. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.25%, with Facebook sliding again.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Fed rate hike is all but assured, so the focus will be on Federal Reserve policymakers' outlook for future moves. It will be Jerome Powell's first policy meeting as Fed chairman, with Powell holding a press conference following the 2 p.m. policy announcement.While investors should be cautious about making new purchases with the stock market rally under pressure, one reason to be hopeful is leading stocks setting up and breaking out. And as a practical matter, a stock market uptrend isn't that useful for active investors unless there are quality stocks in buy zones.All five chip stocks cited here have Composite Ratings above 95. Lam Research and Smart Global boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. ASML has a 98 CR, Applied Materials a 97 and Teradyne a 96. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary ratings, including on earnings and other key metrics. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 before making their big runs.Smart Global has a relative strength line in new high ground. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. An RS line hitting new highs ahead of or amid a breakout is a bullish sign. Teradyne and ASML also have RS lines at record highs, while Applied Materials and Lam Research are not far off.ASML shares edged down 0.1% to 212.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading, holding above a 208.68 buy point. Teradyne rose 0.6% to 48.99 vs. its cup-base entry point of 48.63. Applied Materials climbed 1.25% to 59.23, moving above its 58.83 buy point from a double-bottom pattern. Lam Research advanced 0.7% to 219.13, just above its 218.88 double-bottom entry. Smart Global vaulted 6.2% to 44.92, moving back above a 43.25 buy point and rising to the top of the 5% chase zone.Facebook has fallen more than 9% already this week, plunging through key support. It's a major component of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Also, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP) also fell at least in part in sympathy. But so far, despite Monday's sell-off in the major averages and Tuesday's tepid bounce, leading stocks haven't suffered too much damage.Not every stock market rally needs semiconductors playing a big role. But the chip sector is a big part of the overall market, especially the Nasdaq. And chips are in virtually every tech product, from smartphones to PCs to servers as well as automobiles and so many other products. So if chip stocks and companies are doing well, that likely bodes well for tech stocks and companies overall.In addition to the five chip stocks cited here, a number of semiconductor manufacturers are near buy zones.

1179,CL,"The European Union is set to propose a 3% tax on digital revenue this coming week, hitting U.S. tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The European Commission will propose a tax on digital revenue on March 21, according to several media outlets. That follows earlier reports over the past few months suggesting the EU's executive arm was planning some sort of digital tax. If true, that would raise trade tensions with the U.S. on the heels of President Donald Trump imposing steel and aluminum tariffs.The digital tax, falling on companies with global revenues of 750 million euros ($930 million) or more, would have three parts. It'll tax advertising revenues from the likes of Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Amazon. It'll tax the sale of digital data to third parties. It'll tax fees from ""intermediation services"" from online marketplaces in which users buy and sell goods and services directly but pay fees to the digital platform. That will include Airbnb, Uber, eBay (EBAY) and, via its third-party merchants, Amazon. It likely would cover Apple's revenue from its App Store.Online media and content creators, including Netflix (NFLX) , should be exempt.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBy targeting revenue vs. profit, the EU aims to prevent global tax giants from avoiding taxes.But taxing revenue would be especially painful for money-losing companies such as Uber or those with low margins such as Amazon.And the tax would fall primarily on U.S. tech and internet giants, something that will not go over well with America.""The U.S. firmly opposes proposals by any country to single out digital companies. Some of these companies are among the greatest contributors to U.S. job creation and economic growth,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a Friday statement before a meeting with Apple CEO Tim CookThe European Union, which has few large consumer internet companies, has been increasingly aggressive vs. U.S. tech giants. The EU recently imposed a big fine on Google over search results and ordered Apple to pay a big back-tax bill to Ireland.The European Commission's proposal would need approval from all 28 European Union countries, with low-tax havens such as Ireland likely to object. So the policy may never pass or face major revisions.However, the large European countries such as France and Germany could go ahead on their own, amounting to largely the same policy. The U.K. previously opposed a digital tax but has signaled it'll adopt a policy after leaving the EU.The European Commission will describe the 3% digital tax as an ""interim"" measure.

1180,CL,"Stocks got pummeled on virtually all corners of the market on Monday, but it's not at all clear if the market is ripe again for a new market correction. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) cut its early losses bullishly and Boeing (BA), which triggered a key sell signal on Wednesday for recent new shareholders, edged higher for a second straight session.The Nasdaq composite dropped the hardest among the major indexes, falling nearly 2%. At one point, the tech-driven index was down as much as 2.6%.But even at the intraday low of 7285, the Nasdaq actually stayed above its important 50-day moving average. The leading index, currently up nearly 6% year to date, also stands 4% below its March 13 peak of 7637.The Dow Jones industrial average, hurt by eight of its 30 components falling 2 points or more, sank 1.3%. The S&P 500 lost 1.4%. Defensive issues paced the upside, including gold mining and food names.Solar stocks also bucked the decline, and IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks a solid 32nd among 197 industry groups for six-month relative performance. While Canadian Solar (CSIQ) helped lead the way, rising more than 6% to 16.59 in heavy turnover on big Q4 results (earnings up 321% to $1.01 a share, revenue up 66% to $1.11 billion), the true leader in the group is IBD 50 name SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG).Boeing undercut its 50-day moving average deeply on Wednesday in big volume, a clear-cut signal that some institutions eagerly took profits after the aerospace giant's big run. However, on Friday it did not usher a second sell signal despite falling 6.8% for the week.The reason? Boeing saw heavy turnover last week, but it didn't rise more than 40% above the 10-week moving average. The Dow Jones industrial component also saw a little bit of lift off its lows for the week.IBD research has found that when a true market leader takes out its 10-week moving average in a big way and weekly volume screams more than 40% above average, it's usually a very reliable indicator that a greater correction is underway. So for those who do not have a large profit cushion, taking at least partial profits is a savvy portfolio-management move.The Dow utility average fell 0.8%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is around 2.85% ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rating that starts Tuesday.Megacap techs bore the brunt of the selling, as did large-cap and midcap names in the semiconductor, computer and telecom gear sectors. Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 3% to 1,100.07 in fast turnover and dove below its 50-day moving average for the second time in nearly three weeks.Alphabet still harbors a 9.3% gain since its October breakout from a constructive flat base with a 1,006.39 entry.Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), one of the four tech members of the Dow industrials, showed buying support at 50 as shares fell just 0.6% to 50.84 in quiet trade.Notice on an IBD chart or MarketSmith chart how Intel's relative strength line, painted in blue, has not given much ground after bolting higher in February.Plus, since Intel fell less than the S&P 500, expect to see a bump up in the RS line. This line compares a stock's day-to-day performance with the large-cap benchmark.Intel has recently staged solid profit growth, with earnings rising 21%, 4%, 22%, 22%, 26% and 37% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. The semiconductor giant, eager to become a force in self-driving cars and other new markets, has also posted modest to high single-digit revenue growth for nine quarters in a row.At this point, Intel shares are still well-extended in price after breaking out of a long saucer base at 36.80 back in mid-September. Watch for a potential new base to form or a fresh test of support at the 10-week moving average, visible only on a weekly chart.The stock earns an enviable 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 at IBD Stock Checkup, topped only by Microchip Tech (MCHP) and STMicroelectronics (STM). Both of these names sport a 96 Composite. Cypress Semiconductor (CY), also in the semiconductor manufacturing industry group, holds a 95 ranking.STMicroelectronics, one of the most exciting semiconductor firms based in Europe, dropped more than 1% on Monday, but volume shrank 45% below average.

1184,CL,"Users of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google who subscribe to newspapers will find articles from those publications appearing higher in their search results, part of the tech giant's efforts to help media companies find and retain paying readers, sources told Bloomberg Wednesday.Google also will begin sharing search data that show who's most likely to buy a subscription, said people familiar with the matter who asked to be anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Google executives plan to disclose specific details at an event in New York on March 20, the sources said. Google declined to comment.The moves could help publishers better target potential digital subscribers and keep the ones they've already got by highlighting stories from the outlets for which they're paying. The initiative marks the latest olive branch from Silicon Valley in its evolving relationship with media companies.Several publishers, including News Corp.'s (NWS) Wall Street Journal, the New York Times (NYT) and the Washington Post — the latter of which is owned by Amazon.com (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos — are focusing on getting readers to pay for their content as it becomes more difficult to support newsrooms with advertising revenue. Many have been pushing Google and social media outlet Facebook (FB) for new tools to drive subscriptions, arguing they should help support trusted journalism at a time when their platforms have been exploited to publish fake news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook recently made major changes to its News Feed algorithm that are expected to shrink publishers' online audiences. But it's helping publishers in other ways. In October, the company began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles, letting publishers process payments directly and keep all of the revenue. In February, Facebook announced a program to help metro papers build subscriptions.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, bought Texture, a digital magazine service, this week in what the company said was a sign that it's committed to supporting quality journalism.Last year, Google changed its ""First Click Free"" policy that led some media outlets with strict online paywalls to appear lower in search results. Now, instead of requiring publishers with paywalls to provide at least three free articles per day, media companies can decide how many articles to let Google users read without paying.While tech giants try to forge closer business ties with media outlets, the revenue flowing to publishers remains relatively small. Facebook and Google, which also owns YouTube, represent just 5% of publishers' total digital revenue, according to Digital Content Next, a trade group representing the Financial Times, Bloomberg News, New York Times and other publishers.Google's AMP program, which hosts articles on its servers instead of publishers' websites so they load faster, has won praise for helping drive more subscriptions, but ""revenue has been slow to build,"" the group said in a January report.Alphabet shares were up 1.4% near 1,156 in afternoon trades on the stock market today.

One stock that fits that bill is FCB Financial (FCB), which had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 79 to 82 Friday. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.IBD's unique RS Rating measures technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks matches up against the rest of the market. Over 100 years of market history reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an RS Rating of over 80 as they launch their biggest runs.See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksFCB Financial broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 57.30 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to take shape. Also keep in mind that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure.

1189,CL,"Stocks got pummeled on virtually all corners of the market on Monday, but it's not at all clear if the market is ripe again for a new market correction. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) cut its early losses bullishly and Boeing (BA), which triggered a key sell signal on Wednesday for recent new shareholders, edged higher for a second straight session.The Nasdaq composite dropped the hardest among the major indexes, falling nearly 2%. At one point, the tech-driven index was down as much as 2.6%.But even at the intraday low of 7285, the Nasdaq actually stayed above its important 50-day moving average. The leading index, currently up nearly 6% year to date, also stands 4% below its March 13 peak of 7637.The Dow Jones industrial average, hurt by eight of its 30 components falling 2 points or more, sank 1.3%. The S&P 500 lost 1.4%. Defensive issues paced the upside, including gold mining and food names.Solar stocks also bucked the decline, and IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks a solid 32nd among 197 industry groups for six-month relative performance. While Canadian Solar (CSIQ) helped lead the way, rising more than 6% to 16.59 in heavy turnover on big Q4 results (earnings up 321% to $1.01 a share, revenue up 66% to $1.11 billion), the true leader in the group is IBD 50 name SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG).Boeing undercut its 50-day moving average deeply on Wednesday in big volume, a clear-cut signal that some institutions eagerly took profits after the aerospace giant's big run. However, on Friday it did not usher a second sell signal despite falling 6.8% for the week.The reason? Boeing saw heavy turnover last week, but it didn't rise more than 40% above the 10-week moving average. The Dow Jones industrial component also saw a little bit of lift off its lows for the week.IBD research has found that when a true market leader takes out its 10-week moving average in a big way and weekly volume screams more than 40% above average, it's usually a very reliable indicator that a greater correction is underway. So for those who do not have a large profit cushion, taking at least partial profits is a savvy portfolio-management move.The Dow utility average fell 0.8%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is around 2.85% ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rating that starts Tuesday.Megacap techs bore the brunt of the selling, as did large-cap and midcap names in the semiconductor, computer and telecom gear sectors. Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 3% to 1,100.07 in fast turnover and dove below its 50-day moving average for the second time in nearly three weeks.Alphabet still harbors a 9.3% gain since its October breakout from a constructive flat base with a 1,006.39 entry.Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), one of the four tech members of the Dow industrials, showed buying support at 50 as shares fell just 0.6% to 50.84 in quiet trade.Notice on an IBD chart or MarketSmith chart how Intel's relative strength line, painted in blue, has not given much ground after bolting higher in February.Plus, since Intel fell less than the S&P 500, expect to see a bump up in the RS line.

1194,CL,"General Motors (GM) lacks significant near-term positive catalysts for its much-hyped autonomous car business, says a Goldman Sachs analyst. GM stock is likely to fall further as competition from Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo intensifies and industry pressures mount, Goldman said.Last November, GM said it would deploy self-driving cars for a ride-sharing business in 2019. But Waymo on Tuesday announced it will launch an autonomous-driving, ride-hailing service in Phoenix, Ariz., this year. Waymo also announced a Jaguar Land Rover tie-up as its robotaxi business moves toward commercialization.""Waymo has emerged as the early leader,"" wrote Goldman's David Tamberrino in a note to clients Wednesday. ""With that context, we believe the positivity that was baked into GM's stock around its Cruise Automation business unit should continue to see pressure.""GM stock began a big rally last August as the Detroit automaker started laying out its autonomous car strategy. Between Aug. 1 and Oct. 24, 2017, it ran up 35% after clearing a 36.73 cup-with-handle buy point.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTamberrino noted shares are now back near the 35 level, erasing gains from last year's rally. He cut his 12-month price target to 31, citing additional headwinds such as ""tenuous"" fundamentals in North America (where new vehicle sales have started to cool); downtime in trucks (as GM refreshes its profitable truck lineup); and declining profits in the hot-selling crossover utility segment (as off-lease models flood the market over the next few years).Waymo's lead over GM derives in part from more physical autonomously driven miles, Tamberrino said. Its autonomous cars have driven 5 million miles on public roads over 10 years, in 25 cities. Waymo also has logged billions more in simulated miles.Waymo began developing a truly driverless robotaxi service (i.e., one without a safety engineer behind the wheel) in Phoenix last October, he noted. Tamberrino contrasted this to GM, ""which is currently testing its autonomous vehicles with engineers to monitor disengagements."" That means a human safety driver has to take over manual control of the self-driving vehicle. So GM's targeted 2019 robotaxi launch assumes ""an exponential improvement curve"" for its autonomous car driving technology, he added.Autonomous car momentum has come to an abrupt halt for the industry. Uber Technologies and, separately, Nvidia (NVDA) halted self-driving tests this week. This comes after an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian. Tesla (TSLA), which uses Nvidia chips, faces a new federal probe over a fatal accident involving a Model X that could involve Tesla's Autopilot.Shares of GM rose 2.45% to close at 36.34 on the stock market today. Alphabet stock bounced 3.2%, moving back above its 200-day line. Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) advanced 2% and 2.9%, respectively. Nvidia rose 4.6%.

Facebook shares initially tumbled but rose modestly for the week.Amazon fell 4.4% Wednesday, undercutting its 50-day line, on a report that President Trump wants to ""go after"" the e-commerce giant.

Fellow FANG Netflix (NFLX) found support at its 50-day line.Shares of Lululemon (LULU) soared 12% to record highs for the week.

The annual inflation rate edged up to 1.6% from 1.5%, an 11-month high. Inflation is far below the Fed's 2% target, and there's enough doubt about corporate pricing power. So inflation will have to rise further to pressure Fed policymakers to hike rates more than three times this year.

Hopes for cheaper corn, wheat and other commodity prices lifted packaged food companies, while the prospect of cheaper soybeans, which are mostly used for animal feed, not human consumption, gave IBD's Food-Meat Products industry group a big boost.Hormel stock finished 4.8% higher on the stock market today, Kellogg (K) rose 2.5%, General Mills (GIS) 2.4%, Conagra Brands (CAG) 2.3% and Flowers Foods (FLO) 1.7%. The packaged food sector got slammed two weeks ago when General Mills cut its earnings outlook, citing higher input prices.Meanwhile, shares of Deere, which makes tractors, combines, harvesters and other agricultural equipment, closed down 3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But today, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities remains ""Market in correction,"" so breakouts are understandably few in number.Floor & Decor (FND) is one of the rare big movers today, rising more than 5% to 55.06 in heavy volume.The flooring products retailer, which imitates Home Depot's large warehouse-style model, is now extended more than 5% past a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup-style base. It's best to buy a stock no more than 5% past the proper buy point; buying too high in price can subject an investor to a quick loss if the stock makes a temporary pullback to or even mildly below the breakout entry.Floor & Decor, now a mid-cap stock with a market value of $5.3 billion, went public in April 2017 at 21 a share. It has a float of 84 million shares and currently ranks No. 22 within the IBD 50. The company has grown earnings per share 9%, 75%, 47%, 31% and 58% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Sales jumped 25%, 31%, 29%, 27% and 40% over the same time frame.Going back to Tesla, the San Francisco-based firm still trades well below its 52-week peak of 389.61. Plus, the electric vehicle pioneer trades sharply below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. So the stock is nowhere close to a new IBD-style buy point.However, those who bought at the initial April 2013 breakout near 40 still hold a fantastic long-term gain.At this point, it makes sense to wait and watch for the possibility of heavy institutional buying to return. Trading near 280, Tesla is still an institutional favorite. The stock reached a total 1,000 mutual fund and hedge fund holders for the first time during the second quarter of 2016.That sponsorship has grown a bit more to 1,027 funds as of the first quarter of this year. In Q3 of 2017, that number reached 1,095 funds owning a total 54.4 million shares. Earlier this week, Tesla reported confidence in its goal to reach a significantly higher production rate of its Model 3 sedan within the next three months and said it has no plans to raise more capital via debt or equity offerings this year.The company said it built 2,020 Model 3 sedans in the final seven days of March and expects to see that run rate climb rapidly through the second quarter of this year.Tesla is racing to meet the mountain of 500,000 preorders made for the affordable all-electric four-door vehicle. The base price of the Model 3 is $35,000, but many new buyers are likely to add options.Elsewhere, homebuilding-related stocks advanced sharply following a blistering quarterly report from giant Lennar (LEN). The stock rose more than 8% to 61.97 and leapt back above the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than eight weeks.The Miami-based builder posted a sharp increase in earnings for the February-ended fiscal first quarter on a 28% jump in sales to $2.98 billion.LGI Homes (LGIH), a member of the IBD 50, ramped up more than 6% to 70.15 in below average trade. The stock continues to work on the right side of a cup-style pattern. The small cap rose 161% in 2017.Analysts see Q1 earnings rising 37% to 71 cents a share. LGI, which focuses on entry-level homes, grew its profits by 39% to $4.73 a share in 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on growth stocks, new breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: How Should You Handle Boeing Now? How Are The Best Growth Stocks Doing?

As a direct listing, its opening public price was determined by orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers.Shares ended their first regular session at 149.01,up nearly 13% from the reference price of 132.

1211,CL,"General Motors (GM) lacks significant near-term positive catalysts for its much-hyped autonomous car business, says a Goldman Sachs analyst. GM stock is likely to fall further as competition from Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo intensifies and industry pressures mount, Goldman said.Last November, GM said it would deploy self-driving cars for a ride-sharing business in 2019. But Waymo on Tuesday announced it will launch an autonomous-driving, ride-hailing service in Phoenix, Ariz., this year. Waymo also announced a Jaguar Land Rover tie-up as its robotaxi business moves toward commercialization.""Waymo has emerged as the early leader,"" wrote Goldman's David Tamberrino in a note to clients Wednesday. ""With that context, we believe the positivity that was baked into GM's stock around its Cruise Automation business unit should continue to see pressure.""GM stock began a big rally last August as the Detroit automaker started laying out its autonomous car strategy. Between Aug. 1 and Oct. 24, 2017, it ran up 35% after clearing a 36.73 cup-with-handle buy point.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTamberrino noted shares are now back near the 35 level, erasing gains from last year's rally. He cut his 12-month price target to 31, citing additional headwinds such as ""tenuous"" fundamentals in North America (where new vehicle sales have started to cool); downtime in trucks (as GM refreshes its profitable truck lineup); and declining profits in the hot-selling crossover utility segment (as off-lease models flood the market over the next few years).Waymo's lead over GM derives in part from more physical autonomously driven miles, Tamberrino said. Its autonomous cars have driven 5 million miles on public roads over 10 years, in 25 cities. Waymo also has logged billions more in simulated miles.Waymo began developing a truly driverless robotaxi service (i.e., one without a safety engineer behind the wheel) in Phoenix last October, he noted. Tamberrino contrasted this to GM, ""which is currently testing its autonomous vehicles with engineers to monitor disengagements."" That means a human safety driver has to take over manual control of the self-driving vehicle. So GM's targeted 2019 robotaxi launch assumes ""an exponential improvement curve"" for its autonomous car driving technology, he added.Autonomous car momentum has come to an abrupt halt for the industry. Uber Technologies and, separately, Nvidia (NVDA) halted self-driving tests this week. This comes after an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian. Tesla (TSLA), which uses Nvidia chips, faces a new federal probe over a fatal accident involving a Model X that could involve Tesla's Autopilot.Shares of GM rose 2.45% to close at 36.34 on the stock market today. Alphabet stock bounced 3.2%, moving back above its 200-day line. Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) advanced 2% and 2.9%, respectively. Nvidia rose 4.6%. The embattled Tesla rose 3.2% after setting a fresh 52-week low intraday.Waymo ordered ""thousands"" more specially equipped Chrysler minivans in January, expanding a partnership.

Cambridge Analytica, a data mining and analysis firm, was employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.""I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,"" Zuckerberg wrote.

Further, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in a Twitter post announced that a Facebook investigation will be launched.Whether the steps Facebook plans to take will lift the cloud hanging over the company is not yet known.With the heat on Zuckerberg, might he relinquish his title as chief executive, but hold on to his title as chairman?Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities, said that's highly unlikely.""Anything can happen, but I do not believe that this will take place,"" Seyrafi told Investor's Business Daily. ""It would look too much like he is succumbing to pressure, and I don't sense that that's his style.""Facebook stock, which was up 2% early Wednesday, closed at 169.39, up 0.7% on the stock market today. That reversed two days of deep slides in the price of its shares. In after-hours trading Facebook shares were holding at 169.39.Facebook shares plunged to a seven-month low before recovering somewhat Tuesday.

On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into the Facebook data scandal that has roiled the company and its stock.Facebook stock was down 2.4%, near 155.60 during afternoon trading on the stock market today. Earlier in the day Facebook shares were down 6.5%. hitting an 8-month low.But last week's data breach wasn't the beginning of the stock's troubles, suggesting a deeper issue than just the mishandling of consumer information. Indeed, with failed breakouts and its relative strength line lagging, Facebook has been stripped of its leadership status. The RS line is at its lowest levels since early July 2017.The first sign of possible trouble arose in August, when Facebook stopped outperforming the S&P 500 and could only match the benchmark's performance, as indicated by its flat relative price strength line in the stock chart below. By November its RS line started to trend lower, meaning it was underperforming the broad market, a clear caution flag.As the new year started, Facebook shares attempted a breakout but the RS line did not hit a new high with the stock, another warning signal of further weakness.That breakout attempt failed decisively a month later. Facebook flashed its first sell signal on Feb. 9 when shares closed decisively below the 10-week moving average on elevated volume. The second attempt came last Monday, when the data scandal sent shares reeling by nearly 7% as the stock gapped below its 50-day moving average in huge volume.Shares then dropped more than 2% on Tuesday, plunging below their 200-day line, where they have remained since. The stock closed the week below its 40-week moving average (roughly analogous to the 200-day) in the heaviest down volume in more than four years, a third sell signal.Long-term Facebook investors with deep profit cushions can afford to sit through what could be a prolonged base-building period if they are still confident in the company's underlying growth story. Anyone who opened a position since August is underwater. Growth investors should never let losses grow beyond 8%. Selling is the best strategy as you look for better opportunities to grow your capital.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Cambridge Analytica scandal has presented Facebook shares with their worst week since July 2012, two months after the company's May 2012 initial public offering. Despite a 53% gain in 2017, the stock — now broken down below critical levels of support — is down 20% off its record high of 195.32 set on Feb. 1.Analysts have been mostly steadfast in insisting Facebook continues to be a buying opportunity despite the data scandal with Cambridge Analytica that erupted on Saturday. Reports from UBS, Cowen, RBC and others on Thursday followed other reports this week that reaffirmed what essentially are buy ratings on Facebook.More recent reports also had positive comments on the interview performance of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on CNN Wednesday evening, preceded by his first public comments on the Facebook data breakdown.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, it is worrisome that the left side of the base consists of just one week — a week in which the stock plunged about 26% off its all-time high price of 38.25 in massive turnover. The company likely faced excessively high expectations even as it beat the Street's targets in its Feb. 8 earnings release.After the 26% correction, the stock is forming the right side of a potential cup-shaped base with a 38.35 buy point.Another concern is the lack of upside volume on the stock's rebound. Ideally, the stock should fall in light volume, while recovering in heavy volume to indicate strong institutional demand.Also, be on the lookout for a new handle to form that would lower the risk-optimal entry from 38.35.As a result, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a slightly favorable C+ — according to IBD Stock Checkup. Look for that to improve as the stock finishes out the right side of its basing process.Meanwhile, Canada Goose stock boasts a 98 out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating.

The Nasdaq 100 reversed from session highs to fall nearly 3.7%.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, generally a lagging market index, resisted the stock market sell-off for much of the session, but was down more than 1.5% heading into the close. Defensive Dow Jones plays Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rose modestly.Worries over the future of self-driving technology efforts in the wake of a fatality during a recent Uber driving test in Arizona appear to be sparking some of the sell-off across the tech sector.The automaker group fell the most among IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, down 7.2%. Tesla (TSLA) paced the decline, dropping more than 8% in volume running 130% above usual levels.

Visa, falling nearly 3% to 117.40 in average trade, has been unable to rebound sharply since it sliced through the 50-day moving average on Thursday for the second time this month.Notice on a daily chart how on March 2, the first time the credit card and debit card payment processor undercut the 50-day line, Visa managed to bounce off its lows and finish mildly above that key support-and-resistance level.

But since then, the stock has not given up a whole lot of ground.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, it is worrisome that the left side of the base consists of just one week — a week in which the stock plunged about 26% off its all-time high price of 38.25 in massive turnover. The company likely faced excessively high expectations even as it beat the Street's targets in its Feb. 8 earnings release.After the 26% correction, the stock is forming the right side of a potential cup-shaped base with a 38.35 buy point.Another concern is the lack of upside volume on the stock's rebound. Ideally, the stock should fall in light volume, while recovering in heavy volume to indicate strong institutional demand.Also, be on the lookout for a new handle to form that would lower the risk-optimal entry from 38.35.As a result, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a slightly favorable C+ — according to IBD Stock Checkup. Look for that to improve as the stock finishes out the right side of its basing process.Meanwhile, Canada Goose stock boasts a 98 out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics designed to gauge a stock's leadership qualities.Lastly, the stock's relative strength line — the line painted in blue on every daily and weekly MarketSmith and IBD chart — has yet to reach a new high.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Federal Trade Commission on Monday confirmed it has opened an investigation into the data scandal.

That's down from a previous price target last week of 265. Post maintained a buy rating.Regarding the FTC investigation, ""It raises the risk of civil penalties on data privacy violations, and if history serves, could take multiple years to resolve,"" Post wrote in a research note to clients Tuesday. ""We believe the key questions at hand are: was Facebook transparent in data usage; and did Facebook properly notify users of policy violations.""Facebook stock plunged 4.9% to close at 152.22 on the stock market today. Shares are down 20% since reports of the Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged last week.Post is also concerned users will leave the social media platform because of rising negative sentiment.On Sunday, the company took out full-page ads in nine newspapers in the U.S. and the U.K., with CEO Zuckerberg apologizing for ""a breach of trust.""

He cited concerns that usage could be moderating, and the potential for advertisers to hold back on spending. But Sebastian maintained an outperform rating on Facebook.

1271,CL,"Many on Wall Street are wondering if the once-leading FANG stocks –Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) – are out of favor. Given these top tech stocks' outsized influence on the S&P 500, there could be cause for investor concern.The FANG stocks, which some have expanded to ""FAANG"" to include Apple (AAPL), were hit hard this week. Negative headlines continued to swirl around Facebook and Amazon, leading the tech sector lower.Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at Exponential ETFs, has even gone so far as to say that the FANG/FAANG trade is dead – for good.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I don't know that the individual companies are dead, but I think the collective behavior where all the companies themselves were going to behave in a similar manner, that's a thing of the past,"" Quigg told Investor's Business Daily via Skype.""Collectively putting them together and assuming you're going to get 20-plus percent returns per annum is not sustainable over the long term.""Quigg also noted that the tech-heavy influence in the S&P 500 is cause for investor concern.""The FAANG names plus Microsoft (MSFT) are 28% of the S&P 500. Apple is equal to the bottom 106 companies of the S&P 500. . .  their outsized influence in the markets is starting to play out,"" Quigg said.""The time to think of FAANG as an individual company or a trade is over.

The warning signs for Facebook appeared before the recent data scandal. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, was already lagging for several months.Amazon stock was looking more resilient compared with other FANG stocks. But a report that President Trump is looking to crack down on Amazon sent the stock tumbling below the key 50-day line in heavy volume Wednesday. While shares reversed higher Thursday, the 50-day line could now prove to be a new resistance level for the e-commerce giant.Netflix stock is holding up the best among its FANG peers. The stock reversed higher Thursday to rebound off of support at the 50-day line. This is the first rebound from the 50-day after Netflix's January breakout, meaning it's a secondary buying opportunity. But the current market environment warrants being careful about making new buys.Google stock retook its 200-day line on Friday, a good first step. But it's not clear yet if that can provide true support for the stock. Alphabet is now over 150 bucks below its all-time high of 1,198 on Jan. 29.

1278,CL,"Users of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google who subscribe to newspapers will find articles from those publications appearing higher in their search results, part of the tech giant's efforts to help media companies find and retain paying readers, sources told Bloomberg Wednesday.Google also will begin sharing search data that show who's most likely to buy a subscription, said people familiar with the matter who asked to be anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Google executives plan to disclose specific details at an event in New York on March 20, the sources said. Google declined to comment.The moves could help publishers better target potential digital subscribers and keep the ones they've already got by highlighting stories from the outlets for which they're paying. The initiative marks the latest olive branch from Silicon Valley in its evolving relationship with media companies.Several publishers, including News Corp.'s (NWS) Wall Street Journal, the New York Times (NYT) and the Washington Post — the latter of which is owned by Amazon.com (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos — are focusing on getting readers to pay for their content as it becomes more difficult to support newsrooms with advertising revenue.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook recently made major changes to its News Feed algorithm that are expected to shrink publishers' online audiences. But it's helping publishers in other ways. In October, the company began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles, letting publishers process payments directly and keep all of the revenue. In February, Facebook announced a program to help metro papers build subscriptions.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, bought Texture, a digital magazine service, this week in what the company said was a sign that it's committed to supporting quality journalism.Last year, Google changed its ""First Click Free"" policy that led some media outlets with strict online paywalls to appear lower in search results. Now, instead of requiring publishers with paywalls to provide at least three free articles per day, media companies can decide how many articles to let Google users read without paying.While tech giants try to forge closer business ties with media outlets, the revenue flowing to publishers remains relatively small. Facebook and Google, which also owns YouTube, represent just 5% of publishers' total digital revenue, according to Digital Content Next, a trade group representing the Financial Times, Bloomberg News, New York Times and other publishers.Google's AMP program, which hosts articles on its servers instead of publishers' websites so they load faster, has won praise for helping drive more subscriptions, but ""revenue has been slow to build,"" the group said in a January report.Alphabet shares were up 1.4% near 1,156 in afternoon trades on the stock market today.

1283,CL,"Amazon (AMZN) received a price-target hike Tuesday on a view that revenue from its advertising business is in the early stages of growth with plenty of opportunities ahead, and that the e-commerce behemoth could become a $1 trillion empire in coming years.X Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a buy rating and raised his price target on Amazon to 1,850 from 1,750, a 15% premium from where the stock currently trades. Thill expects Amazon's ad business to show a five-year compound annual growth rate of 40%, reaching $22 billion in 2022, compared with about $4 billion last year.The $22 billion in sales, he estimates, will represent less than 5% of total company revenue. But the ad business has the opportunity for Amazon to develop stronger relationships with brand advertisers. The business also has a high profit margin.""Amazon's billions of touch points with the consumer have allowed it to optimize its supply chain, now they are applying this same data to help advertisers optimize (spending) for both a brand and conversion basis,"" Thill wrote in a research note to clients.Thill also said: ""Adding it all up, we think the right pieces are in place for Amazon to get to $1 trillion in market cap over time.""Amazon shares dropped 0.6% to close at 1,588.18 on the stock market today, but shares touched a record high for the sixth straight trading day, reaching 1,616.95 at one point during the session. Amazon holds an IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of a possible 99 and is on the exclusive list of IBD Leaderboard stocks.Advertisers continue to shift dollars from offline to online and are focusing on publishers that have highly relevant and fresh data. Thill said Facebook (FB), Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon are each leaders in this category and will continue to garner greater share of the overall shift of ad dollars online. Alphabet and Facebook combined receive more than 60% of digital advertising.""We do not believe that Amazon's advertising business is coming at the expense of Alphabet and Facebook near term,"" Thill wrote.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportFacebook shares were down 0.2%, near 184.40.

1284,CL,"Is the IBD 50 trade war-resistant? Judging by the current composition of the list, one could argue, ""Yes, reasonably so.""More than a week after President Trump signed off on a 25% tariff on steel imports from most countries and a 10% hike in aluminum on March 8, the major indexes have taken it in stride. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are up since that day's close. The Nasdaq holds a nice cushion above its 50-day moving average.However, angst over the consequences of the protectionist trade strategy still hangs over the bull market. Will China and Europe retaliate? Which sectors could suffer the most if countries engage in tit-for-tat measures? Will the Scots and Brits really stop drinking Kentucky bourbon if prices skyrocket in the U.K.?No one knows. But in the IBD 50, very few of the companies making the list at the end of Thursday sell a commodity. Such physical goods appear to have a higher risk of getting punished by quotas or tariffs imposed by other countries. Warrior Met Coal (HCC) is the sole coal play in the list and sells in U.S., European, Latin American and Asian markets.In a November release on Q3 results, management expressed confidence it will remain a top exporter of high-quality metallurgical coal for the steel industry.""Strong sales volume coupled with high price realization and an exceptionally low cost structure enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow conversion,"" CEO Walt Scheller said in the release. The firm posted an average selling price of $144.06 per short ton; cash cost of sales rose $7.65, nearly 9%, vs. Q2 to $89.91.Warrior Met shares are trying to rebound off the 10-week moving average for the second time in as many months.The bulk of the IBD 50 firms are in finance, semiconductors and software. Software firms don't deliver their goods on ships or airfreight much these days. And companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and MKS Instruments (MKSI) sell products that enjoy incredible demand.The global era of consumer spending and investment is still going strong. Mastercard (MA) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) are delivering steady growth. The former has posted profit growth of 29%, 15%, 24% and 33% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The latter is expected to boost its earnings 33% this year to $4.55 a share.Trump clearly cares about working class families that rely on a strong manufacturing and industrial base. That's good. But the U.S. economy is truly diversified. The savvy IBD reader recognizes that entrepreneurs deliver innovative new products and services that span a wide swath of industries.Take Casa Systems (CASA). The Andover, Mass., company is the only one in the IBD 50 hailing from the telecom infrastructure industry group. Only six companies in the 26-member group trade at least 30 a share. Its software is a big hit with cable firms expanding their broadband service. Around 40% of its sales come from outside the U.S.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) are delivering excellent products to meet the enormous demand for data security, digital marketing campaigns, video design and editing and document management.Weibo (WB) is virtually 100% unlikely to be impacted by U.S. tariffs, both present and future. The Chinese social media giant has climbed 141% from a breakout at 58.89 in May 2017, but the stock's long-term uptrend remains intact. Wall Street sees Weibo's earnings soaring 56% to $2.81 a share this year and 43% in 2019.You can trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

It is instead more prudent to let the stock settle down and form a proper IPO base, which can be shorter than other consolidations, or other bullish patterns.Meanwhile, PagSeguro Digital (PAGS), Casa Systems (CASA) and Okta (OKTA), are well extended from recent breakouts. All came public in the past year. PagSeguro, Casa Systems and Okta all reported earnings last week. PagSeguro pulled back Tuesday, while Casa and Okta rose modestly in the stock market today.Another recent IPO that drew much attention is online personal styling service Stitch Fix (SFIX).

But Evoqua sank 7% to 23.43 Tuesday.Following its $500 million IPO in November, the stock price rocketed from its initial price of 18 up to a peak of 25.04 on January 24. It then went into a base building period for just over six weeks, and gapped-up Monday as it broke out of its cup-without-handle base and entered a new buy zone.

It is soaring above its 50-day moving average lineWhile the potential for a move is there, it is also worth bearing in mind it has risen on low volume.

It built its initial base space for 15 days before going on a run that saw it enter its profit zone on Monday, which is usually a good time for investors to take some of their gains.

But its resurgence in the U.S. in recent years, once built on the back of retro classics like the Superstar and popular newer lines like the NMD, is now powered by a ""balanced product portfolio,"" Adidas North America Brand President Mark King told Investor's Business Daily.""A year ago it was primarily Originals driving the success, and although Originals still had a great year in '17 and is still doing well, our training apparel — primarily or specifically with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) — is really growing at a very rapid rate, and that's a big opportunity for us,"" he said, adding that Adidas has also ""about tripled"" its market share in running over the last three years.On Tuesday, Dick's topped profit estimates but disappointed on sales and comps with its Q4 report.But Adidas' top growth driver is the entry-level ""core footwear"" category, which includes styles like Cloudfoam and is sold at stores such as Kohl's (KSS), DSW (DSW) and Famous Footwear.""We were really nonexistent there a few years ago,"" he said. ""(But) it's probably our fastest-growing category right now, and it's a massive category.""But fulfillment of online orders continues to challenge Adidas in North America, Cowen analyst John Kernan noted Wednesday, though distribution expansion will help drive growth in the U.S.""We heard several times from (management) on its Q4:17 earnings call that they believe the brand remains under-distributed in N.

1295,CL,"Germany-based package deliverer DHL has introduced a new e-commerce delivery service that will become available across at least seven U.S. cities this year, a move that comes as Amazon (AMZN), UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and an array of transportation-logistics companies battle to bring a growing number of items to customers' doorsteps.The service, called Parcel Metro, would have contractors making same-day or next-day deliveries for online retailers and fulfillment centers, as described Reuters, which first reported the news.Parcel Metro is currently available in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, and the company plans to launch the service in Dallas and Atlanta during the second quarter, with availability in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., later this year, DHL said in a statement on Thursday.Other cities internationally could be added to that roster, Reuters said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Amazon dipped 0.7%.DHL, along with UPS and FedEx, have been trying to improve their delivery networks to hasten the flow of packages from online retailers to customers' homes. UPS last month reported quarterly results that topped estimates, but a glut of holiday package volume brought extra operating costs for the company.But Amazon, which analysts suspect will try to handle more transportation and logistical matters itself, has been doing the same. The company reportedly plans to develop its own package delivery service, and plans to build an air cargo hub in Kentucky for its Prime Air Fleet.Meanwhile, logistics providers like XPO Logistics (XPO) and Echo Logistics (ECHO) have moved to digitize the services they offer to connect businesses that need products shipped and the companies that ship them.XPO Logistics rose 0.6% intraday, while Echo lost 1.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Does FedEx Have A 'Secret Deal' With The Firearms Industry?Home Depot Reportedly Mulled Bid For Logistics Firm To Fend Off AmazonXPO Logistics Joins Rank Of Stocks With 95-Plus Composite Rating

1300,CL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were mixed Thursday morning after China trade-war fears hit stocks on Wednesday.Alibaba (BABA) archrival Tencent (TCEHY), Visa (V) and AbbVie (ABBV) are all setting up in cup bases. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) stock is struggling with three technical challenges as Elon Musk faces an executive exodus and fresh manufacturing concerns.S&P 500 index futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.2% below fair value.Tencent, Visa and AbbVie all peaked on Jan. 26. They all sold off into early February, then rebounded strongly, pulling back modestly at the end of last month but holding support around the 50-day moving average. That mimics the action of the major averages, which all peaked on Jan. 26 before entering a fierce, brief correction.Since then Tencent, AbbVie and Visa have looked like a combination of the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite. Like the Nasdaq, the stocks found support at the 50-day line. Like the S&P 500, which is now above its 50-day, the stocks haven't hit new highs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That's why it's critical to follow the actions of the major averages and leading stocks. Reading the Stock Market Today columns and The Big Picture every day will keep you in sync with the market.Visa, Tencent and AbbVie are all in cup-with-handle bases. Technically, they are two days short of the seven-week minimum for a cup-with-handle pattern. Cup-without-handle bases are valid at six weeks. So if the stocks clear these handles on Thursday or Friday, there is a slightly added risk.In any case, Dow Jones component Visa has a 125.40 handle buy point, settling Wednesday at 122.58.AbbVie, closing Wednesday at 188.94, has a 122.10 handle entry.Tencent has a 59.54 handle buy point and closed Wednesday at 58.65.Alibaba, Tencent's rival for Chinese internet dominance, has a similar chart pattern at first glance. But the midpoint of its handle is below the midpoint of the base, so Alibaba is in a cup-without-handle base with a 206.30 entry.Tesla fell 4.45% to 326.63 in Wednesday trading. The stock tumbled through two support lines, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Meanwhile, Tesla's relative strength line is near recent lows. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been gradually declining since last June.Tesla has struggled with Model 3 production levels, slashing output goals several times in the last several months.

Tesla employees told CNBC that  the company is making a high level of faulty parts, requiring costly, time-consuming fixes.Meanwhile, two top Tesla finance executives have left in the past week after the global sales and services president exited in February.

Aggressive investors could treat 125.40 as an early entry point. (Even if you considered the consolidation a shallow cup base, it would have a proper handle because a cup-with-handle base must be at least seven weeks long, and Visa's pattern is just six weeks.)PayPal, another payment stock like Visa, slipped 0.1% to 80.60, near an 82.27 cup-with-handle buy point.Electronic Arts retreated 0.3% to 128.12.

The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% during the first hour of trading, slumped 0.5% right before lunchtime in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 0.7% after the open, edged slightly lower.Alphabet (GOOGL) helped lead the pullback, falling more than 1% to 1,153.

JPMorgan Chase reportedly cast doubt on the viability of GE's already reduced cash dividend. The industrial powerhouse is slated to pay shareholders 12 cents a share on April 25 to holders of record Feb. 26. That gives GE an annualized yield of 3.3%, vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500.GE holds a 3 Relative Price Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, meaning it's outperformed just 3% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The large-cap S&P 500 let gains of 0.4% slip to a 0.1% loss near lunchtime on Wall Street after finishing 0.1% lower on Monday.

1305,CL,"After a strong rebound since March 2, the stock market took a rest on Tuesday. The major indexes took losses of 0.6% to 1% in heavier turnover vs. Monday. Several top-rated stocks, meanwhile, continue to hold above or close to recent buy points.While Broadcom (AVGO) is receiving tons of media attention on news that President Trump ordered to block a potential megamerger with Qualcomm (QCOM), industry-mate Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has quietly broken out of a 15-week double-bottom base that features a 124.54 buy point.In a good double bottom, the second sell-off must undercut the first initial decline. Monolithic certainly did that: The base's second low of 103.14 went below the first low of 105.01.The stock found solid support at the 200-day moving average, and the base features symmetry. A third positive trait: The overall decline in the base is a mild 18.7% from head to toe.Monolithic, an expert in mixed-signal circuits including DC converters, LED drivers and audio amplifiers, holds a 97 Composite Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup in IBD's fabless semiconductors industry group. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 33% to 77 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) is trying to clear a cup base that shows a 21.23 entry. This base is unique, particularly on a daily chart. For starters, the nine-week pattern has elements of a double bottom. Yet the stock has a volatile streak, so the jagged price action can generally be treated as a cup.Second, as seen only on a daily chart, it formed a tight handle, starting with a down day on Feb. 28. That produced a 20.42 entry, a dime above the handle's intraday high. Volume on the breakout from that early buy point was light.San Diego-based Halozyme specializes in recombinant human enzymes for the drug delivery, encrinology and oncology fields of medicine. It turned profitable in recent quarters. The small-cap firm posted earnings of 2 cents and 85 cents a share in Q3 and Q4 last year, respectively.The Dow Jones transportation average outperformed on Tuesday, rising 0.5%. Airlines gave the sector index a nice push up. Ryanair (RYAAY) is building a cup base that appears to have made two handles. The most recent handle has a 125.32 entry.The Irish discount carrier is one of the highest-rated companies in IBD's airline group, which has moved from 88th to 34th over the past six weeks in terms of six-month performance. Ryanair, a large cap with a $29 billion market value, has posted four straight quarters of profit growth, averaging 28% per quarter. Q1 profit is seen climbing 27% to 28 cents a share.Meanwhile, real estate data provider Zillow (Z), highlighted in this column on March 5, has now rallied 17% past a breakout from a solid cup with handle and a 48.59 buy point. Thus, shares are now extended.Tip: Before making any investment decisions, be sure to check current market conditions, and use IBD Stock Checkup to see if your stock gets passing ratings for the most important fundamental and technical criteria.

(YY) and 58.com (WUBA) now have proper bases after consolidating for six weeks. That means they all have proper potential buy points.X Alibaba and messaging giant Tencent are archrivals, while JD.com is Alibaba's top competitor in e-commerce specifically. Tencent is JD.com's top investor as part of a strategic alliance. YY Inc. and 58.com both reported better-than-expected earnings last week, but gave weak guidance.

But while Tencent has consolidated for six weeks, the minimum for a cup-without-handle pattern, a proper cup-with-handle base requires at least seven weeks.Tencent's RS line hasn't made progress since late November, but is near record highs.YY plunged 10.3% to 110.99 last week, tumbling through its 50-day/10-week line in huge volume, a notable sell signal for YY stock.

1313,CL,"With enthusiasm fading for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone X product cycle, investor focus has moved to the company's plans to boost its returns to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.X Apple is expected to update its capital return plans with its fiscal second-quarter report in April. At that time, the company should provide specifics on how much of its repatriated foreign cash will be dedicated to dividends and buybacks. In January, Apple announced plans to bring home about $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to fund capital expenditures and other uses.""We think Apple's solid free cash flow and $163 billion net cash balance will result in a meaningful step-up in capital allocation next quarter,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday. ""Given limited appetite to do deals and benefits from current tax reform, we expect Apple to return much of the ongoing free-cash-flow generation back to shareholders.""Daryanani believes Apple will continue to avoid doing large acquisitions. So rumors of Apple buying a company like Snap (SNAP) are likely false.""Our baseline assumption (for Apple) is $59 billion in free cash flow annually, growing mid-single digits, which is utilized 60% ($35 billion) for buybacks and 40% for dividends (implies yield gets to about 2.6% vs. current at 1.3%),"" Daryanani said. ""Further, Apple could target incremental $25 billion-plus annual buybacks from balance sheet cash, implying total share reduction over the next 5 years could be about 1.6 billion shares (31% share reduction in total, about 7% annually).Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

1319,CL,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

1324,CL,"As Facebook (FB) shares plunged to a 7-month low before recovering somewhat Tuesday, analysts still were viewing it as a buying opportunity despite the risks of government investigations and possible regulations slapped on the social networking giant.XFacebook shares were down more than 9% in the past two days due to negative reports about Cambridge Analytica, a data mining and analysis firm that was employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign and collected data on some 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. The revelations have led to calls for several investigations, both in the U.S. and U.K., with the company already under scrutiny for how it collects and uses data.Complicating matters, the New York Times reported late Monday that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will leave the social networking giant in the wake of internal disagreements over how to probe and disclose Russian mischief on the site. Stamos had advocated for investigating and disclosing information about Russian disinformation and other fake news, sometimes clashing with top executives, including Chief Operating Office Sheryl Sandberg, the report said.In addition, British Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she will vigorously probe whether Facebook data were illegally acquired and used. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in a Twitter post also announced that a Facebook investigation will be launched. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also probing whether Facebook violated terms of a consent decree over its handing of user data that was transferred to Cambridge Analytica, Bloomberg reported.Facebook shares ended the regular session down 2.6% to finish at 168.15 on the stock market today. trading below its 50 and 200-day line. The news also impacted shares of other social media sites — Twitter (TWTR), which plunged more than 19% to close at 31.35 and Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), off nearly 2.6% to finish at 16.Despite the pressure being put on Facebook, Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained a buy rating on Facebook and a price target of 235.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1327,CL,"You are watching shares of a new IPO and wonder, ""Is it experiencing heavy institutional demand?"" To help answer the question, don't forget to use the up/down volume ratio.In an instant, the up/down volume ratio gives you a sense of how strong is the level of turnover on the upside if a stock is forming a complete new base, such as a cup with handle or double bottom, or ready to break out past a proper entry point and launch into new highs.The ratio compares the total amount of volume during up days in price vs. down days within the past 50 trading sessions. This time frame is significantly shorter than IBD's proprietary Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which covers 65 days, or about 13 weeks.Readings above 1.0 indicate that volume on the upside is higher than on the downside. But a reading of 1.5 is considered unusually strong, so look for IPO stocks that post a reading at this level or higher.Find the up/down ratio by looking in the ""Supply and Demand"" portion of Stock Checkup at investors.com or on the left-side panel of all Leaderboard charts)If a new initial public offering has not traded long, the Accumulation and RS ratings are less helpful.Roll the clock back nearly 12 years to when internet search giant Alphabet (GOOGL) (known back then as Google) cleared a 113.58 buy point of a perfect IPO base in September 2004.The base took just 15 trading days to form. The mild decline of 13% from the base's high of 113.48 to low of 98.94 showed that big fund managers weren't so eager to exit the stock.When Alphabet broke out of its IPO base on Sept. 15, 2004, its up/down volume ratio was a whopping 4.7. Indeed, volume on the upside towered over the downside.In the week before its breakout, the ratio was 3.6, also unusually strong.After a stunning breakout, the internet content group leader soared 318% from its breakout past a 113.58 buy point to a high of 475.11 in the week ended Jan. 13, 2006. More than 12 years later, Alphabet still hits new highs and boasts a long track record of growing profits and revenue.The correction in IPO bases can be shallow — less than 20%. Or, if the market is volatile, the correction can be much deeper. The buy point in a narrow IPO base is 10 cents above the high on the left side of the pattern.A high up/down volume ratio doesn't always guarantee investing success. After you buy a new IPO, pay close attention to the price-and-volume action. After a solid rally, negative reversals after hitting new highs, big drops in heavy or rising turnover, and weak rebounds in light trade may signal it's time to ditch the stock. And never forget the golden rule of investing.Fitness tracking device maker Fitbit's (FIT) IPO base formed over five days before the July 1, 2015, breakout. By the week's end, its up/down volume ratio was a stunning 4.0.Shares broke out past a 40.55 entry and rose 28% in just five weeks before topping out. When a stock makes such a 20%-25% gain over a period of up to eight weeks, it triggers a key sell signal that encourages investors to take at least some profits and sell into strength.Today, Fitbit shares trade near 5.28 a share, 87% below that proper buy point in 2015.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters(A version of this column was first published in the April 8, 2016, edition of IBD.

1340,CL,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers. Managers are not afraid to make strong sector or stock bets if they see solid long-term potential.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTop 10 holdings represent 33% of assets and include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), Sony (SNE), Abiomed (ABMD), BlackBerry (BB) and Micron Technology (MU), which rallied between 52% and 386% last year.T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

1341,CL,"The Dow Jones industrial average is capping a solid week of gains with a 1.5% advance Friday afternoon to help lead the major U.S. equity indexes. But more importantly, stocks in numerous sectors are showing strength following good breakouts.X Just one example: Tenaris (TS), the expert in steel pipes for the energy industry, burst out of a long cup with handle at 36.43 as shares rolled 2.5% higher to 37.09. Volume was running 150% above average, just what you like to see on breakout day.Tenaris recently joined IBD Leaderboard. The Luxembourg-based company recently posted hot Q4 results (earnings per share up 575% to 27 cents, sales up 52% to $1.59 billion) and is expected to grow 2018 profit 42% to $1.09 a share.Meanwhile, stocks in the leisure, internet, chip and medical sectors continued to command the upside.Booking Holdings (BKNG), 58.com (WUBA), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) (extended past an aggressive entry at 215.10) and Google operator Alphabet (GOOGL) (forming a new cuplike base) all scored solid gains of more than 1% and continue to act as market leaders.Booking, formerly known as Priceline Group, represents the strength of the airline, cruise and hotel markets. Shares posted a sixth straight gain, rising nearly 1% to 2,170 and edging nearly 5% past a breakout point of 2,068.09. Booking was highlighted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week.58.com, the Craigslist of China and a former IBD Leaderboard member, is back above its 50-day line as shares jumped more than 6% to 82.41 in heavy turnover. Watch for a potential new cup base to form. The base's left side peak is 87.65.58.com, now a mid-cap firm with a market value of $12 billion, has posted strong earnings in the past four quarters as revenue lifted 24%, 31%, 34% and 41% vs. year-ago levels in the same time frame.The Street sees Q1 profit jumping 150% to 25 cents a share and rising 25% to $2.42 for the year, then accelerating 48% to $3.59 a share in 2019.At 2 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite caught up with the 30-stock Dow, also gaining 1.5%. The small S&P 600 rallied 1.3% but is still trailing the 500 in year-to-date performance, up more than 3.3%. The 500 is up 3.9% since Jan. 1.Volume is running mildly higher vs. the same time on Thursday in both main exchanges on Wall Street.The Dow, which got scorched with a nearly 3.1% loss in the prior week, is close to recouping all of those losses. Watch to see if the blue chip index can retake its 50-day moving average.The Nasdaq remains the leading index, striking new all-time highs. At 7532, the tech, medical, banking and retail-driven index is now up 9.1% since Jan. 1.Going back to Tenaris, the stock enjoys a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- on a scale of A+ (heavy net buying by fund managers) to E (heavy net selling), as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating helps offset Tenaris' relatively weak EPS Rating of 79 and boosts the stock's overall Composite Rating to a very healthy 95 on a scale of 1 to 99.Keep in mind that commodity stocks can show big cyclicality in profits. Tenaris is no different.Tenaris' earnings peaked at $2.88 a share in 2012, then fell sharply over the next four years ($2.63 a share in 2013, $1.96 in 2014, a net loss of 17 cents in 2015, a net profit of 2 cents in 2016). Such a record certainly impacts a stock's EPS Rating because IBD's proprietary measure of profit growth takes into account three to five years' worth of results, not just the past few quarters.That dismal performance was likely tied to the severe drop in crude oil prices and a dismantling of exploration and production capacity in the industry. But now, WTI prices are aiming at making new multiyear highs and production is booming in North America.Tenaris saw its earnings soar to 77 cents a share in 2017. The Street sees earnings rising 42% to $1.09 a share this year, and another 45% in 2019.Revenue declined on a year-over-year basis for nine quarters in a row, through the first quarter of 2017. Yet since then, Tenaris has now grown the top line by 18%, 32% and 52% in the past three quarters. In Q4 of last year, net margin soared 760 basis points to 10.1%.Amid a strong February U.S. jobs report, institutions sold long bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note climbed to as high as 2.91%.West Texas Intermediate oil futures shot 3% higher to $62.13 a barrel, trading 6% below the Jan. 26 peak of $66.14.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

1353,CL,"HOUSTON — Tech giants Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) have raced to apply artificial intelligence to their businesses, and the oil industry is starting to seize on AI's benefits too.X Babur Ozden, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Maana, said he has heard from 20 large oil companies inquiring about artificial intelligence in the last 12 months, up from just six or seven in the prior 12 months.The reason interest is surging now is because artificial intelligence is ""actually doable,"" he said in an interview with IBD at CERAWeek, explaining that advancements in cloud computing and infrastructure have made AI more affordable and accessible.""The industrial world is waking up to best practices,"" he said. ""They are all waking up to it.""Several heavyweights in the energy industry are already investors in his company, including General Electric (GE), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Saudi Aramco.Shares of Chevron closed down 0.4% on the stock market today.

Start NowFor now, the energy industry is implementing artificial-intelligence technology in repetitive, everyday tasks like forecasting demand for liquefied natural gas.But Ozden believes AI can help oil companies improve decision-making across the enterprise, while also improving efficiency and operations.The benefits to an international oil and gas company could be measured in a few billion dollars a year, he estimates, as AI is applied to tasks that are reasonably expensive, time-consuming and prone to human error.To be sure, AI won't change the industry overnight. Instead, it will probably take about a decade for AI's use to be fully optimized, Ozden predicted.But he agrees with ConocoPhillips (COP) Chief Technology Officer Gregory Leveille that there will be autonomous drilling en masse before autonomous cars are on the roads en masse.""I believe so because of the complexity of having a car in a metropolitan environment with a number of moving things around it,"" Ozden said.

YY shares initially broke out in mid-July with a 61.62 buy point.

1365,CL,"Neuropsychologist Richard Chaifetz was thinking big when he graduated with his doctorate in 1981.He saw an opportunity to provide broad-based mental health services to the general public and opened a dozen psychological treatment centers in the Midwest, with the goal of a national franchise system. To fund this, he committed to advertising in the Yellow Pages for $10,000 a month charged to a credit card, since he only had a few thousand dollars to his name.""If I hadn't succeeded, I'd have gone bankrupt,"" Chaifetz, the CEO and chairman of ComPsych Corp., told IBD from his Chicago office. ""I knew professionals in the mental health field often didn't have good business acumen, and I saw an attractive opportunity for them if I could provide infrastructure, marketing and oversight. But then the insurance model began to change from direct reimbursement for patients to coverage by HMOs. I expanded services in 1984, pioneering employee assistance programs or EAPs and eventually selling off the mental health centers.""He succeeded, in spades. Today, ComPsych is the world's largest provider of customized programs for improving the lives of workers, ranging from overall wellness and work-life balance to meeting their needs for expert legal and financial help. It serves 100 million people in 160 countries, helping its 45,000 clients, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Hilton Hotels (HLT), to retain their best employees and increase productivity.Crain's Chicago Business last April estimated annual revenues for the privately held company at $475 million for 2016. According to Chaifetz, ""We've always had double-digit growth, so I expect them to estimate an increase of more than 10% for last year.""Chaifetz, 64, was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and attended Eastern Military Academy in Huntington on Long Island, after his parents divorced. Upon graduation, he was one of only two cadets to receive appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but turned it down because the Army wasn't where he wanted to spend his life. At the advice of Eastern's headmaster, he instead attended Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Mo.But in the second semester of his freshman year working towards a degree in psychology, his father, with whom he had little contact after his parents' divorce, stopped paying his tuition and his mother couldn't provide enough on her teacher's salary for him to continue. Chaifetz refused to give up and pleaded with the university president to let him stay, committing not only to pay off his student debt, but to do something big for the university once he became successful.Permission granted, he worked at all kinds of jobs part-time during the school year and full-time in summer, including at mental health facilities, graduating magna cum laude in 1975. He went on to earn his Psy.D at Illinois School of Professional Psychology.""Psychology can be fluffy and I was attracted to the fact that neuropsychology, which is the study of the relationship between brain function and behavior, emotion and cognition, was more scientific and exact in coming to a diagnosis,"" Chaifetz said.He never forgot his promise to Saint Louis University, and in 2007, Chaifetz and his wife Jill donated $12 million as the lead gift to build Chaifetz Arena, an $80 million, 10,600-seat sports facility. They also funded the Chaifetz Trading Center at her alma mater, the Farmer School of Business at Miami University-Oxford in Oxford, Ohio, with $3 million.""We pioneered fully integrated EAPs to cover everything from crisis intervention to disability management, under our GuidanceResources brand, for organizations from small, private concerns to the Fortune 100,"" Chaifetz said. ""To be able to grow globally and serve so many industries, we empower our own employees to solve problems with a custom-fit for client needs. We encourage them not only to innovate, we expect them to challenge the status quo, helping us to avoid falling into the standardization trap that big companies often do.""ComPsych recruits for high-energy, intellectually curious, creative individuals who are willing to test the limits within the boundaries of good business sense. The selection process not only uses extensive interviewing and background checks, but also tests and uses role-playing to make sure candidates fit the culture. The new hires are tasked to create superstars in other organizations and are incentivized by rewards for performance. As boomers retire and more millennials are hired, Chaifetz is confident about the company's future.""Studies have shown that younger people want meaningful work, and we believe our entrepreneurial culture is an excellent fit,"" Chaifetz said.ComPsych has gradually expanded its offerings. One of the most critical is absence management, which helps companies meet the requirements of the two-decade-old U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) at a lower cost with less liability exposure. Health care organizations have the largest percentage of employees on leave in a given year at 39%, while hotel and hospitality employees have the lengthiest absences overall, averaging more than 30 days. ComPsych's integrated EAPs have helped health care worker absenteeism drop by 43%, while their life satisfaction has risen 59%.Another area where the company excels is in managing the opioid abuse crisis, which cost $20 billion in lost productivity in 2016, yet three-quarters of employers have not offered training on how to detect misuse. The fatality rate is six times higher than the world average, according to the United Nations. ComPsych's multi-pronged approach can include cognitive behavioral therapy, managing inpatient and outpatient treatment by leading providers, coordinating with pharmacies, family support and 24/7 access to online workshops with master-level clinicians.ComPsych's growth has been entirely organic and it counsels clients to be careful about how they go about mergers and acquisitions, since studies show 70% to 90% fail to pay for themselves. Clients are advised to have clearly defined core competencies they can leverage to expand and to avoid trying to merge cultures that are not compatible.""Most M&A problems are not due to miscalculating the financials, but because of the intangible aspects,"" Chaifetz said. ""You're buying the services of people and if their aspirations are not a good fit with the new company culture, financial goals are unlikely to come to fruition. That's where we can play an important role in helping clients make sure that they understand the needs and expectations of new employees.""Enlightened corporate leaders have come to see the cost-effectiveness of employee wellness services, but ComPsych is especially appreciated during crises. During Hurricane Harvey last summer, the company conducted more than 450 critical incident stress management sessions.In 2017, Chaifetz was given the Humanitarian Award by the Illinois Holocaust Museum. ""He always wanted to help people as a psychologist,"" Jill told the audience. ""He's been called the Michael Jordan of his industry, and he's pretty much a savant.""Dale Grenolds, executive vice president at ComPsych, says Chaifetz is the type of leader that lets you take risks and be autonomous.""At the same time, he's very direct in his feedback and clear about his expectations,"" Grenolds said. ""His drive and level of confidence push his people to achieve more and operate from a place of strength. And at times of crisis, he has a unique ability to create clarity and find solutions.""CEO of ComPsych Corp., world's leading provider of employee well-being programs.Overcame: The need for a completely new business model in the early years.Lesson: Attract clients by offering easy solutions for the areas where they have the biggest challenges.""Over-reliance on market research can stifle creativity and create a 'me too' organization which can marginalize opportunities.""

1376,CL,"Neuropsychologist Richard Chaifetz was thinking big when he graduated with his doctorate in 1981.He saw an opportunity to provide broad-based mental health services to the general public and opened a dozen psychological treatment centers in the Midwest, with the goal of a national franchise system. To fund this, he committed to advertising in the Yellow Pages for $10,000 a month charged to a credit card, since he only had a few thousand dollars to his name.""If I hadn't succeeded, I'd have gone bankrupt,"" Chaifetz, the CEO and chairman of ComPsych Corp., told IBD from his Chicago office. ""I knew professionals in the mental health field often didn't have good business acumen, and I saw an attractive opportunity for them if I could provide infrastructure, marketing and oversight. But then the insurance model began to change from direct reimbursement for patients to coverage by HMOs. I expanded services in 1984, pioneering employee assistance programs or EAPs and eventually selling off the mental health centers.""He succeeded, in spades. Today, ComPsych is the world's largest provider of customized programs for improving the lives of workers, ranging from overall wellness and work-life balance to meeting their needs for expert legal and financial help. It serves 100 million people in 160 countries, helping its 45,000 clients, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Hilton Hotels (HLT), to retain their best employees and increase productivity.Crain's Chicago Business last April estimated annual revenues for the privately held company at $475 million for 2016. According to Chaifetz, ""We've always had double-digit growth, so I expect them to estimate an increase of more than 10% for last year.""Chaifetz, 64, was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and attended Eastern Military Academy in Huntington on Long Island, after his parents divorced. Upon graduation, he was one of only two cadets to receive appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but turned it down because the Army wasn't where he wanted to spend his life. At the advice of Eastern's headmaster, he instead attended Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Mo.But in the second semester of his freshman year working towards a degree in psychology, his father, with whom he had little contact after his parents' divorce, stopped paying his tuition and his mother couldn't provide enough on her teacher's salary for him to continue. Chaifetz refused to give up and pleaded with the university president to let him stay, committing not only to pay off his student debt, but to do something big for the university once he became successful.Permission granted, he worked at all kinds of jobs part-time during the school year and full-time in summer, including at mental health facilities, graduating magna cum laude in 1975. He went on to earn his Psy.D at Illinois School of Professional Psychology.""Psychology can be fluffy and I was attracted to the fact that neuropsychology, which is the study of the relationship between brain function and behavior, emotion and cognition, was more scientific and exact in coming to a diagnosis,"" Chaifetz said.He never forgot his promise to Saint Louis University, and in 2007, Chaifetz and his wife Jill donated $12 million as the lead gift to build Chaifetz Arena, an $80 million, 10,600-seat sports facility. They also funded the Chaifetz Trading Center at her alma mater, the Farmer School of Business at Miami University-Oxford in Oxford, Ohio, with $3 million.""We pioneered fully integrated EAPs to cover everything from crisis intervention to disability management, under our GuidanceResources brand, for organizations from small, private concerns to the Fortune 100,"" Chaifetz said. ""To be able to grow globally and serve so many industries, we empower our own employees to solve problems with a custom-fit for client needs. We encourage them not only to innovate, we expect them to challenge the status quo, helping us to avoid falling into the standardization trap that big companies often do.""ComPsych recruits for high-energy, intellectually curious, creative individuals who are willing to test the limits within the boundaries of good business sense. The selection process not only uses extensive interviewing and background checks, but also tests and uses role-playing to make sure candidates fit the culture. The new hires are tasked to create superstars in other organizations and are incentivized by rewards for performance. As boomers retire and more millennials are hired, Chaifetz is confident about the company's future.""Studies have shown that younger people want meaningful work, and we believe our entrepreneurial culture is an excellent fit,"" Chaifetz said.ComPsych has gradually expanded its offerings. One of the most critical is absence management, which helps companies meet the requirements of the two-decade-old U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) at a lower cost with less liability exposure. Health care organizations have the largest percentage of employees on leave in a given year at 39%, while hotel and hospitality employees have the lengthiest absences overall, averaging more than 30 days. ComPsych's integrated EAPs have helped health care worker absenteeism drop by 43%, while their life satisfaction has risen 59%.Another area where the company excels is in managing the opioid abuse crisis, which cost $20 billion in lost productivity in 2016, yet three-quarters of employers have not offered training on how to detect misuse. The fatality rate is six times higher than the world average, according to the United Nations. ComPsych's multi-pronged approach can include cognitive behavioral therapy, managing inpatient and outpatient treatment by leading providers, coordinating with pharmacies, family support and 24/7 access to online workshops with master-level clinicians.ComPsych's growth has been entirely organic and it counsels clients to be careful about how they go about mergers and acquisitions, since studies show 70% to 90% fail to pay for themselves. Clients are advised to have clearly defined core competencies they can leverage to expand and to avoid trying to merge cultures that are not compatible.""Most M&A problems are not due to miscalculating the financials, but because of the intangible aspects,"" Chaifetz said. ""You're buying the services of people and if their aspirations are not a good fit with the new company culture, financial goals are unlikely to come to fruition. That's where we can play an important role in helping clients make sure that they understand the needs and expectations of new employees.""Enlightened corporate leaders have come to see the cost-effectiveness of employee wellness services, but ComPsych is especially appreciated during crises. During Hurricane Harvey last summer, the company conducted more than 450 critical incident stress management sessions.In 2017, Chaifetz was given the Humanitarian Award by the Illinois Holocaust Museum. ""He always wanted to help people as a psychologist,"" Jill told the audience. ""He's been called the Michael Jordan of his industry, and he's pretty much a savant.""Dale Grenolds, executive vice president at ComPsych, says Chaifetz is the type of leader that lets you take risks and be autonomous.""At the same time, he's very direct in his feedback and clear about his expectations,"" Grenolds said. ""His drive and level of confidence push his people to achieve more and operate from a place of strength. And at times of crisis, he has a unique ability to create clarity and find solutions.""CEO of ComPsych Corp., world's leading provider of employee well-being programs.Overcame: The need for a completely new business model in the early years.Lesson: Attract clients by offering easy solutions for the areas where they have the biggest challenges.""Over-reliance on market research can stifle creativity and create a 'me too' organization which can marginalize opportunities.""

1388,CL,"Niche no more: Walmart (WMT) is expanding its footprint in the meal kit business, which means the once-indie cooking segment is now just another part of the Amazon (AMZN)-vs.-Walmart sparring ground.X The nation's largest brick-and-mortar retailer said Monday that its $8-to-$15 meal kits, complete with pre-portioned ingredients, are now in 250 locations, and will soon be sold in more than 2,000 stores in 2018. And shoppers who order their groceries online for in-store pickup can also add meal kits to their cart.Additionally, Walmart's extended foray into the area includes kits that supplement the retail chain's rotisserie chicken — one kit plus one chicken equals Thai curry chicken or chicken fried rice, for example — and pre-prepared ""one-step"" meals such as meatloaf and pot roast. All kits serve two people.Amazon introduced meal kits sometime last year through its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, albeit with a higher price tag. Prices appear to range from $8 to $9.99 per serving in each kit.That puts two heavyweights in contention — each moving assertively into the overall grocery space — with smaller meal-kit pure plays such as Blue Apron (APRN), HelloFresh, and Plated, the latter of which was acquired by grocery player Albertsons last year. Albertsons, privately held for years, plans to go public again via its recent deal to acquire drugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD).IBD'S TAKE: This Walmart-Amazon battle is far from over. Read our recent cover story on where this retail war stands in 2018.Blue Apron, which went public last June, hasn't been able to find much footing, with shares sliding well over 70% from their IPO. Shares fell 5.1% to close at 2.60 in the stock market today.Meanwhile, Walmart is finding support at its longer-term 200-day line after slicing its 50-day on Feb. 20, due to weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and online sales as well as tepid profit guidance. Walmart rose 1.4% to 89.98 Monday.

1431,CL,"HelloFresh, the German meal-kit company, has agreed to buy competitor Green Chef as it seeks to challenge industry pioneer Blue Apron (APRN) for supremacy in the U.S.Green Chef sells organic, paleo and gluten-free meal kits — a new area of the market for HelloFresh. The deal was announced in a regulatory filing Tuesday that didn't include terms. Green Chef is expected to contribute about $15 million in quarterly revenue, starting in the second quarter, according to the filing.HelloFresh, which is the largest meal kit company in the world and ranks second in the key U.S. market, saw sales gain more than 50% last year to about $1.1 billion. The company says it will turn a profit in 2018 and pass industry pioneer Blue Apron in U.S. sales. Blue Apron shares were down 4.6% to 2.07.With Green Chef, HelloFresh can go after customers who use meal kits to tailor their diets, according to Tobias Hartmann, who runs the company's U.S. operations.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""It's something we don't currently offer,"" he said. ""It follows our logic of constantly innovating and offering more choices to our customers.""Berlin-based HelloFresh's shares have gained 16% this year, and are up 35% since listing last November in Germany. The company generates more than 60% of its revenue in the U.S. Privately held Green Chef is based in Boulder, Colo.The meal kit industry has been dogged by concerns since the troubled public offering from New York-based Blue Apron, which has seen its shares plunge since the stock debuted at $10. The shares have been battered by Amazon.com (AMZN) push into the grocery industry and concerns about the subscription meal-kit model.Blue Apron recently said it wants to start selling meal kits in brick-and-mortar stores, part of a broader trend of conventional retailers getting into the business in response to shifting shopping habits. Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) have both launched meal kits. Albertsons, one of the largest supermarket chains in the U.S., bought meal-kit competitor Plated last year — part of the company's response to Amazon's deal to buy Whole Foods.HelloFresh has tested selling its meal kits in European stores, but plans to stick with online subscription sales for now. While the company faced questions about the industry's viability during investor meetings before its IPO last year, it's intent on proving that the business can be profitable, according to Hartmann.""We're a completely different animal,"" he said.

1441,CL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 fell significantly Thursday morning after the major averages reversed lower Wednesday following the Fed rate hike.

Meanwhile, Trump is likely to impose at least $30 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports for China's handling of U.S. intellectual property.And then there's Facebook, which offers a broader lesson for investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOver the past week or so, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and China Lodging Group (HTHT) sold off sharply after setting up in bases with proper buy points. These are great examples of why investors should wait for a proper breakout and resist the temptation to buy shares early.Oracle, Tencent and China Lodging all sold off recently on earnings reports, always a high risk/high reward situation.Facebook tumbled this week on news that a third party had data on 50 million users, with Facebook's long-term policies and its short-term response coming under fire. Alphabet retreated along with Facebook, as investors worried about the potential fallout on U.S. consumer internet giants from consumers, advertisers and regulators.Facebook and Alphabet had just finished cup-with-handle bases last Friday, when the Cambridge Analytica reports hit that evening and over the weekend. Facebook fell 9% over Monday-Tuesday, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages before rising slightly Wednesday. But shares were down 2% early Thursday, following Zuckerberg's Wednesday night interview with CNN in which he expressed his regret for the breach of trust.Alphabet has retreated 3.5% through Wednesday, below its 50-day line.Oracle topped a 53.24 last week, but never closed above that level. Shares were still close when Oracle reported better-than-expected earnings Monday night. But investors focused on weaker-than-expected cloud revenue growth, which slowed from the prior quarter, and guidance for continued deceleration in cloud revenue gains. Oracle plunged 9.4% on Tuesday.The Chinese internet giant topped earnings estimates early Thursday, but revenue growth came in a little light. Tencent, which had been 3% off a cup base buy point, sold off 3%. Tencent did hold above its 50-day line and the messaging and gaming titan could soon form a handle, creating a lower buy point. But buying now would simply recreate the same potential risk.China Lodging was working on a late-stage cup-with-handle base last week. Shares closed March 14 below the 50-day line, which was not a great sign. Then China Lodging came up short with its earnings report, sending the stock tumbling 10% the next session.Watching a top-rated stock move up in a base, waiting for it to clear a proper buy point can make investors restless. You might think to yourself that you can save a percentage point or two by buying a stock just below a buy point. But that's literally penny wise, pound foolish. If a stock is going to blast out of a base and run up sharply, the fractional additional gain won't matter. But if the stock falls back, you're can be stuck with a loss.A breakout maximizes your chances of winning, winning now and winning big. With the stock at or near a new high, essentially every investor is happy. No one is desperate to sell. To add shares, mutual funds have to bid up the price.Conversely, if you buy just below a buy point, that's when weak holders are deciding whether or not to bow out. Weak holders may have bought the stock at the prior high. After holding on and finally seeing a stock get back to break-even, they may start to sell. That's a reason why handles will often form in stocks before breaking out, and those modest pullbacks also encourage further selling.Ideally, selling is modest, and the stock can then power ahead. But sometimes a stock near a breakout and then pull back significantly over the short- or long-term.Obviously, bad news, whether stock-specific, industrywide and the broader market, can strike at any time. But with a breakout, if the stock performs poorly, there are clear technical signals. If a stock has run up some, you'll have a cushion so you can weather the sell-off or take profits, usually avoiding a loss.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: 4 Reasons Why The Market Reversal Wasn't So BadSee Which Stocks Just Got Added To – Or Cut From – IBD's Top Stock Lists Fed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 Outlook

That sparked harsh criticism from U.S. and U.K. politicians and is latest black eye for CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he deals with criticism over his platform's huge size and how it operates.Meanwhile, the FANG internet giant hasn't been a market leader for months, unlike fellow FANGs Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon and, to a lesser extent, Alphabet.Its relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, hasn't made headway since late July, trending down since start of November. You want to see a stock that is truly leading the market. Why else invest in a specific stock, with all that company risk, if it's not providing a return over the general market. The RS line is the blue line in the chart below.Alphabet, which is in a consolidation and may soon have its own handle, have only risen 8% to Facebook's 5%. That's a far cry from Netflix's 66% and Amazon's 33% — but Alphabet's RS line has been performing better.Meanwhile, Facebook's growth story may be winding down. The social networking giant has acknowledged that users spent less time on the main Facebook site in the fourth quarter, and that's before new changes to the News Feed that will likely reduce engagement. User growth is slowing, with North America daily active users falling sequentially for the first time.At the same time, Facebook is ramping up spending on staff and other resources to curb fake news and prevent the platform from being exploited by Russia or others during political campaigns. That spending may be necessary, but it won't help profits.This week, the European Commission is expected to propose a 3% tax on digital revenue, including on online advertising, selling digital data and ""intermediary services"" in which platforms allow users to buy and sell goods and services to each other. The digital tax would hit Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter (TWTR), Apple (AAPL), Uber and others, mostly U.S. internet firms.Alphabet, Twitter, Amazon and Apple all fell 1% or so in the premarket.CACI bid some $7.2 billion, or $44 a share, for CSRA, consisting of $15 in cash plus 0.184 CACI share. CSRA had previously accepted a $40.75 all-cash offer from General Dynamics. CSRA said its board will evaluate the CACI offer.CACI shares were not yet active Monday morning, while CSRA rose 2.7% to 41.74. General Dynamics was not active.Given that acquiring companies often see their stocks decline, it's unclear how much of a premium CACI will actually be offering after Monday's stock market trading. Military contractor giant General Dynamics also might be able to nudge its offer higher if necessary.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Stocks Have Dipped Below Buy Points, But Don't Give Up On ThemQ1 Earnings: Who Joins Netflix, Twitter On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?These 5 Hot Stocks Are Simmering Just Below Buy Points Nike, Oracle, Micron, Fed Rate Hike, Trump Tariffs: Investing Action Plan

It was unclear why Tencent fell short, but the miss may have been at least partly due to a slowdown in mobile gaming revenue, reports said.Tencent shares fell 3% to close at 57.89 on the stock market today.

1484,CL,"LAS VEGAS — At a conference like Shoptalk, there's a lot of talk about trying to ""out-Amazon"" Amazon (AMZN). Some of it is hyperbole, some of it wishful thinking.X But JD.com's (JD) Silicon Valley research head Hui Cheng — eager to embrace the moniker of ""China's Amazon"" — reminded folks on Tuesday that the No. 2 Chinese e-commerce giant (behind Alibaba (BABA)) has several high-tech initiatives in the works, helping it keep abreast of its American counterpart.JD.com uses self-driving delivery vehicles the size of shopping carts — essentially delivery robots — on several university campuses in China, said Cheng, as it looks to close the gap on last-mile delivery.And according to a December report from the South China Morning Post, the online seller is investing about 10 billion yuan, or $1.5 billion, in autonomous driving and delivery technology.Amazon is in the self-driving arena too, reportedly applying for patents for autonomous ground vehicles and cobbling together a self-driving tech team, but is a ways off from bringing the tech to life.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

KLA-Tencor (KLAC) agreed to buy Orbotech in a $3.4 billion deal.

1486,CL,"The 2018 stock market has not been for the faint of heart, having already notched all-time highs and the biggest correction in two years. But some stock mutual funds have found ways to both post gains and surpass major indexes, often with investment strategies that include such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX) and Salesforce.com (CRM).X For the year through March 8, Fidelity Investments' Will Danoff and John Roth have deftly ridden such stocks to a nice 6.48% gain in the fund they manage: $28.5 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX). That compares with the S&P 500's 2.84%. The legendary Danoff is best known for managing the $129.6 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) since 1990, and with which he's outperformed every other stock fund with $100 billion or more in assets in the past 15 years.Many of their top holdings are riding a megatrend — people spending more time on the internet — that they see driving earnings growth and price appreciation for years to come.A key to the winning investment strategies they've used since New Insights' inception in 2003 is change. ""We always look for change,"" Danoff told IBD, ""and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition.""While New Insights is solidly in the large-cap growth camp, Roth brings in expertise in midcap stocks and a slight value tilt, which adds a level of flexibility to the managers' investment process as they navigate 2018 stock market trends.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportIn a wide-ranging Q&A, Danoff and Roth share how their flexible investment strategies allow them to uncover opportunities even as the bull market ages and many growth stocks get pricey. They also discuss their major holdings, including why they're bullish on Amazon, Netflix and Adobe.IBD: What is the strategy of your fund?Will Danoff: Fidelity Advisor New Insights is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. Both John and I believe that stocks over time follow the underlying earnings per share of the companies. I've joked in the past: You get two fund managers for the price of one. We created a sleeve structure two years ago: Will is running 60% of the fund, John is running 40% of the fund. John has a more value orientation, I have a more growth orientation.IBD: What is the main trend in the market today and how are you integrating it in the fund?Danoff: I'm looking for the best stocks in the market and companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage but are growing in this environment, gaining market share, are able to leverage technology and find certain trends like Cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) or just more and more people and more and more companies spending more time on the internet. That's probably the megatrend that we're all living in.John Roth: I've spent half my time at Fidelity as a value-ish analyst and half as a growth analyst. I prefer to buy growth stocks — I think they're more fun, more interesting. But I think you can also make money in turnarounds and other things that the market has left by the wayside.Nine years into a bull market, I think there's some valuation concerns on the growth side, so that's taken some of my growth money out, but I still have a growth bias. I think the key is to be versatile and really take advantage of the opportunities the market gives you.Danoff: We're flexible and we'll go anywhere, so I really think that helps the fund. There aren't many constraints on what we can do. And John has been really good at anticipating which out-of-favor groups might come back into favor. And by looking for out-of-favor groups, that forces you to look at your existing names and say ""Wow, maybe all the good news has been discounted here.""IBD'S TAKE: As an individual investor, you want to stay in sync with the market. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.IBD: Speaking of which, could you give a few examples of trades in the past 12 months?Danoff: We were up 28% last year and tech helped a lot. Amazon was a nice overweight, Activision Blizzard (ATVI), PayPal (PYPL), Facebook (FB), Adobe — these were larger technology companies that grew very nicely.We always look for change and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition. When something's happening, Fidelity can hopefully move quickly.Last year was about avoiding some of the defensive names, General Electric (GE) obviously struggled with their earnings. ... We were underweight in a big way.IBD: Your fund profile talks about companies that are undervalued by the public. But obviously the public is focusing on the big tech names, so how are they undervalued or what is the additional value that you're seeing in them?Danoff: John and I are looking for misperceptions by the public. If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger (and) video. ... We're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer. I think I am more bullish on Facebook than the consensus and I own a lot of it.Roth: A lot of times these big names are right in front of you and it doesn't mean they're not going to be great stocks. Apple (AAPL) has been the poster child. Back in 2007, people got excited about the potential for the company to have $6 billion in revenue, and no one thought they'd go to $250 billion. And it unfolded slowly over the years right in front of you.IBD: What are your thoughts on the fact that we're late in the economic cycle and valuations are high?Danoff: Yes, we've had a long run since the bottom of the spring of 2009, earnings have more than doubled, stocks have more than tripled. The crisis of 2008-2009 I think was felt more deeply than people realize. … (The economic impact) was quite drastic.There was this massive footrace to put on the brakes — cutting costs, cutting capital spending. Sort of the whole world froze. I think Apple and Google were two of the only companies I'm aware of that grew earnings in the first two quarters of 2009.My point is, the starting point was quite drastic. And so even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing the costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending.The other observation I have is the world is much more global and U.S. companies are now able to sell their products all over the world. The big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive; they're high margin, they're high growth and they're highly cash generative. Yes, I think the market is expensive, but the market is not what it used to be. The quality of the companies is higher and estimates are going up.IBD: Would you look more outside of the U.S. to find good stocks?Roth: Our philosophy is turn over as many rocks as you can. The more you turn over, the higher the probability to find something good. If we find that the U.S. has less opportunities, then maybe we'll look harder in Europe. Europe has been slow to recover and there are some interesting names there. And the same would be true in Asia. You might see more names in the fund because we're trying to find new ideas.Danoff: The global research effort helps us so much. The global economy is much more integrated. We can talk to Asian tech companies who are part of the supply chain, or Samsung, which is a supplier and a competitor to so many of the big tech companies, and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). It's hugely helpful to understand where we are in the cycle in that particular industry.The trends we're seeing overseas are often similar, sometimes ahead of the trends that we see in the U.S., sometimes behind. But in terms of the big global companies, often the Nestles (NSRGY) and Unilevers (UN) are more defensive, and right now defensive is out of favor. So we're trying to pay attention to out-of-favor, but right now these stocks are not leading the market. This is the tension and the balance we have to find.IBD: The market had a short correction recently. How do you react in this kind of environment?Roth: We went through a very long period of no volatility and to the extent we see more volatility in the future as the economy heats up and the Fed gets more aggressive, it just means that we have to tighten our game up and look for dislocations every day. We've had some really big swings in the market where you could open up and then all of a sudden be down a fair amount, and so on an individual stock basis we're looking for bargains on the names that we really like. We do have some cash in the fund and we can be opportunistic. So a little bit of volatility is not a bad thing at all.IBD: Do you sell anything in those times?Danoff: You have to stay flexible and when fundamentals change, we all have stories when a top 10 position discloses some bad news and the stock is down and you start saying, ""Oh my God, one of my big positions is under pressure."" If there's competition from Amazon, or there's regulatory changes, or there's unexpected margin pressure, you can't stand still in this business.When the whole market sells off, John and I are looking for higher-quality companies that we can upgrade to.IBD: Considering the current increasing inflationary pressures, do you see any sector rotation or areas that may pop up that would be more advantageous for investors in 2018?Roth: We are seeing wage inflation. Everyone from Walmart (WMT) to most big companies have started to pay their employees more. These bonuses that are coming as a result of the tax cut will have the same effect.Who benefits? It's probably the financials to some extent, probably the energy companies, materials, gold. We have exposure to all of that, and we can easily shift if it looks like it's going to become more prevalent.IBD: What is your outlook for some of the big names in your fund?Danoff: Good news is good news. In an expansionary environment, Netflix is crushing it overseas. They're adding 5 million subs overseas a quarter and a couple million subs in the U.S. They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding, it's a subscription model offering great value for roughly $10-$11 a month. The average subscriber is spending 10 hours a week watching their content. Margins are going up and I am quite positive.Adobe has made a shift from licensed to Software-as-a-Service to the recurring revenue model. More and more people are spending more and more time on the web, so companies and individuals purchase Adobe software more frequently. Revenues are growing more than 20%, margins are going up and the company is generating a huge amount of free cash flow, so the outlook is very bright for Adobe. Could it sell off because it's expensive? Yes, both Adobe and Netflix could see multiples compression near-term, but I think over time both companies are very well positioned to grow, looking out three to five years.Amazon — wouldn't you want to partner with the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos? A week does not go by where somebody doesn't tell me, ""I love Amazon."" AWS, which is their cloud-computing business — they started before anybody else realized that could be a business — it's now I think an $18 billion business, growing roughly 40% a year; it's nicely profitable. In e-commerce, he's pushing hard into India, into food, in apparel — he's gaining market share. He's got a long way to go. Maybe I'd like him to show a little more profit because I think stocks follow earnings over time, but I'm confident that everything Amazon is investing in is ultimately going to generate a very strong return, and if that's the case, then profits will come over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners401(k) Experts Warn When NOT To Use A Target Date Fund2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltThe New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles And Ciscos?

1518,CL,"Sometimes the best lessons are worth repeating.Billionaire investor Warren Buffett used his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders on Saturday to again call out the wasteful fees that many money managers charge. He highlighted the risk of bonds and emphasized the importance of sticking with a simple investment strategy, rather than chasing returns.""Performance comes, performance goes,"" Buffett wrote. ""Fees never falter.""The letter, which was notably shorter than in years past, meditated on the investing lessons that the Berkshire chairman and chief executive officer thinks people should take away from his charitable bet against Protege Partners. Buffett challenged the asset manager to pick a group of hedge funds that it thought would beat an S&P 500 Index fund over 10 years. When the wager concluded on Dec. 31, the index fund had won easily.Buffett urged investors to stick with stocks even though they can be riskier in the short-term.""It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons — among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals — to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks,"" Buffett wrote. ""Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.""He also spent much of the letter explaining Berkshire's results for 2017, which were aided by a huge gain on the recent U.S. tax overhaul. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's insurance businesses, however, posted a rare underwriting loss.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportHe also discussed some of the challenges to finding large acquisitions. Cash has been piling up at Berkshire, but Buffett said most of the businesses he looked to buy last year were too expensive.

1519,CL,"The concept of a smart home has been in the works for more than 30 years and while Amazon (AMZN) may have finally nailed it with its home assistant Alexa, it's now adding to that with its latest acquisition of Ring.X On Tuesday, Amazon purchased Ring, the maker of a smart doorbell that streams audio and visual to smartphones, for a price reportedly above $1 billion. With Ring and a series of smaller acquisitions and organic initiatives, Amazon is building on its smart home product footprint in a race to be the market and mind share leader among consumers.""We believe Ring will be tightly integrated with Alexa/Echo as part of Amazon's beachhead strategy with the smart speaker market, which is showing major signs of success this year, coming off a banner holiday season,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note to clients Wednesday.Video doorbells, smart thermostats and smoke detectors, lights and other devices that connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can now be controlled by voice and smart speakers. Home security is also a priority with these devices. The Amazon Echo line of smart speakers, voiced by Alexa, the smart-talking speaker that connects to a growing number of in-home devices, have a big lead over Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) in this market.The main competitor to the Amazon Echo is the Google Home device by Alphabet. It was introduced in November 2016, two years after the arrival of Echo. Alphabet has since expanded the lineup with various next-generation devices, as has Amazon. In December, Amazon bought Blink, a maker of smart doorbell and porch cameras, adding to Amazon's line of connected home products that includes Echo smart speakers and Fire TV streaming devices.Apple was late to the market with its Apple HomePod. Apple announced the HomePod in June but missed the holiday shopping period.These and other smart speaker devices from other manufacturers are supported with artificial intelligence and are emerging as the central hub of the smart home. The smart home ecosystem represents a $20 billion market opportunity over the next three years with Alexa front and center, Ives wrote.Alphabet, in addition to Google Home, has Nest, acquired in 2014 for $3.2 billion. Nest makes a line of smart thermostats, security cameras and smoke detectors.""Amazon's purchase of Ring helps to equalize the automation push currently underway by Google Home and Nest,"" wrote Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, in a research note to clients. ""As Amazon moves more aggressively into the grocery delivery space, we believe smart security devices will be an important factor in driving user adoption.""IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Alphabet and Apple are strengthening their connection to customers with mobile and in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence. The devices could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.The acquisition of Ring arrives four months after Amazon unveiled an in-home delivery system, Amazon Key, which allows delivery people to let themselves into your home to drop off packages.Amazon's acquisition of Ring hit the shares of ADT (ADT), the home-security company. Shares of ADT were down 7%, near 10.80, during afternoon trading on the stock market today. ADT provides residential and small business electronic security, fire protection, and other related alarm monitoring services.Amazon shares were up marginally to close at 1,512.45.

Unlike Netflix, iQiyi sells advertising.""Online advertising grew 44% in 2017 to $1.3 billion (47% of total revenue), largely on par with industry average,"" added Chan in a report.

Cash burn on acquisition of licensed content has been a drag on free cash flow, similar to Netflix.In 2017, iQiyi had a loss of $592 million with revenue of $2.75 billion, up 54% from a year earlier.IQiyi's on-demand video content is similar to Netflix and provides TV shows and movies.

Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%. With technology being the top performing sector, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple's positions have each grown to represent 7%, 5% and 4.4% of the fund.LogMeIn (LOGM) is a midcap internet service company that provides a cloud-based platform for online meetings, customer support, remote access and password security. Its earnings and revenue skyrocketed between 94% and 216% the past four quarters. Earnings per share jumped 110% last year and analysts estimate a 29% increase this year. The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business. It's also on IBD's Leaderboard.Among banks, which are expected to benefit from rising interest rates, the fund holds Zions Bancorp (ZION) and SVB Financial (SIVB)).

Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices. The stock declined over 50% last year and has continued its slide this year.RELATED:What's Will Danoff Into These Days?What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

1542,CL,"Warren Buffett lords over an empire that sells everything from candy to car insurance. And on Saturday, the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) chief releases his hotly awaited annual letter to shareholders.X Investors in Berkshire Hathaway will look to learn what the Nebraska-based conglomerate will do with a rapidly swelling pile of cash that crossed $100 billion last September. They hope, too, for the 87-year-old chief to drop more clues on a succession plan.Buffett's letter to shareholders, combining insights from the legendary investor with humorous reflections, has appeared with clockwork regularity every year since 1977. They're archived on the Berkshire Hathaway website.Some Berkshire watchers are hoping the company will put its cash to use by expanding its portfolio of companies. Berkshire hasn't made a major purchase since its $37 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts, a maker of parts for jet engines and gas turbines, in 2015.CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert says Berkshire's acquisition strategy is less likely to focus on heavily regulated industries (like those in the financial services sector) when it can leverage upside to these industries via stock investments. Similarly, its technology exposure has been a result of investments, not acquisitions, she added.""Against that backdrop, our sense is future acquisitions will likely be in the energy, materials and industrials areas, and possibly health care and consumer staples,"" she wrote in a note Thursday, without naming specific companies.It's a different story on Buffett's stock buys. Buffett started purchasing Apple (AAPL) in 2016 and has steadily raised his stake in the iPhone maker's stock, which has jumped 25% in the past year alone. Apple is now Berkshire's largest stock holding, accounting for roughly 15% of his $191.2 billion portfolio at the end of 2017.Seifert is also watching for these items in the chairman's letter:Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway rose 1% to close at 202.76 on the stock market today.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAs Buffett struggles to find companies to buy, nearly all his cash hoard is held in U.S. Treasury bills. The cash pile increased by $3.3 billion this month after Phillips 66 (PSX) bought back 35 million shares from Berkshire Hathaway.Buffett may also write about using that money to pay a dividend — but the odds are slim. He's famously averse to such use of his money, but many Berkshire watchers say that a special cash dividend, a one-time affair at management's discretion, makes sense.On stock buybacks, Buffett has said he's open to such a move if the price falls below 120% of book value. As of Thursday, class B shares of Berkshire stock traded at about 160% of book value. But the giant cash stockpile may incline Berkshire's board and management to be less strict about that 120% buyback threshold, some say.Buffett's letter to shareholders also coincides with Berkshire's Q4 and full-year results.CFRA sees operating EPS of $6.32 in 2017 and expects underwriting results at Berkshire's core insurance and reinsurance units to remain under pressure in Q4, as damages from numerous disasters continued to pile up. But operating revenue growth in 2018 should quicken to 7%-9% from 6%-7% in 2017.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why This 99 Composite Rating Stock Just PlungedHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing SystemThe Big Picture: Here Are Two Reasons To WorryNot Every Market Follow-Through Works: 2 Red Flags To Watch For

1557,CL,"California state regulators on Monday approved testing and deployment regulations for autonomous cars without a human backup driver, allowing companies like General Motors (GM), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo and Tesla (TSLA) to fast-track the commercialization of the technology in the most populous state.XThe state Department of Motor Vehicles will post a public notice of that approval on its website on March 2, a month before permits start to be issued, reports said.The new rules require self-driving test cars on public roads to be monitored by a remote operator at all times. That operator must be able to take over control as needed and communicate with police and passengers in an emergency.Automakers also must provide an ""interaction plan"" instructing law enforcement and first responders ""on how to interact with the vehicle in emergency and traffic enforcement situations.""California is a hotbed for the testing of automated-driving technology. In January, the state DMV released its 2017 annual report compiling data from companies that test self-driving cars in the state. However, those test cars had backup or safety drivers.The data showed Waymo continues to hold a clear lead but GM's Cruise Automation is catching up fast, with both companies logging the most autonomous test miles in 2017. Both Waymo and GM improved their disengagement rate — the frequency at which a human driver had to take over the controls of the driverless cars — with Cruise's data showing vast improvement.The advocacy group Consumer Watchdog claimed the new rules threaten public safety. It argued that mandatory disengagement reports filed with the California DMV ""show the self-driving technology is not safe enough to be deployed without a human driver in the car capable of taking control when necessary.""IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. On Tuesday, Ford Motor (F) announced it is laying down a footprint for its autonomous-vehicle business in the congested streets of Miami and Miami Beach.Initially, Ford will conduct pilot programs with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and the delivery startup Postmates. While those test deliveries are not expected to be self-driving at first, Ford expects that lessons from ""this customer experience research will be applied to the design of our purpose-built self-driving vehicle that we plan to launch in 2021,""  Sherif Marakby, Ford vice president of autonomous vehicles wrote Tuesday in a Medium blog post.Ford also will set up its first autonomous fleet-management terminal in Miami and work closely with local dealers to integrate their operations into its self-driving service.""Before thousands of self-driving vehicles can hit the streets, we have to be prepared to manage large, high-tech fleets efficiently, and the steps we're taking in Miami represent a significant stride in that process,"" Marakby added.Shares of GM sank 3.3% on the stock market today, Alphabet gave up 2.3%, Tesla dropped 1.8% and Ford retreated 2.5%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

1558,CL,"Brazil's economy is bouncing back, which is good news for micromerchants such as taxi drivers, physical therapists and food truck operators. It's also good news for PagSeguro (PAGS), a payment processor that caters to those individual entrepreneurs and small businesses.X Shares in PagSeguro have jumped since its initial public offering in January, the New York Stock Exchange's biggest since Snap (SNAP) nearly a year ago, with its IPO raising about $2.27 billion.The reason: Some analysts compare PagSeguro to U.S.-based Square (SQ), which also focuses on small merchants that are often overlooked by big payment processors.""PagSeguro conquered a previously unexplored client base,"" said Domingos Falavina, a JPMorgan analyst who initiated coverage of the upstart with a neutral rating. ""We believe that as first movers, PagSeguro benefited from a positive, contagion effect. Merchants who started accepting cards likely experienced an increase in sales, which drove neighboring merchants to ask for advice on their payment terminal of choice.""PagSeguro, which provides online and mobile services, sells low-cost payment devices that enable micro-merchants to accept credit or debit cards rather than cash. Analysts estimate that three-fourths of the small businesses who buy PagSeguro's entry-level, mobile point-of-sale device did not accept card payments previously.That's similar to Square, which sells those tiny credit-card swipe dongles that plug into smartphones and Apple (AAPL) iPads. PagSeguro's ""Moderninha"" and ""Minizinha"" devices look like handheld calculators and connect to the internet via Wi-Fi or cellphone networks.One key to PagSeguro's success, analysts say, is that the company opted to sell point-of-sale devices to small merchants rather than lease them monthly — which has been the business model of larger rivals such as Cielo and Redecard.As Brazil's first payment processor to sell point-of-sale devices, PagSeguro has quickly gained traction in the micro-merchant and small-business market. Small merchants can pay off the device purchases in installments and still afford the payment services that PagSeguro provides. Word-of-mouth marketing should give PagSeguro a boost as Brazil's economy rebounds.Economic activity increased in 2017, marking the first expansion in four years. The economy expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in December. Consumer spending has surged due to record-low interest rates, slow inflation and falling unemployment. Brazil's government has focused on deregulation, privatization and deficit-cutting.Payment-processing companies owned by Banco Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Itau Unibanco Holding and Banco Santander Brasil make up more than three quarters of the industry. Cielo, the largest payment processor, is controlled by Bradesco and Banco do Brasil.

1566,CL,"U.S. wireless service providers led by Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) are racing to beat China in rolling out next-generation 5G services while internet companies could build their own private 5G networks, a telecom executive said Monday.X Speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said initial 5G network launches in the U.S. or China could occur in late 2018, or early 2019. Suri surprised the industry by saying longer-term, internet companies and others aim to build private 5G networks.Non-telecom customers could drive more network spending, said Andrew Gardiner, an analyst at Barclays.""Most interesting is the burgeoning area of what Nokia refers to as vertical industries,"" said Gardiner. ""They are seeing real interest in private network buildouts. Webscale (internet) providers are the obvious example given their size, but Nokia is seeing interest in private networks from governments, financial services companies and other large enterprises. They expect such activity to accelerate.""There has been speculation that e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) and Dish Network (DISH) could partner in 5G wireless services. A Citigroup report in May 2017 said a strategic deal could focus on the Internet of Things — web-connected devices.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), meanwhile, has been lobbying federal regulators to make shared radio spectrum available that could be used for 5G services.The advent of 5G networks is expected provide new services to web-connected industrial and consumer devices, drones and self-driving cars.According to the presentation by Nokia's Suri, the U.S. and China are ahead in 5G trials, with Japan and South Korea also pushing hard.

1568,CL,"Brazil's economy is bouncing back, which is good news for micromerchants such as taxi drivers, physical therapists and food truck operators. It's also good news for PagSeguro (PAGS), a payment processor that caters to those individual entrepreneurs and small businesses.X Shares in PagSeguro have jumped since its initial public offering in January, the New York Stock Exchange's biggest since Snap (SNAP) nearly a year ago, with its IPO raising about $2.27 billion.The reason: Some analysts compare PagSeguro to U.S.-based Square (SQ), which also focuses on small merchants that are often overlooked by big payment processors.""PagSeguro conquered a previously unexplored client base,"" said Domingos Falavina, a JPMorgan analyst who initiated coverage of the upstart with a neutral rating. ""We believe that as first movers, PagSeguro benefited from a positive, contagion effect. Merchants who started accepting cards likely experienced an increase in sales, which drove neighboring merchants to ask for advice on their payment terminal of choice.""PagSeguro, which provides online and mobile services, sells low-cost payment devices that enable micro-merchants to accept credit or debit cards rather than cash. Analysts estimate that three-fourths of the small businesses who buy PagSeguro's entry-level, mobile point-of-sale device did not accept card payments previously.That's similar to Square, which sells those tiny credit-card swipe dongles that plug into smartphones and Apple (AAPL) iPads. PagSeguro's ""Moderninha"" and ""Minizinha"" devices look like handheld calculators and connect to the internet via Wi-Fi or cellphone networks.One key to PagSeguro's success, analysts say, is that the company opted to sell point-of-sale devices to small merchants rather than lease them monthly — which has been the business model of larger rivals such as Cielo and Redecard.As Brazil's first payment processor to sell point-of-sale devices, PagSeguro has quickly gained traction in the micro-merchant and small-business market. Small merchants can pay off the device purchases in installments and still afford the payment services that PagSeguro provides. Word-of-mouth marketing should give PagSeguro a boost as Brazil's economy rebounds.Economic activity increased in 2017, marking the first expansion in four years. The economy expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in December. Consumer spending has surged due to record-low interest rates, slow inflation and falling unemployment. Brazil's government has focused on deregulation, privatization and deficit-cutting.Payment-processing companies owned by Banco Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Itau Unibanco Holding and Banco Santander Brasil make up more than three quarters of the industry. Cielo, the largest payment processor, is controlled by Bradesco and Banco do Brasil. Redecard is a unit of Itau Unibanco.PagSeguro has a different pedigree. PagSeguro is majority owned by Universo Online, Brazil's largest internet portal.

1574,CL,"U.S. stock indexes Thursday continued a recent trend of strong starts and weak finishes, a classic characteristic of a weakening market.

1575,CL,"Market breadth continues to improve as the key indexes showed solid gains on Monday with just two trading sessions remaining in February.X The advance is even more impressive given the negative reaction among a few Chinese companies trading on the NYSE, including New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL), amid news that China's leader, Xi Jinping, may be able to exceed his two-term limit as the country's president.TAL fell more than 5%, yet closed near the top of its intraday range. At 36.81, the stock also is holding mildly above a 36.26 buy point in a choppy late-stage base. TAL has been a monster winner, rising nearly six-fold since it initially broke out of an excellent cup with handle at 6.54 (adjusted for a 6-for-1 stock split) in the week ended Nov. 13, 2015. That base could also be interpreted as a double bottom.New Oriental, down 4% to 92.02, is trading just below a 50-day moving average and may be in the early stages of forming a new base.Plus, leading Chinese internet and e-commerce stocks don't seem to be having a severe reaction overall. Autohome (ATHM), part of IBD Leaderboard, fell more than 2%, but volume was mildly below average.The auto information website is up 28% year-to-date and remains on the north side of its 50-day moving average. Autohome, being a midcap firm with a market value of just under $10 billion, still tends to trade more wildly than, say, any stock on the Dow Jones industrial average.The Nasdaq gained 0.9% amid nice rallies by the FAANG stocks, while the S&P 500 matched that gain. Alphabet (GOOGL), which stands a good chance of posting mild double-digit profit growth in both 2018 and 2019, rose 1.1% to 1,141 in light trade and is working on new cup-type base.A cup base must be a minimum of six weeks in length, while a strong cup with handle should never be less than seven weeks.Alphabet is up more than 8% year to date, and its relative strength line (drawn in blue in every IBD chart) reflects outperformance vs. the S&P 500 for more than two weeks. The megacap tech is also up more than 13% (or extended) from an October breakout past a well-formed flat base that showed a 1,006.29 buy point, or a dime above the base's left-side peak set on July 24.The stock market followed through on Valentine's Day, when the Nasdaq ripped 1.9% higher in heavier volume vs. the prior day. That big gain came on day four of a new rally attempt following a nearly 12% correction by the leading market index.Also on Feb. 14, the S&P 500 rallied 1.3% higher as NYSE volume rose, marking a follow-through day of its own.Leading stocks lagged a bit, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gained just 0.5%. The exchange traded fund managed by Innovator Capital that tracks stocks in the IBD 50 was up more than 37% in 2017.Top industry groups for the day included solar, computer networking, RV makers, fiber-optic telecom equipment, mortgage services, airlines and movies, all up 2% or more. Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups fell 1% or more, including dairy products, home-furnishings retailers, specialty retailers and auto parts.Another reason why Monday's gain is impressive: U.S. new-home sales for January came in at 593,000 on an annualized rate, badly missing the Econoday estimate of 640,000. Indeed, interest-rate-sensitive names are struggling in 2018 as U.S. government bond prices keep falling, jacking up interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond was around 2.86%, still off its recent peak of 2.95%, but up from 2.40% at the end of last year.Year to date, at least 14 of IBD's 197 industry groups have risen 10% or more. And 11 groups sport an advance of 12% or more. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2779, is up less than 4% since Jan. 1, excluding dividends.Such information is vital for the growth investor. Why?Decades of research by IBD show that as much as half of a great stock market winner's move is influenced by the performance of its broad industry sector and precise industry group. For this reason, IBD ranks every one of the 197 industry groups and subgroups by six-month relative performance each day. See the current list in IBD Data Tables, featured inside IBD Stock Lists.Leisures-Movies and Retail-Internet are up 21% and 20%, respectively, since Jan. 1. You can see the entire list of companies making up each industry group by using MarketSmith, IBD's advanced-level stock screening and historical charting service.The other industry groups leading the market with rallies of 12% or more are desktop software, department stores, mail-order retailing, five software groups (enterprise, gaming, security, financial and education), and automakers.The software sector remains robust. Among the 33 sectors tracked in the market in IBD's unique stock research tables, Software is one of the top-performing tech sectors, at No. 6. The only other tech group in the top 10 for medium- and long-term performance is Internet, at No. 2.Alphabet has a 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup; Weibo (WB) and Grubhub (GRUB) are two of Alphabet's Internet sector mates and both have a 99 Composite on a scale of 1 to 99.The Composite Rating incorporates fundamentals (such as sales growth, earnings growth, ROE and margins), price action, and the quantity and quality of institutional ownership.Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) shot up 5% after hours after the innovative developer of enterprise-level security software and systems posted a 54% leap in fiscal second-quarter non-GAAP earnings to 63 cents a share on a 27% jump in total revenue to $542 million, a quarterly high.The results appear to confirm the company's ability to find ways to grow even after it had posted triple-digit EPS gains in almost routine fashion throughout the middle of 2015 through late 2016.The stock, up more than 2% to 169.32 in more than triple average volume, had built a seven week flat base with a 156.95 prime buy point, broke out on Jan. 18, then hit massive market turbulence as distribution days rocked the stock market averages from late January to early February.However, the stock showed bullish reversals and clear clues of institutional buying support near the 50-day moving average on two occasions in February, on the 6th and the 9th, then regained its 156.95 entry point in heavy volume on the same day as the Nasdaq's Feb. 14 follow-through, which signaled it's time to actively update your watch list and buy the best breakouts.IBD tech reporter Reinhardt Krause provides more details on Palo Alto's terrific earnings report in this story.(Please follow Krause and Chung on Twitter at @IBD_RKrause and @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, technology, the economy and financial markets.) Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersRELATED:Who Are The Hottest Growth Stocks Today?

1576,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is among the few stocks that are displaying mixed sentiments. While the company’s long-term strategies and earnings trend reflect strength, soft-margin trend keep us on the sidelines.Evidently, the company’s shares have declined 6% in the last three months against the industry’s increase of 0.3%. The fall is mainly attributed to strained margins, witnessed in the last few quarters. Notably, first-quarter 2018 was the second straight quarter of recording a negative gross margin and the fourth consecutive quarter of witnessing a decline in the operating margin. Gross margin declined 40 basis points (bps) in both first-quarter 2018 and fourth-quarter 2017. Meanwhile, the company recorded operating margin decline of 20 bps in first-quarter 2018, preceded by contraction of 190 bps, 160 bps and 10 bps, respectively, in the fourth, third and second quarters of 2017.  Increased raw material and packaging costs, as well as higher SG&A expenses impacted margins.However, gains from cost-saving initiatives under the funding-the-growth and the 2012 Restructuring Program partly offset the decline. Let’s analyze the factors that can help turnaround this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s performance.Strategies Capable of Supporting GrowthColgate is on track with its savings programs — the Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program, and the funding-the-growth initiative. Acknowledging the success of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, on Oct 26, the company’s board approved an expansion and extension of the program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. The company expects after-tax savings of $500-$575 million from the program. The projected savings target a three to four year average cash payback, with an after-tax rate of return above 30%.The four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs to improve gross and operating profits, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.On the other hand, by the funding-the-growth initiative, the company aims at opening environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers while also reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Additionally, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. This has enabled it to capture market share across all regions and categories. With regards to innovation, the company is rolling out the Naturals range in various markets. It has managed to tailor the Naturals’ offerings in each of its major markets. On a year-to-date basis, through Apr 27, the company’s global market share in the manual toothbrush and toothpaste businesses reached 32.5% and 42.4%, respectively.Decent Earnings Trend & Bullish OutlookColgate, which is known for its meet or beat history, delivered an earnings beat in first-quarter 2018, after three consecutive quarters of in-line earnings. Results continue to be driven by solid sales and significant market share gains. The company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives in the future. Consequently, it expects net sales to increase in mid-single-digit in 2018 while organic sales are likely to grow in a low to mid-single digit. Further, the company anticipates witnessing sequential improvement in organic sales through the rest of the year.Bottom LineWhile the soft-margin trend remains a concern in the near term, we believe that Colgate is poised for growth in the long term, supported by its growth strategies. Further, its innovation strategy is likely to enhance market share across the globe.Looking for Promising Bets? Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Kirin Holdings Co.

1579,CL,"Investors in Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 8, 2018 $67.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Colgate-Palmolive shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Colgate-Palmolive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry that ranks in the Bottom 9% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 80 cents per share to 79 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Colgate-Palmolive right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1580,CL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Colgate Beats on Q1 Earnings, Sales MissColgate-Palmolive Co. posted adjusted earnings of 74 cents a share in first-quarter 2018, up 10.4% from the prior-year quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Including one-time items, earnings were 72 cents a share compared with 64 cents reported in the year-ago period.Total sales of $4,002 million improved 6.5% from the year-ago period but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,018 million. The top line gained from 2% increase in global unit volumes and 4.5% favorable currency impact while the pricing remained flat. During the reported quarter, unit-volume growth included a 0.5% contribution from recently-acquired professional skin care businesses. However, the sales lag can be attributed to soft category growth across many markets.On an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales advanced 1.5%, which was below expectations. Lower organic sales resulted from flat unit-volume growth in emerging markets. However, unit volume improved 4.5% and organic volumes were up 3% in developed markets, driven by strength in North America and Europe.Deeper InsightAdjusted gross profit margin of 60.3% contracted 40 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher raw- and packaging-material expenses. However, this was partially offset by gains from the cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth program.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $1,007 million increased 5% while the adjusted operating margin contracting 20 bps to 25.2%. Operating margin decline can be attributed to lower gross margin, partly negated by 30 bps decline in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.5%. Further, the company continued with its leadership in the global toothpaste market with 42.4% market share year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (21% of total sales) improved 9%, reflecting a 9% increase in unit volumes and 0.5% favorable currency impacts, offset by 0.5% fall in pricing. On an organic basis, sales increased 5% while unit volume grew 5.5%.Latin America net sales (23% of total sales) inched up 0.5% year over year, driven by 0.5% increase in pricing. However, unit volume and currency remained flat year over year. During the quarter, volume growth in Brazil was negated by soft volumes in Mexico. On an organic basis, sales increased 0.5% as well.Europe net sales (16% of total sales) rose 16% year over year, due to 4% increase in unit volumes and a favorable currency impact of 14.5%, offset by 2.5% decline in pricing. Unit volumes gained from strength in France and Italy. Organic sales in Europe were up 1.5%.Asia Pacific net sales (19% of total sales) rose 5.5%, attributable to 0.5% increase in unit volume and positive currency impacts of 5.5%, partly compensated by 0.5% lower pricing. Volumes benefited from strength in India and the Philippines, which was partly neutralized by declines in the Greater China and Australia. On an organic basis, sales for the Asia Pacific were flat.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) rose 3.5% year over year, fueled by 2.5% higher pricing and 4.5% gains from positive currency, partly offset by 3.5% drop in unit volumes. Lower volumes are attributed to the decline in South Africa. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 1%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. Results gained from 0.5% rise in unit volumes, 1% increase in pricing and 4% positive impact from currency. Volume gains in the United States, Brazil and Australia were offset by the fall in Japan. On an organic basis, sales rose 1.5%.Other Financial DetailsColgate ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $851 million and total debt of $6,709 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $616 million as of Mar 31, 2018.OutlookLooking into 2018, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging, due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. However, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. Consequently, it expects net sales to increase in mid-single-digit in 2018 while organic sales are likely to grow in a low to mid-single-digit. Further, the company anticipates witnessing sequential improvement in organic sales through the rest of the year.Including the impact of the expanded Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the company continues to expect gross margin growth in 2018 along with double-digits increase in GAAP earnings per share.Excluding the restructuring charges, resulting from the program and other one-time expenses associated with U.S. tax reform in 2017, the company projects strong cash flow generation, gross margin expansion and higher advertising investments in 2018. Further, it anticipates low double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the year, on an adjusted basis.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and Consensus Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and Consensus | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, CL has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, CL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1581,CL,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This provider of nutrition and weight management solutions has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 28.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Factors Impacting the QuarterHerbalife remains dedicated toward implementing new technologies and making advancements in the digital space. This is evident from its recently inked deal with Salesforce, which is likely to bring various CRM capacities to Herbalife’s distributors and customers. Moreover, the company remains focused on undertaking innovations in order to align with the changing needs of customers. Incidentally, it launched more than 70 products globally during the fourth quarter. We believe that such efforts are likely to bear a positive impact the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2018.Well, such endeavors to enhance performance, combined with an impressive earnings history have buoyed investor optimism on the stock. Evidently, the stock rallied 67.5% over the past year, in comparison with the industry’s decline of 17.8%. However, Herbalife has been battling soft volumes due to stringent FTC regulations in the United States, which has been marring sales in the North American region. Further, volumes have been weak in the Mexico region, stemming from the impact of earthquakes in 2017. Owing to such headwinds, sales volumes in the North American and Mexico regions tumbled 7.3% and 8.4% respectively, during fourth-quarter 2017. As a result, overall, volume points slid 1.8% to 1.3 billion in the last reported quarter. Such adverse conditions are likely to persist in the aforementioned markets and consequently drag overall performance.That said, lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model as well as expectations for the upcoming quarterly announcement.Which Way are Estimates Moving?The company expects adjusted earnings per share to range from 90 cents to $1.10. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.07, which shows a 13.7% decline from $1.24 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days.Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. QuoteHowever, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to climb 1.6% year over year to $1,120 million.

1582,CL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This provider of branded food products delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter, though it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Pinnacle Foods this time around.Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods Inc. Quote Can Revenue-Driving Initiatives Offset Hurdles?Pinnacle Foods should continue gaining from its focus on acquisitions, innovations and robust brand portfolio. Well, the company has a solid customer reach, as its products can be found in over 85% U.S. households. Pinnacle Foods has been undertaking constant innovations to maintain market share. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits, Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles. The company also revealed plans to roll out new products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expand its Hungry-Man Handful line in 2018, which may benefit the quarter to be reported. These factors, along with improved pricing and contributions from its Duncan Hines Grocery and Birds Eye Frozen businesses fueled its top line in the last reported quarter, wherein the company delivered a solid in-market performance. Moreover, the quarter marked Pinnacle Foods’ 15th straight quarter of market share growth.However, sales were somewhat by exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) products, shut down of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales. Weakness in underlying sales resulted from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume/mix. Well, AJ exit and underlying sales decline was a major drag for the Specialty Foods segment in particular, as sales here tumbled almost 10% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume/mix stemming from the company’s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business. Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Specialty Foods to fall 9.1% to $80 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Birds Eye Frozen (or Frozen) and Duncan Hines Grocery (or Grocery) segments are pegged at $319 million and $260 million, respectively, in comparison with $321 million and $259 million. The consensus mark for sales at Boulder Brands, which is likely to be hurt by shut down of Boulder UK operations, stands at $103 million.Though net sales in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to gain from early Easter, overall top line looks somewhat pressurized from the aforementioned hurdles. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at $763 million, reflecting a decline from $766 million reported in the year-ago period.Cost-Savings Efforts vs. Input Cost InflationPinnacle Foods has been battling elevated costs owing to increased packaging and logistics costs. This, along with unfavorable impacts of product mix, increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from the AJ exit remained a drag on gross margin in the last reported quarter. Also, management had earlier projected input cost inflation for 2018 in the range of 3.8-4.2%, with greater inflationary pressure in the first half of the year. This raises concerns over Pinnacle Foods’ upcoming earnings. Nevertheless, we commend the company’s solid productivity initiatives aimed at generating savings and improving gross margin. To this end, the company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. On account of such efforts combined with acquisition synergies and benefits from the network optimization program, the company expects productivity for 2018 in the range of 4-4.5% of cost of products sold. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost gross margin, including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending and realizing synergies from acquisitions. It looks like these dedicated endeavors will help the company tide over all aforementioned hurdles and deliver bottom-line growth.The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 56 cents, which marks an improvement of 12% from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. However, this estimate has dropped by a notch over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1583,CL,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1584,CL,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 2. The company has an impressive earnings history, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the past five quarters.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the company’s earnings announcement. The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Clorox Company QuoteFactors at PlayWe note that Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue in the forthcoming period. Margin was strained due to escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments for growth and cost savings initiatives, which might continue to increase expenses and hurt profitability in the quarter to be reported. Meanwhile, intense competition from well-established players in the consumer products industry remains a cause for concern.In the past three months, shares of Clorox have lost 17.5%, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.6%.However, Clorox remains committed toward brand management and improvement in margins through cost saving and productivity initiatives. Also, it makes strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities both in the physical world and online. Recently, management has agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. The deal is expected to expand Clorox's dietary supplements business, thereby accelerating growth of its top brands in the fast-growing categories, alongside focusing on health and wellness. Additionally, it remains well on track with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share.These tailwinds might contribute to the company’s top line and boost profitability. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues to come in at $1.51 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.In the light of these above-mentioned factors, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Clorox in third-quarter fiscal 2018.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.94% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat in the ensuing quarter.As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1585,CL,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This consumer goods behemoth has surpassed earnings estimates for five consecutive quarters now, courtesy of its robust international presence, solid organic sales trend and focus on buyouts. However, the company is plagued by escalated expenses, which remain a threat to margins. So, let’s see if Church & Dwight can keep its splendid surprise streak alive this time around as well. Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Quote International Business: A Major StrengthWe expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its international business, which has been a growth driver over the past few years. In fourth-quarter 2017, organic sales in the international segment jumped 5.8%, courtesy of higher volumes. Further, overall international sales surged 33.3%, receiving considerable impetus from STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets. Well, international sales have also been contributing strongly to the company’s organic sales growth. Thus, the company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth, as evident from its considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China. Also, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business and expects its international operations to remain strong,Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Consumer International to surge 20.3% to $172 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Consumer Domestic and Specialty Products segments are pegged at $728 million and $78 million, respectively, in comparison with $660 million and $74 million reported in the year-ago period.Other DriversChurch & Dwight is also likely to continue witnessing organic sales growth, which has long been backed by the company’s solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in the first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter, organic sales growth was driven by higher volumes and better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow 3%, which also gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company expects organic sales growth of 2%.Apart from these factors, Church & Dwight has been benefiting from its focus on acquisitions. The company started with only one brand, i.e. ARM & HAMMER and since then has acquired a number of brands which are generally number-one or number-two brands with high margin. These businesses are likely to have boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004, to reach $4 billion in 2018. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter and is on track with its integration.Considering all aforementioned factors, management projects first-quarter reported sales growth to be 11% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $979 million, up 11.6% from $877 million recorded in the year-ago period.Will Cost Woes be Offset?However, Church & Dwight continues to battle increased commodity and transportation costs. Management expects these headwinds to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Further, the company plans to increase marketing expenditure, while it also expects SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales) to increase, owing to intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A from recent acquisitions. This may impact the operating margin.Nevertheless, it looks like the company expects strength of its international business and revenue-driving initiatives to compensate for these obstacles, as it envisions adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents for the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.3% (on an adjusted basis). This also falls in line with the Zacks consensus estimate that has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Church & Dwight carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with its Earnings ESP of +0.52%, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +11.31%.

1586,CL,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Including one-time items, earnings were 72 cents a share compared with 64 cents reported in the year-ago period.Total sales of $4,002 million improved 6.5% from the year-ago period but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,018 million. The top line gained from 2% increase in global unit volumes and 4.5% favorable currency impact while the pricing remained flat. During the reported quarter, unit-volume growth included a 0.5% contribution from recently-acquired professional skin care businesses. However, the sales lag can be attributed to soft category growth across many markets.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteOn an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales advanced 1.5%, which was below expectations. Lower organic sales resulted from flat unit-volume growth in emerging markets. However, unit volume improved 4.5% and organic volumes were up 3% in developed markets, driven by strength in North America and Europe.Following the earnings release, Colgate’s shares declined 3.9% in the pre-market trading hours. Though the Colgate stock fell 3.8% in the last six months, it outperformed the broader industry’s decline of 8.3%.Deeper InsightAdjusted gross profit margin of 60.3% contracted 40 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher raw- and packaging-material expenses. However, this was partially offset by gains from the cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth program.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $1,007 million increased 5% while the adjusted operating margin contracting 20 bps to 25.2%. Operating margin decline can be attributed to lower gross margin, partly negated by 30 bps decline in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.5%. Further, the company continued with its leadership in the global toothpaste market with 42.4% market share year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (21% of total sales) improved 9%, reflecting a 9% increase in unit volumes and 0.5% favorable currency impacts, offset by 0.5% fall in pricing.

On an organic basis, sales increased 0.5% as well.Europe net sales (16% of total sales) rose 16% year over year, due to 4% increase in unit volumes and a favorable currency impact of 14.5%, offset by 2.5% decline in pricing. Unit volumes gained from strength in France and Italy. Organic sales in Europe were up 1.5%.Asia Pacific net sales (19% of total sales) rose 5.5%, attributable to 0.5% increase in unit volume and positive currency impacts of 5.5%, partly compensated by 0.5% lower pricing. Volumes benefited from strength in India and the Philippines, which was partly neutralized by declines in the Greater China and Australia. On an organic basis, sales for the Asia Pacific were flat.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) rose 3.5% year over year, fueled by 2.5% higher pricing and 4.5% gains from positive currency, partly offset by 3.5% drop in unit volumes. Lower volumes are attributed to the decline in South Africa. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 1%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $616 million as of Mar 31, 2018.OutlookLooking into 2018, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging, due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. However, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. Consequently, it expects net sales to increase in mid-single-digit in 2018 while organic sales are likely to grow in a low to mid-single-digit. Further, the company anticipates witnessing sequential improvement in organic sales through the rest of the year.Including the impact of the expanded Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the company continues to expect gross margin growth in 2018 along with double-digits increase in GAAP earnings per share.Excluding the restructuring charges, resulting from the program and other one-time expenses associated with U.S. tax reform in 2017, the company projects strong cash flow generation, gross margin expansion and higher advertising investments in 2018. Further, it anticipates low double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the year, on an adjusted basis.Zacks Rank & Key PicksColgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1589,CL,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. This global brewer has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Molson Coors this time around. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise   Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterWe expect Molson Coors to continue gaining from its solid focus on cost savings, which have been driving year-over-year growth at its bottom line for nearly a year now. Notably, the company has been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability. These initiatives include closure of underperforming breweries, improving efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources and reducing labor and general overhead costs. Also, the company has been focusing on improving supply chain network and building on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources to invest in brand building and innovation. These endeavors helped Molson Coors generate cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017 that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, management raised its three-year savings goal (up to 2019) to $600 million, which is likely to help the company expand its EBITDA margins. These dedicated efforts give out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well.However, input cost inflation remains a concern, as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. Incidentally, for 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across all segments, except International. These factors may act as hurdles in the company’s upcoming release.Can Molson Coors Cheer Investors? Molson Coors’ top line has been gaining from focus on strengthening brand portfolio. Armed with a robust portfolio of well-established brands, the company has been steadily progressing with growth of its above-premium segment. Impressively, the company has also been gaining share in the premium light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands. We believe the company’s shift of focus on expanding the above premium category along with solid innovation program is likely to positively impact the upcoming quarter.However, we remain cautious about the company’s U.S. volumes, which remained soft and ended up hurting Molson Coors’ overall worldwide brand volume as well as its financial volumes in the last reported quarter. In fact, Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time owing to tough industry conditions. Consumers’ changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the decline.A Look Back & Expectations for Q1Molson Coors ended 2017 on a superb note as in the fourth quarter, both the top and bottom line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were backed by sales growth in most regions (except United States), favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, greater royalty volumes, cost-saving benefits, MG&A efficiencies and cycling of indirect tax provision. However, the U.S. region continued with its dull volumes, as it witnessed a decline in both sales-to-retailers (STRs) volume and sales-to-wholesalers’ volume, which fell 3% and 1.5%, respectively. These factors pose concerns over the company’s top line for the quarter to be reported.For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales in Central Europe to dip 1.8% year over year to $375 million. The consensus marks for net sales in Canada and International is pegged at $288 million and $66 million, compared to $291 million and $62 million reported in the year-ago period respectively. Also, the consensus estimate for U.S. sales stands at $1,734 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall revenues is $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million recorded in the year-ago period.Nevertheless, management remained impressed with its performance amid the tough market conditions. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms and focus on First Choice, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors prospects. Well, underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range 18-22%, which is considerably low and also makes us hopeful about first-quarter earnings. The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that Molson Coors is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Molson Coors Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21% makes us less confident about earnings beat. In fact, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

1590,CL,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for TreeHouse Foods this time around. TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Quote Headwinds Looming Over TreeHouse FoodsTreeHouse Foods’ last reported results marked its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in earnings and sales. The company has been bearing the brunt of pricing pressure stemming from stiff competition in the grocery industry. This, along with commodity cost inflation and rising freight costs has been marring TreeHouse Foods’ DOI margin for a while now.These factors were reflected in the fourth quarter, wherein earnings bore the brunt of soft sales and margins, whereas revenues were marred by divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business. Divestiture of SIF business led to reduced sales at Baked Goods and Meals segments. Further, intense industry competition pressurized pricing in most segments, while volume/mix also remained challenged in the Meals segment. Apart from this, higher freight and commodity costs weighed upon the company’s direct operating income (DOI) margin, which marked its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year contraction.Can Strategy for 2020 Provide Respite?The company remains on track with its TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan that was announced in second-quarter 2017. The plan was designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Alongside of cost savings, the initiative is expected to manage the company’s portfolio and optimize production and supply chain.  TreeHouse 2020 aims to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020, by undertaking complete business integration and expense reduction.However, it looks like these efforts will take time to offset the hurdles completely. Unfortunately, management expects input cost inflation to remain a headwind in 2018, wherein freight costs are also expected to be a major deterrent. These hiccups also weighed on management’s guidance for the first quarter. Earnings for the first quarter are expected in the range of 10-20 cents per share, which shows a year-over-year decline due to soft volumes, operational inefficiencies, and the unfavorable timing of elevated commodity and freight costs with respect to pricing.The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to slump 77.1% year over year to 14 cents. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1,427 million, down from $1,536 million recorded in the year-ago period.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that TreeHouse Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Even though TreeHouse Foods has an Earnings ESP of +1.03%, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into earnings announcements.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

1591,CL,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after the closing bell.The company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. However, it delivered an average positive surprise of 45.9%. Notably, the company has been losing its position, lately, due to a dismal surprise trend for both top and bottom lines.  It has delivered negative earnings surprise in five of the preceding six quarters. Moreover, revenues lagged estimates in three of the last four quarters.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether or not FEMSA will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 55 cents, which moved up 2 cents in the last seven days. Further, the estimate for the quarter reflects 12.2% growth year over year. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6.12 billion, representing rise of 13.1% from the year-ago quarter.Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteFactors Likely to Impact the QuarterWe remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures, including expanding store base, diversifying business portfolio and focus on core business activities. Evidently, the company has been taking prudent steps to diversify its product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bode well for future operating performance.Moreover, its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions looks good. The company’s exposure in various industries, including beverage, beer and retail, gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. In fact, the company’s strong cash flow generation capacity enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion.These attributes have helped the stock gain 8.1% in the past month, outperforming 0.3% growth recorded by the industry. This reflects a positive sentiment on the stock ahead of earnings. However, we cannot ignore the near-term headwinds that may bother the stock’s growth. These mainly include the dismal top- and bottom-line trends, as well as the continued decline in margins.So, let’s see if FEMSA’s upcoming quarterly performance can help it break the dismal earnings surprise trend backed by its strategic endeavors.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that FEMSA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While FEMSA has a Zacks Rank #3, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1592,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Colgate has been popular with investors for its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, it delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. Moreover, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 0.38% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 73 cents, which reflects growth of nearly 9% from the year-ago period. However, the earnings estimate has declined by a penny in the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.01 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteFactors Driving This Quarter’s ResultsColgate is encouraged by the smooth progress on its savings plan. Further, it is progressing well with its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. It remains confident of the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives, which are likely to boost results in 2018.Consequently, the company expects net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth in low- to mid-single digit this year. The company anticipates strong volumes and pricing growth in 2018. Further, it projects gross margin to expand, driven by robust pricing and productivity gains from the funding-the-growth initiatives. These factors, along with benefits from the tax reform, are expected to boost GAAP earnings in double-digits, while adjusted earnings are anticipated to increase nearly 10%.However, Colgate has been witnessing strained margins, of late, due to higher raw material and packaging costs, as well as advertising expenses. Though the company expects improved adjusted gross margin in 2018, it anticipates advertising costs to remain high, which might hurt the operating margin. Moreover, it expects the backdrop to remain challenging in 2018.Given the mixed sentiment, the company’s shares have declined 10.5%, year to date. However, this compares favorably to the industry’s decline of 12.4%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.69%.

1593,CL,"Wall Street apparently stuttered to start 2018 with key equity gauges like the S&P 500 losing about 2.6%, Dow Jones shedding 3.5% and the Nasdaq composite adding barely 0.7% in the first quarter (as of Mar 28, 2018).In any case, the first quarter is mostly downbeat every year with freezing cold locking people inside and economic productivity slacking. This year, GDP for Q1 is expected to be around 1.8% from 2.9% registered in Q4 of 2017.Still, worries that especially stumped investors in Q 1 were increased inflationary expectations, chances of faster Fed rate hikes and the resultant uptick in the Treasury bond yields, Trump’s announcement of import tariffs and the associated possibilities of trade war, and a rout in tech stocks. However, the long-avoided and most-discussed commodity oil behaved nicely in the quarter.Against such a faltering backdrop, we would likely to note which sectors stood tall in Q1 and which ones failed. We have also picked two stock winners and losers from each sector.Winners BiotechThe biotech sector stayed steady in the quarteron expectations of an increase in M&A activity. Ebbing tensions over the price gouging issue, hopes of easing regulation, positive clinical trials, FDA approvals of drugs and success in the immune-oncology field also spurred the rally. Biotech fund Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) added 20% in the last three months (as of Mar 28, 2018).Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) – Up 184.5% -- Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Pfenex Inc. (PFNX  -  Free Report) –Up 127.1% -- Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Information Technology The technology sector has been through peaks and troughs in Q1. The sector, which started off 2018 on solid note helped by emerging technologies, tumbled in March on a host of issues like Facebook’s data breaches, massacre with Nvidia’s self-driving car tests and short selling pressure in Twitter. Still, PowerShares NASDAQ Internet ETF (PNQI  -  Free Report) advanced 7.3% in the quarter.ACM Research Inc. ACMR – Up 129.4% -- Zacks Rank #3Mulesoft Inc. MULE – Up 85.0% -- Zacks Rank #3Aerospace & Defense The sector is benefiting from higher commercial demand, geopolitical risks, rise in defense spending in other countries, lower energy prices and a Trump bump. In March, lawmakers revealed a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill, which includes the most substantial hike in defense funding in the past 15 years. Nearly $80 billion increase was announced in the latest defense spending, which helped defense stocks in the quarter. PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report) was up 3.4% in Q1 (as of Mar 28, 2018).Wesco Aircraft Holdings Inc. (WAIR  -  Free Report) – Up 37.33% -- Zacks Rank #2Heico Corporation (HEI  -  Free Report) – Up 17.5% -- Zacks Rank #3Losers Energy Though oil prices gained ground in Q1 as evident from 8.9% gains in United States Oil (USO  -  Free Report), the broader energy sector, marked by Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE  -  Free Report), continued to see a decline. XLE was down about 8.3% in Q1.W2 Energy Inc. AEPT – Down 79.33% -- Zacks Rank #3Petroquest Energy Inc  – Down 59.27% -- Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)Consumer StaplesDue to rising rate concerns, the apparently safe sector could not stand out in Q1 despite the market selloff. Plus, subdued wage growth as evident from the latest job report and inflationary pressure may have weighed on this consumer-driven sector. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP  -  Free Report) retreated about 7.6% in the first quarter.Blue Apron Holdings Inc. APRN – Down 51.8% -- Zacks Rank #2Calyxt Inc. CLXT – Down 40.9% -- Zacks Rank #3Real EstateThe sector underperforms in a rising rate environment. Yield-hungry investors normally have a large appetite for REIT stocks as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. As a result, in a rising rate environment, the appeal for this yield gets quelled. Plus, dependence of REITs on debt for their operations makes these a losing proposition in an era when the Fed is deemed to hike rates faster. Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ  -  Free Report) dropped about 8% in the first quarter.NorthStar Asset Management Group, Inc. CLNS – Down 50.6% -- Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)Five Oaks Investment Corp. OAKS – Down 27.1% -- Zacks Rank #3Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

Additionally, the company has been consistently increasing dividend rate every year since 2001. Keeping up with the trend, Colgate increased quarterly dividend by 5% to 42 cents from the previous payout of 40 cents per share. Effective second-quarter 2018, this will bring the company’s annualized dividend to $1.68 per share. The new dividend will be paid on May 15, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Apr 20.On Jan 11, 2018, Colgate declared its first-quarter cash dividend of 40 cents per share, paid on Feb 15.In fact, the company has to its credit a robust history of rewarding shareholders with regular quarterly dividend payouts since 1895. Since then, Colgate has paid dividends every quarter, even amid economic crises like the Great Depression of the 1930s, stagflation in the 1970s and the recession of 2008.However, following the latest dividend hike not much movement was noticed in the company’s share price yesterday. In the past three months, the stock has lost 4.8%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 8.8%.Notably, dividend hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. In fact, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it. Now, it remains to be seen whether this recent hike will help Colgate in regaining the lost momentum.Prior to the current dividend hike, management had raised quarterly dividend by 3% to 40 cents per share versus 39 cents, in March 2017. Apart from highlighting commitment toward creating shareholder value, regular dividend payments and increments, reflect the company’s potential to enhance earnings and cash flow generation capabilities. Evidently, in 2017, the company returned about $2.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which marked a year-over-year increase of nearly 3%. Also, this leading manufacturer of consumer products generated $3,054 million of cash from operations in and deployed $553 million toward capital expenditures the same time period.Apart from Colgate, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) remain keen on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and regular dividend payments. Recently, these companies have also declared dividend hikes.Archer Daniels raised its dividend by 4.7% to 33.5 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 13, 2018. Home Depot declared a 15.7% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.03 per share, payable on Mar 22. DICK'S Sporting Goods approved a quarterly dividend hike of nearly 32% to 22.50 cents per share, payable on Mar 30.Colgate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1595,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has been gaining on the recent progress of its savings program. Moreover, the company remains well poised with innovation, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. However, strained margins remain a threat.Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Robust Savings Plan: A Key ToolColgate remains optimistic about its Global Growth and Efficiency Program as well as Funding the Growth undertakings, which are delivering impressive results. Also, the company has extended its Global Growth and Efficiency Program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million compared with $425-$475 million projected earlier.In fact, Colgate’s four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program will help the company to improve gross and operating profit and enhance its market share position worldwide. By funding the growth initiative, the company intends to open new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, besides reducing fuel and transportation costs. The aforementioned endeavors are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Innovation Aids GrowthColgate has been undertaking innovation and in-store implementation, as a key component of its growth strategies, over many years. This has enabled the company to capture the market share across all regions and categories. On the innovation front, it is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. Colgate has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets as well.Decent Earnings Trend & Bullish OutlookColgate has delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, this marked the company’s fifth in-line earnings in the last six quarters. Results can be attributed to solid sales and significant market share gains. Going forward, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives.Following the results, Colgate provided a bullish outlook for 2018. The company now anticipates net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth of low to mid-single digit. Also, including benefits from the tax reform, GAAP earnings are envisioned to improve in the double-digits range while adjusted earnings are anticipated to be up nearly 10%.Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Colgate, it is currently plagued with strained margins for the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company faced increased raw material and packaging costs as well as higher advertising expenses, thus creating pressure on margins.Looking ahead, the company expects adjusted gross margin to expand 50-70 bps in 2018. However, it also expects to incur higher advertising expenses, which is likely to weigh upon operating margins. In addition, Colgate anticipates the challenging backdrop to persist due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide.Consequently, shares of Colgate have lost 2.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Nevertheless, Colgate’s robust savings program, innovations, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth.Looking for More Promising Bets?

1596,CL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 9.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Colgate's Q4 Earnings In Line, Sales LagColgate-Palmolive Co. posted adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share in fourth-quarter 2017, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and flat with the prior-year quarter. Including one-time items, earnings came in at 37 cents a share compared with 68 cents reported in the year-ago period.Total sales of $3,892 million improved 4.5% from the year-ago period but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,916 million. The top line gained from 3% increase in global unit volumes and favorable currency impact of 2.5%, offset by 1% decline in pricing. Further, strong volume gains in Latin America, North America and Europe aided sales growth.On an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales jumped 2%.Deeper InsightAdjusted gross profit margin of 60.4% contracted 40 bps from the prior-year quarter driven by higher raw and packaging material expenses and lower pricing. However, this was partially offset by gains from the cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth program.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $1,011 million dipped 3%, with the adjusted operating margin contracting 190 bps to 26%. Operating margin decline can be attributed to 160 bps rise in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, which included higher investments in advertising.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.6%. Further, the company continued with its leadership in the global toothpaste market with 43.3% market share year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (21% of total sales) rose 1%, reflecting a 4.5% increase in unit volumes offset by 3.5% fall in pricing. However, currency impacts were flat with last year. On an organic basis too, sales improved 1%.Latin America net sales (25% of total sales) jumped 4% year over year gaining from 4% volume gains and positive currency impact of 1.5%, partly negated by 1.5% decline in pricing. Volume growth can mainly be attributed to increase in Brazil and the Southern Cone and Andean regions, partially mitigated by lower volumes in Mexico and Central America. On an organic basis, sales increased 2.5%.Europe net sales (16% of total sales) rose 13% year over year, due to 6% increase in unit volumes and a favorable currency impact of 9%, offset by 2% decline in pricing. Unit volumes gained from strength in France, Italy and Germany. Europe organic sales were up 4%.Asia Pacific net sales (17% of total sales) rose 6%, attributable to 1% increase in unit volume, 1.5% higher pricing and positive currency impacts of 3.5%. Volumes in the quarter benefited from strength in India, which was partly neutralized by declines in the Greater China and the Philippines regions. On an organic basis, sales for Asia Pacific were up 2.5%.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) jumped 2% year over year, fueled by 2.5% gains from positive currency, partly offset by 0.5% drop in unit volumes while pricing was flat. Lower volumes in the Sub-Turkey and the North Africa/Middle East regions, were partly offset by gains in Russia and the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 0.5%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter. Results gained from 0.5% increase in pricing and 2% positive impact from currency, while unit volumes remained flat.

Net cash provided by operating activities came in at $3,054 million 2017.OutlookLooking into 2018, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. However, the company remains on track with its brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. Consequently, the company expects net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range, while organic sales growth of low to mid-single-digit is likely in 2018.Including the impact of the expanded Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the company continues to expect gross margin expansion for 2018, along with double digits increase in GAAP earnings per share.Excluding the restructuring charges resulting from the program and other one-time expenses associated with U.S. tax reform in 2017, the company projects strong cash flow generation, gross margin expansion and higher advertising investments in 2018. Further, the company anticipates low double digit earnings per share growth for the year, on an adjusted basis.Accounting for the U.S. tax reform, the company anticipates 2018 tax of 26-27%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

1597,CL,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.87%.This consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.72%.Factors to ConsiderProcter & Gamble has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries. Overall, the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes.That said, this conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales.Although the company did not provide any sales guidance for the fiscal second quarter, Procter & Gamble remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018. Its innovation-led products like premium Olay and SK-II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Procter & Gamble anticipates 3% growth in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected in the range of 2-3% (read more: Will New Products Lift Procter & Gamble's Q2 Sales?).Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17.34 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 4.1%. Revenues of the company are likely to increase 2.9% year-over-year.Despite muted sales growth, the company has exceeded analysts’ expectations for the 10th consecutive quarter. Procter & Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost-saving plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last two reported quarters, as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Then again, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. The trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs that have heightened further by the recent hurricanes. The company expects higher commodity costs, including pulp, kerosene, ethylene, and propylene, to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category is likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings and share repurchases will partly offset these woes (read more: How Procter & Gamble's Margins Will Shape Up in Q2).For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a growth of 6.5% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Procter & Gamble has the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Procter & Gamble is +0.87%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1598,CL,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents for the quarter under review moved south by 3 cents in the last seven days and reflects a decline of 6.7% year over year.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has been struggling with a dismal surprise history for quite a long time. In fact, the company has lagged sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14,965 million, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprises in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.In the previous quarter, the company’s margins remained under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Oilseeds Processing segment. Despite robust crush volumes and persistent growth in demand, results were hurt by soft crush margins and lower South American origination margins. These factors also hampered Crushing and Origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results affected Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations.However, Archer Daniels’ solid focus on cost savings to strengthen business is commendable. It remains focused on cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG&A. Furthermore, the company’s Project Readiness program that aims at enhancing operational efficiency at production and supply chain networks to curtail costs bodes well. Management has also been on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program.In March, management realigned its business into four segments namely Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination, to accelerate growth and resonate well with changing customers’ needs. These changes will be reflected in first-quarter 2018 results. The new business segments are expected to clearly differentiate the company’s product and service offerings, while justifying its operating structure. Additionally, the segments should help Archer Daniels provide value-added and exclusive product assortments, hence boost growth across its business portfolio. These efforts, in turn, are likely to add stimulus to the company’s performance and profitability.Given the major strengths and weaknesses, let’s wait and see what lies ahead for Archer Daniels when it reports quarterly results.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of earnings beat. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of -7.47% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1602,CL,"We expect Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 26.The company has posted in-line earnings in three of the trailing four quarters. Moreover, the company beat its nearly four-year long trend of missing Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 75 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period figure. Also, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,921 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteColgate has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting optimism building on the stock recently. The company’s shares have surged 3.1%, compared with industry’s growth of 1%.Factors Driving this QuarterColgate is encouraged by the progress on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. The company’s board on Oct 26 approved an expansion and extension of the program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million, compared with $425-$475 million estimated earlier. The projected savings target a three to four year average cash payback, with an after-tax rate of return above 30%.Moreover, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years, enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. The company is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. It has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets. For example, the brand will be interpreted differently in India and China. Moreover, the company anticipates growing market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.However, the company’s margins continue to be strained due to increased raw material and packaging costs, as well as higher advertising expenses. Further, it anticipates these costs to persist and impact margins in 2017. Additionally, management has perked up costs guidance related to charges arising from the expansion and extension of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%. This along with the company’s Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1603,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report), a global dealer in consumer goods, came out with third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share, which came in line with Zacks Consensus Estimate and remained flat year over year.For 2017, the company reiterated its adjusted earnings per share to grow at a low-single-digit range on a year over year basis. However, GAAP earnings per share are still expected to drop at a mid single-digit rate.Earnings Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has moved up by a penny in the past 30 days. Further, if we look at Colgate’s performance in the trailing four quarters (excluding the quarter under review), the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 0.4%.Revenues: Colgate’s sales increased 3% to $3,974 million during the quarter, owing to 1.5% growth from both, volumes and favorable currency impact. However, pricing remained flat with the prior-year period. Organic sales rose 1.5% in the quarter. Notably, sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,930 million, thus breaking its long dismal surprise trend.Depending upon the current spot rates, management continues to anticipate both, net sales and organic sales for 2017 to rise in low-single-digits.Zacks Rank: Currently, Colgate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is subject to change based on the just released earnings results.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stock Movement: Colgate’s shares dipped nearly 1.9% during pre-market trading hours following the earnings release.Check back later for our full write up on Colgate’s earnings report!Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1604,CL,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the closing bell.The company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 19.4%. Therefore, the question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether FEMSA will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.27, which has moved up by 6 cents in the last 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,359 million, representing growth of more than 18% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, FEMSA forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. As of Oct 20 Earnings Preview, the Consumer Staples sector’s earnings and revenues are expected to grow 1.8% each.Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterFEMSA has been grappling with soft margins for more than a year now. This can be attributed to strained margins at Coca-Cola FEMSA and growth of lower-margin businesses at FEMSA Comercio. Additionally, higher operating expenses at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio’s Health division weighed upon the company’s operating margin in the last reported quarter. Also, operating margin declined across all of the company’s segments in second-quarter 2017, barring FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division. In fact, margins were hurt by the consolidation of Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results in the Philippines as well.Further, FEMSA has been facing difficult times due to currency headwinds, which has been weighing on Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results for a while now. We believe the continuation of these trends will impact the future results.Consequently, FEMSA’s shares have lost 11.7% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.2%.While these factors pose concern about the company’s upcoming performance, we remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures. These measures include increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. Evidently, FEMSA has been taking prudent steps to diversify its product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bodes well for future operating performance.Moreover, the company’s focus on achieving growth via acquisitions bode well. Furthermore, its exposure in various industries including beverage, beer and retail, gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. In fact, the company’s strong cash flow generation capacity enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion.So, let’s see if FEMSA’s upcoming quarterly performance can help it break the dismal earnings surprise trend backed by its strategic endeavors.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that FEMSA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1605,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has posted in-line earnings in three out of the past four quarters, though its top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nearly four years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise  Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 73 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period figure. Also, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,928 million, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Driving this QuarterColgate has been witnessing soft sales for quite some time now. While its dismal sales surprise history has already been highlighted above, we note that this global consumer goods big-wig hasn’t witnessed year-over-year sales growth for quite some time. On the contrary, the company’s bottom line has risen year over year for four straight quarters now, thanks to its robust cost-saving initiatives. Thus, the company’s shares have gained 13% so far this year, though it lagged the industry’s rally of 17%.Glimpse of Q2 & Estimates for Q3In the last quarter, Colgate’s sales dipped 0.5% as benefits of 1% increase in prices were offset by a 1% drop in global unit volumes and a negative impact of 0.5% from currency fluctuations. Further, sales were hurt by the persistent softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. However, this was somewhat offset by strong organic sales growth in Latin America and the return to positive organic sales growth in Hill’s Pet Nutrition. Also, better pricing and gains from the company’s funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program boosted the gross margin, alongside helping earnings jump 3% year over year.Notably, sales from Latin America constituted about 26% of Colgate’s total revenues, which is the highest among all regions. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales growth in this region is a marginal 0.1%, backed by a slight rise in organic sales and volumes. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North American sales growth is pegged at a dip of 0.01%. This fares better than a 3.5% decline in the previous quarter. For the company as a whole, the consensus estimate for sales growth is currently pegged at 0.02%, on organic sales increase of 0.02%. While the consensus estimate for volume growth is flat for the quarter to be reported, pricing is anticipated to have a positive impact of 0.01% on the top line — which in turn should fuel the bottom line growth.Robust Strategies to Drive the Bottom LineDuring the second-quarter conference call, management projected the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. Nevertheless, the company remains encouraged by the progress of its 2012 Restructuring Program and continues to pursue additional savings opportunities under the program. In this regard, the company stated that the additional opportunities identified in the second quarter provide visibility for reaching the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range. We believe that benefits from these initiatives and revenue contributions from Latin America should help drive Colgate’s bottom line in this quarter as well.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks Rank & ESP: Colgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Further, the company currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.50%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. The combination of Colgate’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Pinnacle Foods Inc.

1606,CL,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. In the preceding quarter, it missed the consensus mark by 0.7%. Therefore, the question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Kimberly-Clark will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteFactors Likely to Impact the QuarterKimberly-Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets for quite some time now. While performance improved in China, it softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, due to lower volumes and highly competitive promotional activity.Though management expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017, the current promotional environment is weakening the market dynamics.In 2017, management anticipates input costs to increase owing to modestly inflationary environment. Input cost inflation are expected to be higher in the range of $200-$300 million from its previous estimate of $150-$250 million. This uptick can be attributable to higher prices for several raw materials including pulp.Nevertheless, we note that the company’s higher cost savings, continued product innovation, strong international presence have been the catalysts that are expected to drive growth. For 2017, the company expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425 to $450 million from the FORCE program, up from the prior estimate of $400 million.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.54. Although the current-quarter estimate has moved down by a penny in the last seven days, it is couple of cents above from the prior-year quarter figure. The consensus estimate for revenue is currently pegged at $4,668 million for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.Expectations of an increase in both the top and bottom lines boost investor confidence about the stock’s performance in the quarter.Sales for Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional segments are projected to be $2,354 million, $1,490 million and $817 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year increase of 1.8%, 1.2% and 1.9% for each segment, respectively.Further, we note that volumes are estimated to increase 0.03% for both the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue segments, and 0.02% for the K-C Professional segment.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1607,CL,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.9%.In fact, Whirlpool has reported negative surprise in the last four quarters, with an average miss of 5.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.99, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8.9%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.5 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the broader industry in the past month. The company’s shares have increased 3.1%, while the industry dipped 10.5%.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s surprise history remains unimpressive as it posted fourth consecutive negative surprise in second-quarter 2017. Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect operating performance. This was clearly reflected in Whirlpool’s second-quarter results which were hurt by raw material cost inflation. The company notes that costs of key raw materials, particularly steel and resins have increased worldwide in the first half of 2017.While these headwinds were fully offset in North America and Latin America due to favorable demand and productivity gains, Europe and Asia suffered as soft demand made it difficult to negate the challenges.Not surprisingly, the company slashed  earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material costs and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. It now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $14.50-$15.00 per share compared with $14.7-$15.50, guided earlier.However, Whirlpool has been riding on its innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Moreover, the company's solid integration and cost-productivity activities have been enhancing performance. These factors, along with its robust brands portfolio, and continued strength across North America and Latin America have been growth drivers.While Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid brands portfolio reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of -5.90% as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.75 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 per share.

1608,CL,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) on Oct 16.In the past three months, Hormel Foods’ shares have lost nearly 4%, as against 9.3% growth recorded by the industry.  Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s earnings per share are expected to dip nearly 5.1% year over year for fiscal 2017, as against 29.3% growth estimated to be accrued from the industry.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock moved down for both fiscal 2017 and 2018, over the last 60 days, reflecting negative sentiments.Inside StoryHormel Foods had reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) results. Quarterly revenues and earnings missed the respective year-ago figures by 4.1% and 5.6%.The company noted that the top-line results primarily dipped year over year due to the dreary performance of the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. Fall in turkey prices, mounting competition and elevation in overall operating expenses have been weighing over this segment's results for the past two quarters.Hormel Foods also stated that turkey prices (especially turkey breast meat) dropped during the fiscal third quarter. The turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness any price hike in the upcoming quarters.On the other hand, operating cost of the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment has been escalating due to the poor yield accrued from certain plant operations and maintenance required for bio-security measures.In addition, intense competition has been putting pricing pressure on the Jennie-O Turkey Store business’ food service, retail and daily business chains.Hormel Foods mentioned that apart from the dismal Jennie-O Turkey Store segment’s performance, inflation in the prices of major inputs, such as pork bellies and beef trim, hurt the bottom-line results in the last reported quarter. The company expects that elevated costs of these inputs will continue to dent its profitability in the near term as well.Notably, the company trimmed its earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017 from the $1.65-$1.71 per share range to the $1.54-$1.58 per share range, due to the aforementioned issues.Furthermore, we believe a stronger U.S. dollar might mar Hormel Foods’ international revenues and margins, going ahead. Additionally, outbreak of livestock diseases is expected to give rise to sudden supply-chain challenges for the company going forward.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.  has an average positive earnings surprise of 3.64% for the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1609,CL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) posted mixed second-quarter 2017 results, wherein though the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, top line missed the same. Further, management reiterated full-year adjusted earnings guidance at the low end of its previously stated range.The company’s shares have declined nearly 2.1% yesterday, probably as investors were disappointed with the top line miss and the bleak earnings view. However, we note that the stock has rallied 4.5% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 1.2%. Nonetheless, the industry is placed at top 47% of the Zacks Classified industries (120 out of 256).Q2 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 53 cents per share rose 26.2% from the year-ago period, and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents by 1.9%. This was in line with the company’s robust earnings trend in recent quarters. Notably, the company has a track record of either meeting or beating earnings estimates,  much similar to Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) that  has maintained this trend for over seven years now, barring one quarter of negative earnings surprise in Jun 2015.Coming back to Pinnacle Foods, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in eight of the last 14 quarters and posted in-line results in the remaining six.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteHowever, GAAP earnings for the quarter came in at 16 cents versus 39 cents in the prior-year period, significantly hurt by items affecting comparability.Net sales fell 1.6% to $744.6 million in the second quarter and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 766 million by 2.8%. In fact, its top line has lagged the consensus mark in 10 of the last 14 quarters.The decline is attributed to the 2.6% negative impact from the sale of its low-margin businesses comprising Aunt Jemima (AJ) retail and foodservice frozen breakfast products. In addition, the company’s top line included a 0.9% impact from the closing of Boulder UK operations as well as SKU rationalization program initiated in the second half of 2016. However, these negatives were offset by robust underlying sales growth of 1.9%.Adjusted gross profit decreased 6.8% to $203.8 million with the gross margin contraction of 150 basis points (bps) to 27.4%. This was attributable to adverse margin that was over 200 bps from the certain discrete items.Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) slipped 0.5% to $114.2 million in the quarter.Segment DetailsFrozen: Segment sales rose 2.5% to $295.9 million in the quarter on the back of higher volume/mix of 9.2%, partially offset by reduced net price realization of 2.4% and currency headwinds of 0.3%.However, adjusted EBIT for the segment dropped 14.4% to $38.1 million as unfavorable impact from discrete items was higher than increased productivity as well as positive timing of marketing spending.Grocery: Segment sales fell 1.8% to $276.1 million due to the unfavorable net price realization of 2.1%, somewhat compensated with favorable volume/mix of 0.3%.Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 15% to $61.9 million backed by productivity savings, synergies from the Boulder Brands acquisition as well as favorable impact from items affecting comparability. These items were offset by input cost inflation.Boulder: Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15, 2016. Consequently, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company.In second-quarter 2017, Boulder segment contributed $94.7 million to net sales, which is in line with the prior-year period. This represents higher volume/mix of 4.9%, along with favorable net price realization of 2.8%, which were mitigated by the winding down of the Boulder UK operations and SKU rationalization program.Adjusted EBIT for the Boulder Brands segment totaled $15.8 million, up 30.3% from the prior-year quarter.Specialty Foods: Segment sales declined 15.1% to $78 million due to reduced volume/mix of 6.8% and 8.9% decrease from the AJ exit, partly favorable net price realization of 0.6%. Meanwhile, the private label business continued to be under pressure in the quarter as was anticipated by the company, due to lower sales of USDA stew as well as the exit of the gardein private label business. Also, the segment’s adjusted EBIT plunged 39.5% to $4.4 million in the reported quarter.Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has been witnessing sluggish net sales for the Specialty segment for quite some time now. Due to a heightened competitive bidding environment for the already low-margin USDA stew business, the company continues to expect Specialty to remain challenged through 2017, reflecting lower sales of private label canned meat.Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $130.9 million, long-term debt of $2,940.8 million, and total equity of $1,944.9 million.In the quarter, the company generated cash flow from operations of $57 million and incurred capital expenditure of $20 million. Additionally, its total free cash flow for the quarter totaled $37 million.2017 GuidancePinnacle Foods reaffirmed its adjusted earnings guidance in the band of $2.55–$2.60 per share for 2017 but expects the same to be at the lower end. This reflects a year-over-year increase of nearly 19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.59 for the full year.Net sales and adjusted earnings for 2017 are anticipated to gain roughly 1% and 3 cents, respectively, from the 53rd week. Further, this is likely to benefit the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, the company continues to expect input cost inflation in the range of 2.5−3% for the year. Productivity is estimated to be at the top or marginally above its cost of products sold range of 3.5–4%. Notably, this does not include the synergies of not less than $15 million from Boulder Brands acquisition, which are likely to benefit the gross margin as well as SG&A overhead.Additionally, capital expenditures for the full year are expected to be in the range of $115–$125 million.Our TakeOverall, the company boasts of a strong brand portfolio and intends to continue investing in innovation products to further differentiate its brands in the marketplace. It has also been pursuing various acquisitions over the years to enhance its distribution network, customer base and long-term growth.Moreover, Pinnacle Foods has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fact, these productivity savings, along with higher pricing have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same industry include Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report).Nomad Foods has delivered positive earnings surprise of 3.9% in the last reported quarter and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1611,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 3% from 70 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.  Including one-time items, earnings came in at 59 cents a share compared with 67 cents reported in the year-ago period.Despite earnings beat, Colgate’s shares are down 2.3% during pre-market trading hours, as investors remained skeptical about the company’s top-line performance that fell short of expectations for the fifth straight quarter. In fact in the last three months, the stock has declined 2.1% compared with the broader industry’s growth of 2.9%.Deeper InsightTotal sales of $3,826 million dipped 0.5% from the year-ago period and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,885 million. The benefits of 1% increase in prices were offset by a 1% drop in global unit volumes and a negative impact of 0.5% from currency fluctuations.On an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales were flat with last year. The flat results were due to the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. This was considerably mitigated by strong organic sales growth in Latin America and the return to positive organic sales growth in Hill’s Pet Nutrition.Adjusted gross profit margin was 60.7%, up 50 basis points (bps), driven by benefits of cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program, along with better pricing. These were partly neutralized by increased raw and packaging material expenses, including currency exchange transactions costs.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $995 million dipped 1%, with the adjusted operating margin contracting 10 bps to 26% on 40 bps increase in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, offset by improved gross margin.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.8%. Further, the company continued to lead with market share in the global toothpaste with a gain of 43.6% year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (20% of total sales) fell 3.5%, reflecting a 2% drop in unit volume and 1.5% decline in pricing. However, currency fluctuations were flat with the prior-year quarter. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.5% on account of market share losses in the dish liquid business and increased slowdown in category growth, both in the U.S.Latin America net sales (26% of total sales) jumped 7% year over year gaining from 4.5% increase in pricing and 2.5% volume gains, while currency fluctuations were flat with the prior-year quarter. Volume growth can mainly be attributed to increase in Brazil, the Andean region and Argentina. On an organic basis, sales increased 7%.Europe net sales (15% of total sales) slipped 3.5% year over year, due to 1% decline in unit volumes and negative impact of 3% from currency fluctuations, partially offset by 0.5% increase in pricing. Unit volumes were hurt by declines in Germany and Norway, offsetting gains in the Netherlands, U.K. and Poland. Europe organic sales dipped 0.5%.Asia Pacific net sales (18% of total sales) declined 5%, attributable to 2% decline in unit volume and 1.5% fall in pricing and 1.5% negative impact from currency fluctuations. Unit volumes declines in India, Thailand and Australia were partly offset by gains in the Philippines, Vietnam and New Zealand. On an organic basis, sales for Asia Pacific decreased 3.5% due to the inventory reductions by wholesalers in India in anticipation of the new Goods and Services Tax that went into effect on Jul 1, 2017. Additionally, increased competition related activities in Australia and lower consumptions in Thailand acted as headwinds.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) inched up 1% year over year, fueled by 4.5% jump in pricing and positive currency effects of 4%, partly offset by 7.5% drop in unit volumes. Volume declines in the Sub Saharan Africa region, Turkey and South Africa were partly offset by gains in Russia. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 3%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were flat with the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, positive impact from 2% increase in pricing was neutralized by 1.5% decline in volumes and 0.5% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume declines in the U.S., Japan and Canada were slightly countered by gains in Russia, Latin America and South Africa. On an organic basis, sales rose 0.5%.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteOther Financial DetailsColgate ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,241 million and total debt of $6,519 million. Net cash provided by operating activities came in at $1,305 million for the six months ended Jun 30, 2017.OutlookLooking forward, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. Consequently, the company reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low-single digits growth. However, on account of the soft first half 2017, management now envisions organic sales growth for 2017 to be in the low-single digit range, compared with the previous forecast of moderately below 4–7% range.Nevertheless, the company remains encouraged by the progress on its 2012 Restructuring Program and continues to pursue additional savings opportunities under the program. In this regard, the company stated that the additional opportunities identified in the second-quarter provide visibility for reaching the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range.Consequently, on a GAAP basis, management forecasts gross margin expansion for the year. Further, it expects GAAP earnings per share, on a dollar basis, to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, compared with the previously stated flat guidance.Excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and the other 2016 one-time items, Colgate continues to project low-single-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis for 2017. Further, the company anticipates robust operating cash flows, gross margin expansion and rise in advertising investment for the year.Zacks Rank & Key PicksColgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This officially unlocked a procedure using which the tax code can be changed using a simple majority of only Republican votes, instead of the 60 votes norm usually followed. Trump and his fellow Republicans had campaigned on bringing about much needed tax reforms and such an event gets the members of GOP even closer to delivering on their promise.In a 216 to 212 vote, the House cleared the budget blueprint, with as many as 20 Republicans voting against it.

1615,CL,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a British consumer products company, for $4.2 billion. The transaction, subjected to regulatory approvals, will be funded through a combination of debt and equity and is expected to be completed either in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Per Bloomberg, Reckitt has been looking to divest its food business since April, which invited many potential buyers including Post Holdings Inc. and Conagra Brands Inc. Other bidders included JM Smucker Co., Campbell Soup Co., Pinnacle Foods Inc. and Ajinomoto Co., as per sources. Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) was also reportedly battling with meat producer Hormel Foods Corporation to buy the foods division of Reckitt Benckiser.Why is the Buyout a Strategic Fit for McCormick?McCormick, which is well known for manufacturing and distributing spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors to the entire food industry across the globe, has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. The acquisitions (Gourmet Garden in Apr 2016 and Enrico Giotti SpA in Dec 2016) contributed toward increasing sales by 3% during the second quarter of 2017, reported last month.The acquisition of Reckitt’s food division is a strategic one as it will significantly boost the company’s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce, French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce. Notably, both Frank's RedHot and French's Mustard hold top most positions in their respective categories in the U.S. and Canada. As a result, these brands will position the company in the leading U.S. condiments category and will strengthen and expand McCormick's business presence internationally too. The deal is also expected to result in combined pro forma 2017 annual net sales of approximately $5 billion.SynergiesWith the addition of foods business, McCormick expects cost synergies of approximately $50 million which will be achieved by 2020. The company expects to achieve significant margin and earnings accretion in 2017 and will achieve additional favorable impacts following the realization of targeted synergies.Share Price Performance A promising portfolio combined with robust initiatives has been favoring the company which is well reflected in the share price performance of the company. The company has also delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 quarters. Shares of McCormick have moved up 5.1% in the last six months against the Zacks categorized Food–Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 5.6%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a VGM Score of “B” which further makes it attractive.However, negative impact of material costs and currency has been impacting the company’s performance of late. Currency headwinds of approximately 2% impacted the second-quarter results of the company. Such impacts are likely to persist throughout fiscal 2017.Bottom LineNevertheless, McCormick is expected to overcome these challenges on the back of sustained cost savings efforts and the growth arising out of strategic acquisitions.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Last quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 1.5%.Colgate has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, the company has posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three. Thus, the company’s average positive earnings surprise is pegged at 0.7% for the trailing four quarters.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise  Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Colgate will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 72 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.6%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.89 billion, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed both the Zacks categorized Soap & Cleaning Preparations industry and the S&P 500 Index in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 2.6%, while the Zacks categorized industry and the S&P 500 have witnessed gains of 1.2% and 5.2%, respectively.Factors at PlayColgate, which enjoys a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories, continues to focus on product innovations, globally recognized brands and broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets. Further, it is focused on these plans to take advantage of growth opportunities, consequently enhancing profitability.Moreover, the company continues to progress well with savings programs, as both, Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program, and Funding the Growth undertakings are delivering impressive results. These initiatives contributed significantly to margin expansion in first-quarter 2017.However, the company’s sales trend remains soft largely due to unfavorable currency movements. The company lagged sales estimates in 15 out of the past 16 quarters. Moreover, adverse currency and a tough global environment are likely to impact 2017 results. Nonetheless, organic sales are anticipated to improve sequentially throughout the year.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Colgate is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Colgate has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 72 cents. While the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

1619,CL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.1%.Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable at 58 cents in the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects a year-over-year growth of about 9% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $751 million, down more than 1% from the prior-year period.Markedly, Pinnacle Foods is part of the Consumer Staples sector. As of Oct 20 Earnings Preview, the Consumer Staples sector’s earnings as well as revenues are expected to grow 1.8% each.Factors Likely to Influence the QuarterPinnacle Foods has been gaining from its solid brand portfolio and robust strategic initiatives. The company has been also innovating products to offer variety and maintain market share. Additionally, the company’s expansion via acquisitions drives growth and remains impressive. The notable acquisitions include Boulder Brands and Duncan Hines.Meanwhile, Pinnacle Foods’ operational excellence program designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain, remains encouraging. Productivity for 2017 is estimated to be at the top or marginally above its cost of products sold range of 3.5–4%. These productivity savings, along with higher pricing have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins.Additionally, in order to enhance gross margin, Pinnacle Foods is pursuing other initiatives including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending, and realizing synergies from acquisitions.These initiatives are reflected in the company’s share price, which increased 4.8% year to date, as against the industry’s decline of 10.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of the Frozen, Grocery and Specialty Foods segments are currently pegged at $315 million, $259 million and $84 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year increase of about 2%, 3.8% and 5.8% for each segment, correspondingly.Also, volume for the Frozen and Grocery segments is likely to increase 0.04% and 0.01%, respectively, in the quarter. However, volumes are expected to decline 0.04% for the Specialty Foods segment. We note that Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing sluggish net sales and adjusted EBIT for its Specialty segment since four consecutive quarters now, despite solid growth in the Snacks business. Evidently, sales at the segment declined 15.1% in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, the company has witnessed sluggishness in its Pickle business due to continued competitive environment in the form of pricing and innovation. This, in turn has put pressure on the performance of Vlasic pickles. Though innovation and in-store support for the brand is expected to strengthen trends for the business in the second half of 2017, the turnaround might take some time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuotePinnacle Foods has an Earnings ESP of +2.03%. Also, it carries a Zacks Rank #2, which makes us confident of an earnings beat.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

1620,CL,"We expect the designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products, V. F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.In fact, the company has recorded an average positive surprise of 0.7% in the last four quarters, missing estimates only in one quarter.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether V.F. Corp. will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.12 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $3.41 billion, down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteHowever, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 13.7%, while the industry grew 2.1%.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp's second-quarter 2017 results marked a comeback as earnings topped estimates after delivering two straight quarters of in-line results. Also, sales broke its four-quarter long negative surprise trend, backed by strength in international and direct-to-customer platforms, the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and the company’s workwear business, which forms a part of the Imagewear coalition.Notably, the company’s Outdoor & Action Sports coalition has delivered positive revenue surprise in the last two quarters. Further, its Imagewear coalition has delivered better-than-expected profits in five of the last six quarters.Management expects to sustain its solid momentum in 2017, which encouraged it to raise outlook.The momentum in V.F. Corp.’s shares can largely be attributable to its focus on 2021 strategy that provides visibility into its efforts to grow business and boost shareholder value. The company recently raised 2021 revenue and earnings per share targets to include the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, which is expected to contribute more than $1 billion to revenue and in excess of 25 cents per share to earnings through 2021.The company now anticipates five-year compounded annual revenue growth rate (CAGR) of 5-7% to more than $15 billion, through 2021. This compares with the previous forecast of 4-6% at a five-year CAGR. Further, it now estimates earnings per share growth of 11-13% at a five-year CAGR, to more than $5 per share. The company had previously predicted earnings per share growth of 10-12% at a five-year CAGR. Moreover, the company had previously anticipated generating cumulative operating cash flows in excess of $9 billion in the five-year period between 2017 and 2021 along with returning about $8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.However, adverse currency translations continue to be a hurdle and are expected to hurt margins and sales in 2017. Nonetheless, we expect V.F. Corp.’s growth strategies to help it sail through these headwinds this earnings season.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that V. F. Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Earnings ESP of +0.07% and the company’s Zacks Rank #2 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1621,CL,"The struggles of the Sports Goods industry, be it Sports Gear Retailers or Producers of Sportswear brands, are far from over. Among the various factors plaguing the Sporting Goods Retailers, the prominent ones are  changing consumer habits, Sportswear brands turning to direct selling channels and increased competition. Additionally, the general retailing backdrop has turned highly promotional, creating pressure on margins and the bottom line.Notably, the general trend suggests customers are becoming more dependent on digital devices and mobile phones for their buying habits. Responding to this trend, sportswear brands are building up their online presence by teaming up with e-retailers as well as improving their website for a chic e-commerce experience. Though sportswear brands still value and recognize sporting goods retailers as an important sales channel, these companies have reduced their inventory with retailers to combat the soft traffic at stores.Citing an example from the sportswear brands, NIKE Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) recently took to selling directly to consumers on social media and e-commerce platforms, as evident from its recent deal with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). NIKE is executing a pilot program with Amazon in the United States, where it will sell limited product assortments on the latter’s website. Earlier, the company sold on Amazon through unlicensed third-party resellers. Under this partnership, NIKE will look to improve the NIKE brand experience on Amazon by improvising the presentation and increasing the quality of storytelling. It also announced plans to sell products directly to consumers through Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Instagram.Why Sportswear Brands Are Suffering?The concerns for the sportswear brands mainly stems from to foreign currency headwinds, intense competition, higher costs to develop omni-channel capabilities and inventory management, challenging retail environment and aggressive promotions. Notably, the revenues for these brands remain strong due to growth in the sports participation rate owing to increased health and fitness consciousness. However, the margins and bottom line have been hurt by the aforementioned factors.How Are These Industries Placed?While retailers selling sports gear are a part of the Zacks Retail-Miscellaneous space, sellers of sports footwear retailers belong to the Zacks Retail-Apparel and Shoes industry - both forming a part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Notably, the Retail-Miscellaneous industry is placed at the bottom 9% (232 of 256) of the Zacks classified industries, while the Retail-Apparel and Shoes space is at the top 36% with a Zacks Industry Rank of #91. Further, the respective industries have slumped 16.1% and 23.3% year to date, compared with the S&P 500 market’s 13.8% growth.Moreover, the sportswear brands come under the Zacks Shoes and Related Apparel industry, which is a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry is placed at the top 30% (77 of 256) of Zacks industries and has gained 3.7% year to date. However, it has underperformed the S&P 500 market’s growth.That said, we bring to you some stocks that are trending well despite the industry challenges and can be banked upon. Further, we present to you few stocks that have fallen prey to the turmoil and should be avoided currently.Stocks Trending UpWe have hand-picked some industry outperformers with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), VGM Score of A or B, robust earnings surprise trend and strong fundamentals.First on the list is Caleres, Inc. (CL  -  Free Report), a footwear retailer and wholesaler offering licensed, branded, and private-label casual, dress, and athletic footwear products to women, men, and children. The company currently has a VGM Score of A and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has delivered positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for Caleres is 11%. Moreover, the stock has gained 13.8% in the last three months, against the industry’s 8.7% decline.Another lucrative option is Goleta, CA-based Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report). The company is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports, and other lifestyle-related activities. It has a VGM Score of A and carries a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 76.7% in the preceding four quarters. Further, the company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.8%. The stock grew 28.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 3.7% upside.Last but not the least, investors may consider Steven Madden, Ltd. (SHOO  -  Free Report) that designs, sources, markets, and sells fashionable brands and private label footwear for women, men, and children globally. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises with an average beat of 7.1% in the trailing four quarters. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for Steven Madden is 12.3%. The stock has gained 19.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 3.7% growth.Stocks to AvoidWhile some stocks have made their way out of the woods, there are ones that have succumbed to the hardships in the sports goods space. So, it is advisable to avoid these stocks with Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell), dismal stock performance and an unfavorable outlook.We suggest keeping away from Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report), which operates sporting goods stores in small to mid-sized markets in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and lower Midwest regions of the United States. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 and a VGM Score of C. Moreover, the stock has declined a substantial 61.2% year to date, wider than the industry’s 16.1% dip. The decrease can be attributed to the company’s dismal sales surprise history, reflecting a top line miss in nine of the last 10 quarters. Further, Hibbett trimmed guidance for fiscal 2018 due to soft second-quarter fiscal 2018 results and expectations of the persistence of a tough retail environment.Also avoid, New York-based Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report). This retailer of athletic shoes and apparel operates through the Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers segments. This Zacks Rank #5 company has delivered negative earnings in the preceding two quarters, with an average miss of 6.6% for the trailing four quarters. The company’s results in the last reported quarter were impacted by soft performance of “some recent top styles” and lack of innovative fresh products in the market. Moreover, the company provided a bleak outlook as it expects the challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern to make the operating environment tough. Consequently, the stock has declined a substantial 51.4% year to date, wider than the industry’s slump of 23.2%.Finally, we suggest getting rid of Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names. This Zacks Rank #4 company has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 19.2% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, investors remain apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom line performance that has been declining for the past five straight quarters due to rise in selling and general & administrative expenses. The stock has dropped 11.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 8.7%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1622,CL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) maintains its commitment to enhance shareholders’ value through dividend payouts. Recently, management has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 14% to 32.50 cents per share from the previous payout of 28.50 cents.Effective third-quarter 2017, the new dividend will be paid on Oct 9, to shareholders of record as on Aug 29, 2017. This brings the company’s annualized dividend to $1.30 per share, representing an increase from the previous annualized rate of $1.14 per share.Notably, this was the fifth dividend hike by Pinnacle Foods since the initiation of its quarterly dividend program shortly after its IPO in March 2013. The last dividend hike of 12% to 28.50 cents per share was announced in August 2016.Dividend hike is frequent among companies with a stable cash position and healthy cash flows. We believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Basically, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it.Apart from Pinnacle Foods, companies like The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) and Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividends by 4% to 78 cents and 12.5% to 22.50 cents per share, respectively.Another company that remains keen on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments is Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) since 1895. Keeping up with this trend, the company hiked quarterly dividend by 3% to 40 cents in March, compared with the previous payout of 39 cents per share.However, following the dividend hike announcement, very less movement was noticed in the Pinnacle Foods' shares yesterday. Shares of this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products have inched up a meager 1% yesterday. Nonetheless, the stock has rallied 10.4% in the last six months against the industry’s decline of 4.3%. Currently, the industry is placed at the bottom 21% of the Zacks classified industries (203 out of 256).Pinnacle Foods boasts a strong brands portfolio, and also make acquisitions to grow its distribution network as well as customer base. Further, it has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain, which remains encouraging.In July, Pinnacle Foods posted mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, top line missed the same. With this, the company’s earnings have outperformed the consensus mark in seven of the trailing nine quarters. Currently, Pinnacle Foods carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"
1648,CL,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with almost 40% of the reports in. While in this report we have not tracked revenues, there seems to be a general pattern where the source of the positive surprises is coming from much better-than-expected margins (both operating and net) rather than from better-than-expected revenue growth. In other words companies are succeeding in cost cutting their way, if not to prosperity, then at least much better than feared results.
"
1649,CL,"While, at the individual company level, this is almost always a positive, it is not necessarily so at the macro level. Cutting costs by reducing head count means that there are fewer jobs and less overall demand in the economy. Still, given the weak state of the economy, I suspect most investors will not be too picky about the source of the earnings improvements.
"
1650,CL,"The one exception to this might be in the financials, where the earnings quality is weak due to FASB caving to political pressure and doing away with mark to market accounting. On the other hand, I have not seen any situations of massive mark-to-market of the liabilities but not the assets like we saw in the first quarter.
"
1651,CL,"The total earnings reported so far is $78.9 billion, a decline of 16.1% from the $94.0 billion the same 198 firms reported a year ago. However, on a sequential basis earnings are up 7.1% from the first quarter pace. Actual earnings growth has been a pretty rare commodity with only 63 firms actually posting higher net income than a year ago.
"
1652,CL,"The median EPS growth rate is a negative 17.3%. (Those still left to report have a median expected EPS growth rate of -13.7%.) While the median EPS growth reported is largely in line with the total net income decline, there is a big difference when it comes to those yet to report.
"
1653,CL,"The total net income of the remaining firms is expected to plunge 40.3%, which is far worse than what we have seen so far, as well as very different from the median. The big decline in total net income for the remaining firms may be in part due to the mix of firms that have reported, with a very small percentage of the total energy earnings in yet (20% of Energy firms have reported, but none of the big guys that represent the bulk of the earnings in the sector). On the other hand it means that the bar is set very low for the remaining firms and we may well see more positive earnings surprises.
"
1654,CL,"Keep in mind that medians are inherently equally weighted with the growth rate of a relatively small firm counting as much as that of an Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) or a Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report).

"
1668,CL,"Total Revisions activity rising rapidly
"
1669,CL,"So far, this is looking like the story of the dog that didn't bark. Yes, the revisions ratio has edged up, but given the magnitude and number of positive surprises in second quarter earnings, one would expect a flood of positive estimate revisions.
"
1670,CL,"After all the second quarter is part of the full year 2009, so if a company beats the estimates for the quarter, and the analysts do not raise their estimates for the full year by the amount of the beat, then they are implicitly cutting their forecasts for the third and fourth quarters. There is a very good possibility that this is simply a lag effect in the data, as the pace of reports has really picked up in the last few days. If so we should see the revisions ratios rise dramatically over the next few weeks. If not, it will be a subtle, but very disturbing sign.
"
1671,CL,"The defensive Staples and Health Care sectors are doing the best on the revision front. However, Materials is about as cyclical a sector as you can think of and it has shown a great improvement in its revisions ratio, apparently in response to the much better-than-expected earnings in the sector. Utilities are the weakest sector, followed by the very small Telecom sector. No Utilities have reported yet and only one Telecom company (AT&T (T  -  Free Report)) has reported.
"
1672,CL,"In the Staples and Health Care sectors, analysts generally tend to be in tight agreement about the expected earnings (small standard deviation around the mean estimate). They, therefore, will not show up on screens of the biggest estimate revisions. On the other hand it means that even small changes in the mean estimate can be significant, and it is best to look for large numbers of analysts changing their estimates in one direction, rather than for big changes in the mean estimate.
"
1673,CL,"In Health Care, the big drug companies stand out in this regard. Among the notables are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Schering-Plough (SGP). The same is true for the staples, where some of the stocks with large numbers of estimate increases include Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Colgate Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report).
"
1674,CL,"The Materials sector is much more prone to big changes in earnings estimates. There, Freeport-Mcmoran (FCX  -  Free Report) was a real stand out with its mean estimate for 2009 leaping by over 80% in the last four weeks.

"
1720,CL,"The revisions ratio reversed course, falling after a long string of steady increases. The reversal brought it from the abysmal lows of 0.20 last winter (i.e. 5 cuts for every increase) to a high of 1.29 two weeks ago. Last winter, in individual sectors, the cuts were often in excess of 10:1.
"
1721,CL,"The current reading is on a very low number of total revisions, which is quite normal for this time of the quarter. However, it is sort of like a stock that moves on low volume. Its good if the stock moves up, but you have less conviction about its significance than if it is on high volume.
"
1722,CL,"Tech has moved up substantially in the revisions ratio rankings in large part due to the strength in the Chip industry. Some of the real standouts in terms of large numbers of estimate increases leading to very large increases in mean estimates are National Semiconductor (NSM) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).
"
1723,CL,"The strength in Staples was lead by General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report). However it is a sector where the estimate changes do not tend to be dramatic. Two other notables that had many more increases than cuts, but small changes in the mean estimate, were Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report). The one firm in the sector that was noteworthy in heading south was Walgreens (WAG).
"
1724,CL,"The weakness in the Industrial sector was most apparent in some of the transportation related companies, like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airline (LUV  -  Free Report). Paccar (PCAR  -  Free Report) was also very weak.

1743,CL,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 18, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading grocery dealer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 6.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model conclusively shows earnings beat for SUPERVALU this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSUPERVALU has an Earnings ESP of +24.64% with a Zacks Rank #3. This increases the predictive power of ESP, thus making us confident of an earnings beat.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents for the fiscal second quarter has been stable in the last 30 days while it reflects a year-over-year decline of about 50% from the year-ago quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.30 for fiscal 2018 shows 13.2% growth from fiscal 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,758 million for the impending quarter, down 2.8% from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, revenues of $15.50 billion are forecasted for fiscal 2018, thus showing an increase of 3.5% from fiscal 2017.Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterSUPERVALU is battling with its sluggish retail business for quite some time, owing to tough competitive pressure and lower store traffic. Evidently, the company has witnessed negative sales from identical retail stores for the last nine quarters. Additionally, the company is facing competition from traditional grocery rivals that are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples.Further, revenues generated from existing transition services agreements with Albertson’s LLC and NAI, which are expected to wind-down over the next two years are anticipated to contribute to lower corporate sales and operating earnings in fiscal 2018. Consequently, SUPERVALU’s share price declined 26.9% in the last six months, wider than the industry’s loss of 7.4%.Nevertheless, the company’s focus on accelerating business by making acquisitions and supply agreements in its wholesale segment remains noteworthy. These agreements are expected to boost its top line in fiscal 2018.SUPERVALU is also trying to develop wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to boost the company’s wholesale business and complement its customer base.Furthermore, the company has been shutting down its underperforming locations. This, in turn, will allow it to utilize its resources and investments on a few strong performing locations. Additionally, SUPERVALU has been striving to reduce cost and resorted to ‘single sourcing’ in its independent businesses in order to induce greater operating efficiency.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.70% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.55% and a Zacks Rank #2.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.77% and a Zacks Rank #2.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1761,CL,"In another busy day in Washington, Bernanke again warned of the doom and gloom upon the U.S., should the bill fail to pass. The Fed Chairman said ""Credit will be restricted further for homeownership, for small business, for individual consumers and so on, but that is not just an inconvenience. What that is going to do is affect spending and economic activity and it will cause the economy as a whole to decline and be much weaker than it otherwise would be."" This was the most pessimistic statement yet from Bernanke.

1783,CL,"3. SCREEN OF THE WEEKBack to topZacks created the first and best screening system on the web and that`s what earned us the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.  Discover 2 excellent screening tools perfectly suited for individual investors.* Free Stock Screener on Zacks.com: http://screening.zacks.com.* Research Wizard with backtesting: http://researchwiz.zacks.com.Each week Kevin Matras, of Zacks Investment Research, will share with you another screen he has discovered that has created winning results. Here are his latest findings:Price & Volume: Pulling Profits and Spotting Potential Trend ChangesWith stock, after stock, after stock, screaming higher over the last 
"
1784,CL,"couple of months, it's now more important than ever to pay attention 
"
1785,CL,"to your stock's volume. And while some stocks rightfully deserved to 
"
1786,CL,"move higher, others simply benefited from the ""rising tide raises all
"
1787,CL,"ships"" phenomenon.So look at your stocks. Did they move higher convincingly on growing 
"
1788,CL,"volume or did they mark higher prices on diminishing volume? This is 
"
1789,CL,"important since volume is supposed to follow price. If the stocks on 
"
1790,CL,"your radar are moving higher, but without greater investor interest, 
"
1791,CL,"it can often mean a pullback is in the near offing.An analogy that someone told me illustrates this clearly. Imagine you
"
1792,CL,"have a water hose and a ball. If you placed the ball on top of the 
"
1793,CL,"water hose and sprayed it upwards, the stream of water being sprayed 
"
1794,CL,"lifts the ball. The more water pressure you give it, the higher the 
"
1795,CL,"ball will go. But once you start easing up on the water pressure, the
"
1796,CL,"ball will stop moving higher and eventually start falling as the water
"
1797,CL,"pressure diminishes.And that's basically what happens with stocks too. The more buying 
"
1798,CL,"pressure there is, the higher it'll go. But once the buying pressure 
"
1799,CL,"eases up, it often means a pullback is in store. The pullback can be 
"
1800,CL,"an ordinary retracement as new buyers catch their breath or it could 
"
1801,CL,"be a trend-changing event. So pay attention to what the volume is 
"
1802,CL,"telling you and be alert.A screen for helping you weed out the weak from the strong can be as 
"
1803,CL,"simple as looking for 3 days (or more) of higher prices while each day
"
1804,CL,"it's registering less buying pressure (lower volume). Including: (as 
"

"
1806,CL,"FHR    Fairmont Hotels & Resorts
"
1807,CL,"UTX    United Technologies Corp.There are many more stocks that appear on that list. If your stocks 
"
1808,CL,"show up on it, pay close attention. They could be in store for a 
"
1809,CL,"direction change.You can also look for three days down (or unchanged) with increasing 
"
1810,CL,"volume. Lots of action with no upside progress can often be a sign of
"
1811,CL,"distribution (people selling off their stock), or people getting 
"
1812,CL,"short. Such as: (as of the end of business on Fri. 6/6/03)CL     Colgate-Palmolive Co.
"
1813,CL,"LEE    Lee Enterprises, Inc.
"
1814,CL,"PRU    Prudential Financial, Inc.You may even want to check for stocks with big price drops on much 
"
1815,CL,"larger than average volume. If the price falls by let's say a $1 for 
"
1816,CL,"instance on 20% more volume than average, that can also be your queue
"
1817,CL,"that things may be changing. Again, since volume in general should 
"
1818,CL,"follow the price, a big volume drop could be foreshadowing even lower
"
1819,CL,"prices to come.Such as: (as of the end of business on Fri. 6/6/03)MXIM   Maxim Integrated Products

1830,CL,"Shares of Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) declined 5.2% over the last three months, as against the industry’s gain of 5.3%. Moreover, the stock has underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector that gained 1.4%. However, management remains on track to deliver growth on the back of its savings programs and other initiatives.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock exhibits a VGM Score of “D”. Let’s delve deep to explore more about the stock.Soft Sales Trend & Bleak OutlookColgate’s dismal sales trend reveals that its top line has lagged estimates for the last 17 quarters. Moreover, the company’s revenues fell short of expectations for the fifth straight quarter in second-quarter 2017 due to continued softness in North America and challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.Going forward, the company anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. While it reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low-single digits growth, the company lowered its organic sales growth guidance on account of a soft first-half 2017.Furthermore, Colgate anticipates GAAP earnings per share, on a dollar basis, to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared with the previously stated flat guidance.Consequently, the estimates witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89 for 2017 and $3.11 for 2018 has declined 1% and 1.6%, respectively.Other HeadwindsForeign exchange continues to be a headwind for Colgate in some markets as it derives around 75% of revenues from outside the U.S. In fact, the Asia-Pacific region and the Hill’s Pet Nutrition business were impacted by negative currency translations in the second quarter. Also, management expects it to hurt results throughout 2017.In addition, the company faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) and The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Strategic InitiativesOn the positive side, Colgate has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. The company posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters, while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.Further, Colgate is progressing well with its savings programs, as both, its Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program and Funding the Growth undertakings are delivering impressive results. Evidently, these initiatives contributed in gross margin expansion in the quarter, and expect GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.With these initiatives, Colgate focuses on reducing structural costs, standardizing processes and enhancing its market share position worldwide. Also, the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, while also reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Moreover, it commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories and maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Going forward, the company expects to further grow its market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Bottom LineWe believe Colgate’s growth drivers to outweigh the obstacles in the near term, and help regain its momentum.Meanwhile, you can count upon a better-ranked stock from the same industry, which is Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report), with long-term earnings growth rate of 9.4%. Also, it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1831,CL,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) looks good on the back of its long-term initiatives, solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, strong brand portfolio and a disciplined capital strategy.Let’s find out more about the stock, which also boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.2020 StrategyClorox remains keen on the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In fact, the whole strategy is aimed at achieving certain long-term aspirations, including growing net sales by 3−5%, improvement of EBIT margin by 25−50 basis points, and generating free cash flow of 10−12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.We note that the company is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of eCommerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds – desire, decision and delight.Sturdy Q4 Results & Favorable OutlookClorox posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. Notably, earnings marked the third straight quarter of a beat, while sales reverted to its positive surprise track after a miss in the last quarter.While the bottom line gained from strong sales and cost-savings, the top line was fueled by higher volumes, better International pricing and benefits from RenewLife (acquired in May 2016). Further, sales grew year over year in each segment in the quarter. The company’s fiscal 2017 performance also remained robust with solid top- and bottom-line growth year over year. (Read More: Clorox Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat the Zacks Consensus)Further, management is encouraged by its International operations, and expects pricing and cost savings to continue driving results. It expects fiscal 2018 to represent another year of strong earnings and sales growth. For fiscal 2018, Clorox expects sales to grow in a range of 2–4%, and earnings from continuing operations to rise 3–7% year over year.Other StrengthsWe believe Clorox's diversified brand portfolio places the company well above its peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain itself in the currently challenging environment.In fact, its focus on boosting sales through brands is well-evident from its constant innovations and marketing strategies to drive top-line growth. Alongside, it maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy, making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to lower debts and enhance shareholder returns.Concerns/WeaknessHowever, the stock is not devoid of concerns/headwinds, which might dampen its performance in the near term. Clorox’s significant international presence exposes it to major foreign currency risks (especially in Argentina), which have hurt results for a while in the past. Also, currency headwinds are expected to have one point adverse impact on sales growth in fiscal 2018.Additionally, Clorox faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Bottom LineWhile these headwinds, along with a retail landscape that is expected to be more competitive in fiscal 2018, the company’s focus on its 2020 strategy and continued investments in innovating products and brands, will help drive results.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1832,CL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) continues to progress well with its savings programs along with a disciplined capital strategy and other initiatives. However, the company has a dismal sales trend.Savings Programs Bode WellColgate remains committed to its savings programs as both Global Growth and Efficiency Program (or 2012 Restructuring Program) as well as Funding the Growth initiatives are delivering impressive results.Furthermore, the company stated that the additional savings opportunities identified under the program in the second quarter of 2017 provide visibility to reach the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range. Consequently, the company expects both GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.Markedly, this four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share position worldwide.Meanwhile, through funding growth initiative the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers while reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are anticipated to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Other CatalystsColgate commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. In fact, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles of the company’s growth strategy over the years, thus enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. Management further expects to grow market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Going forward, the company remains focused on four fundamentals to boost profits including, increased spending on more impactful advertisements, innovation across portfolio of businesses, higher spends on high growth e-commerce business and aggressively maximizing productivity.Additionally, Colgate has always followed a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This strategy focuses on making investments to develop business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks owing to its strong cash generation ability.Stellar Earnings TrendColgate, which shares space with Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report), The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, the company has posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.ConcernsColgate has a dismal sales trend as its top line has lagged estimates in 16 of the trailing 17 quarters. In fact, the company’s second-quarter results marked its fifth straight sales miss. Sales in the quarter were hurt by the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, low global unit volumes and negative currency fluctuations were deterrents.Management anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide in the near term.Bottom LineWhile the soft sales trends indicate weakness, we remain confident of the company’s growth prospects, given its innovation track record and ongoing initiatives. We believe the company’s actions will help counter the dismal sales trends. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1833,CL,"It is so much more fun to write this after 3 consecutive days of gains.
"
1834,CL,"Three weeks ago, I stated that the markets were oversold and due for a bounce. Obviously, my call was too early, but it does show this week's rebound was expected.
"
1835,CL,"After all, stocks never move in a straight direction, regardless if it's a bear market or a bull market.
"
1836,CL,"At the same time, Treasuries are having a good week. An auction of 30-year bonds went extremely well yesterday. Auctions of short-term notes earlier this week were also successful.
"
1837,CL,"Even gold has started to come back over the past few days.
"
1838,CL,"So all is right with the world, right?
"
1839,CL,"Unfortunately not.
"
1840,CL,"Believe me, I really want to proclaim that a bottom has been set, but it hasn't. This week's upward move by stocks is nothing more than a bear market rally. Bear market rallies can be spectacular, but like a snow-covered mountain, they are also very dangerous.
"
1841,CL,"Just look at the economic backdrop. EU officials are scoffing at more stimulus. (Given their Don Quixote fight against inflation, is anybody really surprised?) Foreclosures rose last month. More Americans continue to lose their jobs. The stimulus package has yet to flow to our wallets.
"
1842,CL,"Then there is the banking and automotive crisis. Does anybody really believe the banks are operating at a profit? This only makes sense if you exclude toxic debt and consider the banks are lending money that was practically given to them for free. U.S. automakers remain on the brink of destruction and a $40,000 Volt probably isn't the car cash-strapped consumers are looking for.
"
1843,CL,"Finally, earnings estimates are being cut across the board with negative revisions far outnumbering positive revisions. I'm continuing to see full-year forecasts for the S&P 500 drop.
"
1844,CL,"Given all this, I believe we will see new lows after this rally ends. How low? I'm sticking to my 6,300 target for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), but in a video recorded last October, I gave a range of 5,600-6,300.
"
1845,CL,"The one positive is that I do think we are moving towards a bottom. It's just a question of when.
"
1846,CL,"After the market finally sets a bottom, we'll have to see what happens. Though a sharp rebound would be nice, understand that a somewhat flat market would also provide plenty of opportunities to make a profit.
"
1847,CL,"Enjoy the rally while it lasts, but understand that the punch bowl is running dry.
"
1848,CL,"Zacks Elite PortfoliosAerovironment (AVAV  -  Free Report) shockingly missed earnings. Fiscal third-quarter profits were 6 cents below the consensus estimate and 10 cents below the most accurate estimate.
"
1849,CL,"To put this in perspective, the company had topped expectations for 8 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, the most accurate estimate was 4 cents above the consensus, meaning analysts were expecting an upside surprise. Needless to say, we sold the stock.
"
1850,CL,"AVAV had been added to the Timely Buys List the day of its earnings announcement. The Timely Buys List consists of Zacks #1 Rank stocks on the Focus List. Therefore, timing issues are not considered. Most companies do not report on Mondays, but occasionally, situations like AVAV will occur. (Just to be clear, AVAV was sold from both the Focus List and the Timely Buys List.)
"
1851,CL,"Colgate Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) was also sold. Earnings estimates were being lowered and the price was dropping. In hindsight, we should have sold CL sooner than we actually did.
"
1852,CL,"No additions were made this week. The Focus List is too small right now and we are continuing to look for new stocks to add to it.
"
1853,CL,"The Markets
"
1854,CL,"The charts suggest the current rally could continue. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) is neither overbought or near resistance. Both of these factors are positive. Enjoy the rally.
"
1855,CL,"Though things are looking better, understand that we are still in a pattern of lower highs and lower lows. This is a bearish pattern as can be seen on the S&P 500 (SPX) chart.
"
1856,CL,"The CBOE Volatility Index (aka the ""VIX"") is near the bottom of its 3-month range. Though a positive development, the index remains very high relative to its historical range. This is important because the VIX measures implied volatility in options prices.
"
1857,CL,"In other words, options traders are still bracing for above average volatility.
