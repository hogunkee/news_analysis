0,AET,"CVS Health (CVS) said it's making progress in the regulatory review of its $68 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) after first-quarter earnings came in higher than analysts anticipated.Both CVS and rival Express Scripts (ESRX) are trying to get their mega mergers approved by regulators, as drug middlemen combine with large insurers in the U.S. to offer a larger suite of medical services under one roof. The two deals are being reviewed by the Justice Department.""We are moving forward on both the regulatory and integration planning fronts in support of a close in the second half of this year and a smooth, efficient integration of operations,"" CVS Health Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said in a statement Wednesday.Earnings were were $1.48 a share, excluding some items, CVS Health said, compared with the $1.41 average of 20 analysts' predictions compiled by Bloomberg.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe shares gained 2% to 69.33 in stock market trading.CVS's proposed takeover of Aetna would bring together around 10,000 CVS stores and the health insurer's 22 million customers. A central plank of the deal is transforming the stores into health hubs where consumers can get care, pick up their drugs, buy some cosmetics, and stay out of the hospital. In a sign of its ambition, last month, CVS hired a senior executive from a startup that specializes in primary-care clinics to oversee expanded health-care services across the company.Aetna reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed estimates Tuesday.""Aetna is firing on all cylinders, validating that CVS would gain pristine health insurance assets should the deal go through,"" wrote Jason McGorman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Concerns that Amazon.com (AMZN) may start directly competing with CVS by selling prescription drugs have receded recently, following a CNBC report in April that the internet retailer had shelved plans too sell drugs to hospitals and other businesses.

1,AET,"A federal judge ruled late Tuesday that the AT&T (T) takeover of Time Warner can go ahead without preconditions. That sent Time Warner and a slew of other media companies sharply higher, while knocking would-be acquiring companies such as AT&T and Comcast (CMCSA). But the antitrust clearance also gives hope to a pair of big health care mergers: CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI)-Express Scripts (ESRX).The gains in media and health care stocks gave a small lift at the open on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 index up 0.1%.Last year, the health insurance merger deals of Cigna-Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna-Humana (HUM) fell apart amid U.S. antitrust objections. Those were horizontal mergers, reducing the number of big insurers. The CVS Health-Aetna and Cigna-Express Scripts deals are vertical, combining different companies along the health care food chain. CVS Health, a drug store and pharmacy benefit manager, aims to team up with insurer Aetna. Insurer Cigna is grabbing pure-play PBM Express Scripts.The AT&T-Time Warner deal also is a vertical merger.

13,AET,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tumbled to a four-year low Tuesday — prodding rival Amgen (AMGN) to also dip — after announcing a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of cholesterol drug Praluent.Express Scripts will list Praluent as its exclusive PSCK9 inhibitor on its national formulary as of July 1. In exchange, it will pay a lower price for the drug. PCSK9 inhibitors, like Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also benefit cardiovascular outcomes.The move is in an effort to expand access to cholesterol drug Praluent, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) said. Some reports suggest 70% of prescription requests are rejected by insurers. That could be, in part, due to price. Praluent and Repatha go for north of $14,000 per year.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer praised the deal in a written statement. He sees the agreement as setting a new standard model for medicines like Praluent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This paradigm-shifting agreement is designed to break the gridlock so that Praluent is finally able to reach patients most in need,"" he said. ""U.S. cardiologists have experienced unprecedented challenges in securing access for Praluent for patients who were clearly appropriate, but were denied coverage.""But investors weren't as keen on the deal. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 0.8% to 301.22. Amgen dropped 3% to 169.28. Sanofi lost a fraction to 39.13.The agreement significantly reduces the documentation necessary to secure Express Scripts insurance coverage for the cholesterol drug, Regeneron and Sanofi said in a press release. Physicians will submit a simplified attestation form to confirm the patient is appropriate for Praluent.Express Scripts also agreed to pass a portion of the savings onto patients enrolled in other plans. Those patients should see lower out-of-pocket costs for their Praluent prescriptions, the companies said.Analysts were largely positive on the deal, though note the specifics of the price cut aren't public. It's likely Praluent will be priced in line with a recent report that suggested it would be cost effective for higher risk patients at $4,500-$8,000 annually, RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.The ""price for volume"" announcement leaves a lot of the financial benefit up in the air, Williams said. The PCSK9 market is particularly attractive given its massive size. But this type of deal could further incentivize insurers to implement complicated utilization processes, he said.Further, if the deal prices the cholesterol drug closer to the $4,500 annual target, it would represent a 50%-plus cut to the net price, Williams said.""Despite this, we do not view this as a pricing 'race to the bottom' given potential for annual compounding and lifetime treatment creating distinct differences vs. the 'price for volume' contracts in the curative one-time-treatment hepatitis C space,"" he added.Now, it's a battle for the other insurers, Williams said. Amgen is in negotiations with payers and will likely leverage its ""expertise in winning contracting agreements"" to seek deals with United Health (UNH), CVS Health (CVS), Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) or Humana (HUM), he said.Amgen estimates the Express Scripts formulary decision will impact 2,000, or 6%, of Repatha patients, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report to clients. But he kept his model on Praluent intact until after the first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday.""Just doing some back-of-the-envelope math, if all 2,000 Repatha patients switched to Praluent on July 1, this would be an $8 million tailwind for Praluent in the second half of 2018 on the formulary decision alone,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

14,AET,"The health care industry is focused on moving care to the lowest-cost setting, with CVS Health (CVS) planning to reinvent its drug stores to offer a broader range of services after merging with Aetna (AET). Yet there's no more convenient or lower-cost place than a cell-phone app.X Teladoc (TDOC) shares have a hit a buy zone this week as the fast-growing telemedicine company said that it's seeing as many as 1,000 flu patients a day this season.Most of Teladoc's appointments are conducted via smartphone app, but they can also be done via computer or over the phone. Doctors can prescribe medicine too, if appropriate.Common conditions include sinus problems, respiratory infection, allergies, urinary tract infection, cold and flu symptoms and many other non-emergency illnesses, according to Teladoc, which also notes the CDC ""strongly encourages patients in communities facing an extreme outbreak of flu to call their doctor before running to an inpatient setting.""General medical ""visits"" cost $40, or about 50% less than a standard doctor's office visit. Teladoc appointments are covered by some plans from Aetna (AET) and other insurers, though limited reimbursement has been a central industry challenge.Teladoc reports earnings after the close on Tuesday, Feb. 27. In January, the company updated its 2018 outlook, saying it expects revenue to grow just over 50% to $350 million-$360 million, with total visits rising by one-third to 1.9 million-2.0 million. Teladoc shares are on a win streak, rising even as the stock market rebound has hit a bit of turbulence.Shares closed above a 38.50 buy point on Wednesday. Shares added another 0.4% to 38.80 on the stock market today. Teladoc has a 93 Relative Strength rating from IBD, meaning the performance and momentum of its stock tops 93% of other companies.IBD'S TAKE: When a stock hits a buy point, a rule of thumb is that investors should only buy the stock within 5% of the breakout point. When the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, leading stocks that hit a buy point have their best opportunity for near-term gains.

18,AET,"Every Amazon (AMZN) flirtation toward the health care industry has sent hearts racing on Wall Street. Yet Amazon appears to be having commitment issues, and others have leapt while Jeff Bezos hesitated. Now comes a possible Walmart (WMT)-Humana (HUM) merger. A Walmart acquisition of the insurer could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon may have trouble matching.A Walmart-Humana deal could potentially transform the health care market for seniors, a demographic that is critical for both companies.Walmart already operates about 4,500 in-store pharmacies and 2,900 vision centers, but a Humana deal would likely accelerate its efforts in developing in-store clinics. The clinics haven't been a knockout success, but Walmart has been learning, wrote Tracy Watts, U.S. health reform leader at Mercer, in a blog post. ""This partnership could foster new ways to bring people what they want and need,"" she wrote, highlighting health care access in rural areas.CVS Health (CVS), which is in the process of acquiring Aetna (AET), is planning to revamp its drugstores to provide more health services. Walmart has greater financial wherewithal to execute the strategy and its supercenters may be a more natural fit for health services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Walmart-Humana tie-up has strategic merits for the retail giant, wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan. He expects it would drive greater store traffic and produce health care cost savings, helping the discounter to keep investing to fend off Amazon.Savings would come from closer ties to Humana, the largest remaining independent pharmacy benefits manager. That would help to reduce drug prices for Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. employees, Astrachan wrote.Humana recently purchased a major stake in the home health care business of Kindred Healthcare, a natural fit for Walmart's home delivery business.Still, there would be challenges. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James sees hurdles to staffing up clinics amid a nursing shortage that's pushing up wages. She also questioned how attractive a merger would be for Humana. Humana has an enviable Medicare position while Walmart has a smaller store base compared to CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Still, Humana shares rose 4.4% on the stock market today, even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all lost about 2% or more. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart lost 3.8% and Amazon skidded 5.2%.So far Amazon's disruptive impact on health care has been all about what others are doing. Since reports last summer that Amazon might enter the retail prescription industry, the shockwaves have set in motion one deal after another. First it was CVS buying Aetna and beginning to offer same-day delivery in major markets, and next-day nationwide. Albertsons grabbed the Rite Aid (RAD) stores not bought by Walgreens. Last month, Cigna (CI) announced the purchase of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest of the pharmacy benefit managers.Options to enter the prescription drug business have narrowed for Amazon but haven't been closed off entirely. One potential avenue would be acquiring Walgreens.In January, Amazon announced a health care venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Health care stocks tumbled amid fear that Amazon would use the same formula that slayed book sellers and department stores. The scariest part: The companies say they have no intent to earn a profit from the effort. Yet they also confessed to a lack of any coherent plan for putting still-to-be-formed cost-saving ideas to work.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Trump Tariffs: China Trade War Just Took This Surprise TurnIs FANG Stock Trade Dead As Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Lead Tech Weakness?The Big Picture: Stocks Do Some Damage Repair, As Patience Now Becomes KeyThe Best Growth Stocks To Watch And BuyHere's What You Need To Know About Spotify's IPO, Due Tuesday

20,AET,"CVS Health (CVS), whose pending acquisition of Aetna (AET) will make it one of the biggeset U.S. companies based on sales, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that topped Wall Street expectations, while guiding lower for 2018 due to its more aggressive spending plans.X The higher investment spending comes as CVS looks to reinvent its stores with a greater emphasis on providing health care services. Minute Clinics, of which there are now more than 1,100, may be equipped to draw blood, CEO Larry Merlo told analysts.Meanwhile, Merlo downplayed the threat from the Jan. 30 announcement that Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) were joining together to try and  lower health care costs and improve transparency.""What that group aspires to is what we're going to deliver"" through the combination of CVS and Aetna, he said, adding that CVS is adopting an ""open-source"" model and is willing to partner with anyone, including Amazon.Estimates: Profit of $1.89 a share, up 10.5% from a year ago, on revenue growth of 3.4% to $47.54 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.92, up 12%, on revenue of $48.4 billion, growing 5.3% from a year ago.Outlook: CVS updated guidance, noting it will get ""$1.2 billion in cash benefits"" from the tax legislation and dedicate at least $275 million ""to additional investments in employees, data analytics, care management solutions, and service offering enhancements.""CVS also will spend ""at least half of the benefits on debt reduction as we look to lower our leverage ratio.""Due to its investments, CVS lowered its 2018 operating profit guidance from up 1%-4% to down 1.5% to up 1.5%.Stock: CVS opened slightly higher, then reversed lower and closed down 5.1% at 70.58 on the stock market today. The stock had been closing in on a 52-week high and a buy point, but got tripped up by Wall Street's seeming overreaction to the vague Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire news. The broad market pullback also has been a factor.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Analysts aren't quite sure if the new Amazon venture is a prelude to its entry into the retail prescription industry, the threat of which was seen as one of the motivating forces behind the CVS acquisition of Aetna. On its third-quarter earnings call in November, CVS announced that it would begin same-day delivery of prescriptions in certain metro areas this year and next-day delivery across the country, which could be a negative for store traffic and nonprescription sales.CVS said its additional investments paid for by tax cuts would initially focus on wage increases for its retail workers, such as pharmacy technicians, who will be relied upon to provide a greater range of services under the new retail model the company is developing. The combination of CVS and Aetna is a new take on the model pioneered by Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which combines the largest health insurer, prescription benefit management and a growing health-services empire that it's adding to with the pending purchase of the medical unit of DaVita for $4.9 billion, its fourth big deal in 2017.Merlo said that CVS and Aetna have begun integration planning and that the deal is on track to close in the second half of 2018.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

AMD is testing resistance at its 200-day moving average, ending just below that level after paring its early 9% gain Wednesday.Express Scripts opened 14% higher after health insurer Cigna (CI) confirmed it would pay $67 billion to acquire the pharmacy benefits manager. Cigna said it expects the deal, which includes $15 billion in debt, to close by the end of the year. A year ago, the courts blocked a proposed $48 billion merger between Cigna and fellow health insurer Anthem (ANTM).Still, the move continues a recent round of massive reorganization in the sector, which included CVS Health's (CVS) $68 billion purchase of Aetna (AET), the launch of Apple (AAPL) health clinics for its employees and a joint venture between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM) to more efficiently provide healthcare services to their 1 million employees.Cigna shares dropped 7% in opening trade.In earnings news, Burlington Stores buttoned up an early 9% gain. The New Jersey-based retailer reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter sales, earnings and same-store-sales above consensus projections. Burlington Stores also raised its full-year earnings guidance above analyst targets. The early gain hauled shares back above their 10-week moving average in the sixth week of a consolidation.Thor Industries' (THO)  fiscal second-quarter sales beat analyst estimates, while earnings apparently came up short of views.

But there's still a strong urge among health care services firms to merge in the face of stiff competition, including an Amazon (AMZN)-led alliance.AmerisourceBergen stock shot up earlier this month on reports that Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina had met with his Amerisource counterpart Steven Collis to discuss a potential acquisition.But discussions have now ended without agreement, though insiders stressed the deal talks could once again resume, according to CNBC. The deal would likely have been valued at more than $25 billion, as Amerisource has a market cap of around $22 billion.AmerisourceBergen stock fell 2.9% to 97.64 on the stock market today, but well off session lows of 93.16 and settling above its 50-day moving average line.Walgreens stock lost 2.1%. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a five-year low.Walgreens Boots Alliance, America's biggest drugstore chain, already owns 26% of AmerisourceBergen.On Jan. 30 a mooted plan by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to form a nonprofit company sent CVS Health (CVS), AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and other big health care companies sharply lower.Last year, Walgreens gave up on an effort to buy all of No. 3 drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores.Grocery giant Albertsons agreed to merge with Rite Aid in a $24 billion deal, acquiring the stores that Walgreens isn't buying. Albertsons, privately held for several years, will go public via this deal.Health care companies see the need for bigger size and scope to rein in costs and compete. CVS last year announced a still-pending $69 billion acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna (AET). CVS Health is the No. 2 drugstore chain and a top pharmacy benefit manager.The CVS-Aetna deal was widely seen as a way to compete with a possible Amazon entry, as well as match up better vs. insurance giant UnitedHealth, which has its own PBM.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen Takeover Talk Follows Sweeping Health Care DealsAmazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase Team On Health Care; CVS, UnitedHealth DiveBiotech And Pharma Industry News

27,AET,"Perhaps no group carries more weight in the health care debate than the American Medical Association, and on Wednesday the physicians group put a big hurdle in front of the Republican plan to quickly repeal ObamaCare and figure out how to replace it later.The doctor's group demanded in a letter that the GOP offer a detailed plan that can be compared to existing law before any vote to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act. Further, the AMA called it ""essential that gains in the number of Americans with health insurance coverage be maintained.""While it's not clear whether the Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump will slow down and detail their ObamaCare replacement plan or charge ahead with a repeal vote as soon as February, some of the stocks that have fared the worst since the election showed signs of life on Wednesday.Members of IBD's Medical-Hospitals group, which had been ranked No. 196 out of 197 based on recent stock-price performance, were big winners Wednesday. Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 8.8% to 16.75 on the stock market today, while HCA Holdings (HCA) climbed 3.6% to 77.13.Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH), two beaten-down insurers with major exposure to ObamaCare's exchange business and Medicaid expansion, also rallied. Centene rose 3.3% to 60.25, while Molina perked up 3.6% to 55.52.UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have already exited most of the ObamaCare exchange markets where they were doing business, saw more modest gains, rising 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon.com of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.Republicans have made clear that they plan to use a procedure known as reconciliation that requires only majority support in the Senate to quickly repeal critical parts of ObamaCare, but keep the law operating for a few years as they design, pass and implement a replacement. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promised an ""orderly transition"" from ObamaCare, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stressing that a priority will be maintaining patient care.Trump, in a Twitter post Wednesday, cautioned Republicans ""to be careful"" about repeal. While Trump has insisted he'll replace the health law with something ""terrific,"" since his election he has hinted that he might keep various provisions.In the letter to leaders of both parties in Congress, the AMA wrote, ""before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies.""The doctor's group added: ""Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform.""The AMA came out in support of Trump's nomination of Rep. Tom Price, a physician, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Price has been a leading advocate of ObamaCare repeal and has laid out his own plan. So it comes as something of a surprise that the AMA now appears to be a significant obstacle to repeal of ObamaCare.The group's support was seen as critical before passage of the 2010 health law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Wednesday's letter clarified its current stance: ""We continue to embrace the primary goal of that law — to make high quality, affordable health care coverage accessible to all Americans. We also recognize that the ACA is imperfect and there a number of issues that need to be addressed. As such, we welcome proposals, consistent with the policies of our House of Delegates, to make coverage more affordable, provide greater choice, and increase the number of those insured.""The AMA's directive that GOP plans don't reduce the number of insured is consistent with what Speaker Ryan and Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway have pledged. Yet, the trick will be to offer detailed policies that achieve and pay for those goals without a divisive intraparty battle.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare Moment

28,AET,"Like the proverbial dog who just caught the car he's been chasing, Republicans are about to gain control of ObamaCare's fate, but with no clear idea what to do with it — or how to bury it.The GOP says that it will take several years to put what would inevitably be called TrumpCare in place, but they don't want the responsibility for overseeing and enforcing ObamaCare — individual mandate and all — in the interim.Republicans have settled on what might be called a hurry-up-and-wait solution to this awkward spot they're in: Repeal ObamaCare as soon as January but wait to sunset most of its provisions until perhaps 2020. Yet a range of policy experts, including some Republicans, and health care industry players have warned that repealing the law without simultaneously replacing it could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules.After a repeal vote, even if the GOP were to keep the individual mandate, relatively young and healthy people may be even less likely to sign up for coverage. Under such conditions, health insurers which have already grown weary of taking it on the chin in the ObamaCare exchanges might not stick around. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) already are exiting most of the ObamaCare markets where they did business in 2016. Anthem (ANTM) has warned that it might do the same.The risk is that large swathes of the country could find themselves with zero individual market insurers in 2018. That would be an emergency, which might prompt the government to try and fill those gaps by essentially bribing insurers to offer coverage or perhaps temporarily removing income limits for Medicaid.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.There are two apparent motivating factors behind the GOP repeal-now strategy: 1) Republicans can claim to have done something substantive for those who oppose the law; and 2) They can justify a vote to cut some ObamaCare taxes immediately, including  a 3.8% tax on investment income.With a 52-48 majority, Republicans would need to keep all but two senators on board to repeal ObamaCare provisions through a procedure known as reconciliation that is limited to tax and spending measures. That means many of ObamaCare's key provisions, such as those guaranteeing coverage to everyone at a price unrelated to health status, would stay in place until there's a bipartisan consensus to get rid of them.At least two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said the GOP should have a replacement plan lined up before repeal, so there's some possibility that a repeal of ObamaCare's major tax and spending provisions won't make it to Donald Trump's desk.Repealing the Medicaid expansion, which provided coverage up to 138% of the poverty level, would be more straightforward to do through reconciliation. The GOP has long sought to deliver Medicaid funding to states in the form of block grants that provide greater flexibility but which are likely to increase at a rate below health care inflation to curb government spending.Hospitals were already in a bad place before the election, but the outlook is even bleaker now. IBD's Medical-Hospitals industry group is ranked No. 195 out of 197 based on price performance, trailed only by gold and solar power.Outright appeal of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and individual market subsidies could cost hospitals $400 billion in revenue and $165.8 billion in income over the coming decade, an analysis for the Federation of American Hospitals and American Hospital Association found.Yet Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, who downgraded Tenet Healthcare (THC) to underperform on Nov. 21, has warned of further downside for hospitals from Medicaid block grants that push states from traditional fee-for-service Medicaid into adopting Medicaid managed care programs. Skolnick estimates that hospitals get 48% less in revenue per patient from Medicaid managed care than fee for service. Likewise, she says, Medicare Advantage pays 17% less per patient than traditional Medicare, suggesting more downside if Republicans turn Medicare into a premium-support program as House Speaker Paul Ryan has advocated. Health insurers, on the other hand, might stand to gain from GOP-style Medicaid and Medicare reform, which could bring an influx of new customers.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'

29,AET,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

30,AET,"Payers like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) are either broadly denying or in UNH's case restricting coverage of Sarepta Therapies' (SRPT) FDA-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Jefferies analyst Gena Wang said Wednesday.Wang slashed her price target on Sarepta Therapies stock to 32 from 46. She has a hold rating on Sarepta stock, which crashed 5.8% to close at 29.98 on Wednesday. Shares are down 17% this year and have traded under their 50-day moving average since late October.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's Exondys 51 in September. The drug targets 13% of the DMD population with confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.But the drug is costly. Sarepta estimates average annual cost at about $300,000 per patient. The majority of patients would be covered by Medicaid and benefit from a 23.1% discount. Private plans would likely get the same discount, Wang said.""There appears to be no legal consequence, according to KOLs (key opinion leaders) for payers (Medicaid and private) to restrict/deny coverage, citing clinical benefit as No. 1 criteria for coverage decisions and FDA approval status as secondary,"" she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta might be diving, but fellow biotech Regeneron has a bright future ahead on eczema drug dupilumab, an analyst said Tuesday. What takeaways are there for the broader biotech sector. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the bigger picture.Outside the Medicaid and private arenas, though, Wang says three of five national and eight of 15 regional managed care organizations (MCOs) have said they would largely deny coverage of Exondys 51.Anthem denies coverage of Exondys 51, saying the drug ""failed to show it improves health outcomes."" Humana has said it would cover Exondys 51 on ambulatory patients provided they remain able to walk. The drug will be approved every six months or as determined through clinical review.Wang notes that it's ""largely unprecendented"" for an FDA-approved drug to be denied or restricted.Aetna (AET) requires the drug be initiated before age 14 and patients be able to average a six-minute walking distance.United Healthcare is mostly unrestricted, but will only cover the drug for the initial four weeks and likely require monitoring after the first month, Wang said.Only certain Cigna (CI) plans cover Exondys 51, she wrote. CVS Health's (CVS) Caremark would cover the drug for 12 months, but then look for improvement in dystrophin levels or a six-minute walking distance before renewal. Express Scripts (ESRX) hasn't disclosed its plans for Exondys 51.Most pediatric hospitals and clinics administering Exondys 51 would be eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, Wang said. Home infusion could potentially cut down on costs, but Wang sees that as a long shot outside of private insurance plans.Editor's Note: Clarifies first paragraph to note the United Healthcare restricts, but does not deny, coverage of the Sarepta DMD drug. Sixth-to-last graph corrects to show that Anthem does not cover Exondys 51 and explains why, and clarifies Humana's coverage of Exondys 51.RELATED:Sarepta Muscular Dystrophy Drug Interrupts 5-Day Biotech Slump'Blockbuster Franchises' Spark M&A Fever For Sarepta, Ariad, Biotechs

31,AET,"UnitedHealth (UNH) reiterated 2016 forecasts and gave a strong outlook for next year, lifting shares of the health insurer after Monday's market close.UnitedHealth expects 2016 earnings per share of about $8, with revenue topping $184 billion. Analysts have seen EPS at $8.01, revenue at $184.06 billion.The health insurance giant gave initial 2017 forecasts above analyst estimates, predicting adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60 and revenue of $197 billion to $199 billion. Wall Street has expected EPS of $9.14 and revenue of $196.55 billion.UnitedHealth also see operating cash flow of $11.5 billion to $12 billion in 2017.Shares of UnitedHealth rose more than 2% in late trading to above 155. Shares closed the regular session down 0.5% at 152.11 on the stock market today.The insurer will discuss its financials at its annual investors conference on Tuesday morning.Shares of rival insurers, including Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM), were little changed late Monday.

The small-cap index on Monday snapped a 15-day win streak.Volume was tracking above the totals at the same time Monday. Winners led losers by 11-to-10 on the NYSE and by 7-to-6 on the Nasdaq.Health care stocks were among the strongest in today's trading, after insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) gave a strong outlook for next year. The stock jumped more than 3% in heavy trading to an all-time high.Other managed-care stocks also climbed. Humana (HUM) rose 1% to the highest level since June 2015. Aetna (AET) climbed more than 2%, setting a 52-week high. WellCare Health Plans (WCG) reached a record high. The industry group, however, remains a laggard; it is ranked No. 117 out of 197 groups. Cigna (CI) is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 142.10 buy point, but it's a low-rated stock.Long-term care, outpatient care, medical services and medical supplies were other heath care industry groups leading the market.Homebuilders rose after the S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller home price index for September rose 0.4% from August, matching economists' forecasts. Home values rose 5.1% from a year earlier, just shy of views. Most stocks in the group remain in consolidations, but keep an eye on thinly traded M/I Homes (MHO), which is near a 24.06 buy point, and KB Home (KBH), which is approaching a 16.67 entry.John Bean Technologies (JBT) rose nearly 2% as it stretched an advance from a pullback to the 50-day moving average in September. The food-processing and aviation-equipment company was discussed in IBD's Stock Spotlight on Sept. 1, while it was still forming a base.

34,AET,"Aetna (AET) narrowly beat third-quarter earnings estimates despite wider losses in its ObamaCare exchange-related business.The insurer earned $2.07 per share, up from $1.90 a year ago and analyst estimates of $2.03. Operating revenue rose 5% from a year ago to $15.74 billion, squeaking past estimates of $15.71 billion.Aetna updated its full-year guidance, narrowing both the bottom and top ends of the range to $7.95-$8.05 per share vs. the $7.90-$8.10 range offered in August.Aetna shares fell 0.2% to close at 110.83 on the stock market today, but had been down as much as 4.1% earlier. The stock is in the middle of a consolidation zone after hitting an all-time high on June 26, following a big run-up that started in the fourth quarter of 2014.On an earnings call with analysts, Aetna management sounded optimistic about finalizing the proposed merger with Humana (HUM), despite the Justice Department's antitrust case that will go to trial on Dec. 5, with a decision expected in mid-January.  The deal would make Aetna the largest Medicare Advantage provider and largest purchaser of prescription drugs. If it doesn't close before Dec. 31, Aetna is supposed to pay Humana $1 billion.In August, Aetna announced it would pull out of most of the ObamaCare exchanges where it is doing business this year, citing growing losses in the business and structural problems with the exchanges' pooling of risk. Still, the company recorded an additional $20 million premium deficiency reserve, on top of $65 million in the second quarter, to account for losses in ObamaCare-compliant policies sold on and off the exchange.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street analysts are warning that Centene and Anthem, two big insurers that are keeping their big ObamaCare presences, may see take a profit hit in 2017 due to increased exchange enrollment. Overall, the company expects to lose $350 million this year in its ObamaCare individual market business. However, pulling out of most exchanges may provide a tailwind for 2017 earnings.Aetna had about 775,000 exchange customers at the end of the third quarter, down from 838,000 at the end of June.Aetna management highlighted its Medicare and Medicaid business as its strongest growth segment: ""Operating results in our government business in particular remain robust,"" the earnings announcement said.Still, the company discussed the loss of some state Medicaid contracts. Lost contracts in Missouri and Nebraska will be a $750 million hit to revenue. Aetna is challenging its loss of a Pennsylvania contract that could cost another $1 billion in revenue. Those will be offset to some degree by wins in Virginia and Nevada.Aetna is the No. 5 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group, but the group is a market laggard, ranked No. 166 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance. UnitedHealth (UNH), fueled by growth in its Optum health services division, is ranked No. 1.Molina Healthcare (MOH), a Medicaid managed care company with a big ObamaCare exchange presence, topped quarterly forecasts after Thursday's close. But it also cited ObamaCare exchange woes. Molina Health, which closed down 0.55% at 57.70 during the regular session, slid 56 after hours.RELATED:UnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceHealth-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political Risk

35,AET,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.
"
36,AET,"President Obama weighed in on Thursday with two ideas that he says will make the ObamaCare exchanges work: Subsidies for the middle class and a public option to keep insurance companies honest and premiums in check.No doubt, providing subsidies to households earning just above the income cutoff at 400% of the poverty level would make some difference. But Obama's prescription is fundamentally flawed because he has overlooked ObamaCare's harsh reality: It's giving a bad deal not just to the middle class but to a wide majority of working-class households.Just 1 in 3 people earning between 150% and 250% of the poverty level, who lack insurance from other sources, are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster if they have a costly medical emergency, an IBD analysis finds. That's based on official enrollment data as well as estimates of the uninsured population by the Department of Health and Human Resources and Kaiser Family Foundation.Households in this modest-income group were supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of ObamaCare because they're eligible for both premium subsidies to help pay for insurance and extra cost-sharing subsidies to keep their deductibles low and their medical bills manageable. Yet 2 in 3 in this group either are uninsured or woefully underinsured, and — even worse — a few million people with working-class incomes are being forced to pay individual mandate penalties, giving up 2.5% of their income or more. In other words, for many modest wage-earners, ObamaCare makes income inequality worse.The Obama administration said this week that exchange enrollment had sunk to 10.5 million at the end of June, down from the 12.7 million people who selected, but didn't necessarily pay for, plans during the open-enrollment period that ended in early February. During the third-quarter, enrollment likely slid to 10 million or lower, consistent with the experience of UnitedHealth (UNH), which reported that its exchange enrollment fell by 6%, or 50,000, to 770,000 between June and September.Given that the fourth-quarter has previously seen big enrollment declines, as people who plan to switch plans take advantage of the law's grace period, it now looks like the Obama administration's worst-case scenario (9.4 million enrollees at year-end) has become the best outcome possible.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again.The extent of the decline, though due to many factors including people getting new employer coverage, is troubling because it's even worse than in 2015, despite the fact that ObamaCare's penalty for going uninsured got steeper. The problem is that millions of modest-income people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to pay a fine during the next tax season (more than a year away) rather than paying premiums right away.Using the best and most up-to-date data, IBD estimates that, among those earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, there are about 2.6 million people who are getting silver-exchange coverage. Meanwhile, roughly 600,000 in the same group are getting bronze coverage; 2.5 million are eligible for subsidies but remain uninsured; and another 2 million are uninsured but ineligible for subsidies because they work full time and have an offer of coverage from their employer.**(These estimates may be on the conservative side. The Kaiser Family Foundation says 4.5 million uninsured people who earn less than 400% of the poverty level are ineligible for subsidies because they're offered employer coverage. Meanwhile, the Obama administration said last year that 40% of the 10.5 million uninsured people eligible for subsidies earned between 139% and 250% of the poverty level.)Let's take the last group first. Probably nobody gets a worse deal from ObamaCare than modest-wage, full-time workers. Many employers have figured out that they can keep a lid on health insurance costs and still dodge ObamaCare's employer mandate penalty by offering ""affordable"" coverage that modest-wage workers find unaffordable. Consider single workers earning $20,000 a year, about 170% of the poverty level. For such workers, bronze-type coverage with a $6,000-plus deductible is deemed affordable in 2016, even if it costs $1,900 — just under 10% of income. That's about five times as much as it costs workers at the same income level to buy subsidized bronze-level policies via HealthCare.gov. The decision by ObamaCare's crafters to exclude modest-wage, full-time workers is both extremely unfair and really bad for the sustainability of the exchanges because it narrows the potential risk pool.Other decisions by the law's architects also shot ObamaCare in the foot. They were so intent on making sure that no one was underinsured that they made cost-sharing subsidies exclusive to people who buy silver coverage. This makes no sense. If people can't afford to pay after-subsidy silver-plan premiums — about $1,500, or 6.4% of income, for a single worker earning $23,500 or about 200% of the poverty level — it's a good bet that they won't be able to afford to pay bronze-plan deductibles of up to $7,150 in 2017. As a result, millions of working-class households have been left with the choice of buying coverage that won't do much to protect their finances in a pinch or paying a fine.On a related nanny-state note, the law's crafters decided to pay the cost-sharing subsidies directly to insurance companies. The size of ObamaCare's subsidies are big enough, but there is no flexibility in how they are used. Depositing some portion of the cost-sharing subsidy in a Health Savings Account to offset some out-of-pocket costs, or using it to reduce premiums, could have achieved much greater enrollment and a healthier risk pool.ObamaCare premiums are set to surge by about 25% this year, not including subsidies, as the high cost of ObamaCare's stunted exchange population is leading UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) to abandon most of the state exchanges where they're doing business in 2016. Ironically, though, higher premiums will mean stable after-subsidy silver-plan costs and outright cheaper bronze plans for most of ObamaCare's subsidized customers.The logical inference, backed up by the weak enrollment seen even before premium increases got serious this year, is that a more economical public plan isn't the answer to ObamaCare's unattractive value proposition for consumers.RELATED:ObamaCare's Invisible Uninsured Hordes Work Full-Time ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

37,AET,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

Late Monday, the enterprise software name reported another quarter of triple-digit earnings growth, along with a 34% increase in sales to $140.5 million.When shares were trading around 53.25 on Monday, a monthly call option with a 55 strike price (Feb. 16 expiration) came with a premium of around 1.40, presenting a trade with downside risk of 2.6% (1.40/53.25). One contract gave the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of RingCentral at 55 for a cost of around $140. If the company's earnings had disappointed, the most that could've been lost on a one-contract trade was $140, the amount paid for the contract.RELATED:Weibo Earnings, Revenue Top; Parent Sina Reports Strong Top-Line GrowthMarket-Leading Cisco, Hotel Earnings On Tap, But Inflation Data Key: Investing Action Plan Twitter Short Sellers Keep Increasing Stakes Even As Stock Rises

41,AET,"While Bank Of America (BAC), Cigna (CI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) all once again earned a spot on the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, the most noteworthy name may be the one that didn't return: Apple (AAPL).X Apple had made the list for two consecutive months as the stock continued its climb from a bottom it reached in May 2016. In January's report, 65 top funds invested a total of nearly $1.8 billion in the tech giant.But with analysts seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales, institutional investors may fear the explosive growth of the past may be coming back down to earth as the company settles in to its new headquarters nicknamed Apple Spaceship in Cupertino, Calif.For the December quarter, Apple beat estimates for sales and earnings, but came up short on iPhone sales and guided lower for the current quarter. Apple's stock has now fallen sharply below its 10-week line in heavy volume, a sign of institutional selling. Apple is currently testing support at its 40-week line.Four stocks on the list received over an estimated $1 billion each in investments from the top funds over the past three months: Bank of America, medical sector stocks UnitedHealth (UNH) and Abbott (ABT), and semiconductor pioneer Texas Instruments.BofA is up more than 20% from a breakout in September, and has shown resilience – and support at its 50-day line – in the face of increased volatility and selling pressure in the general market.Abbott has given back much of the 13% gain in made from the buy point it cleared in December. The maker of generic pharmaceuticals and diagnostic systems is now trading 2% above the entry.UnitedHealth broke out earlier this month, but has pulled back and is now 3% below the 231.87 buy point.Texas Instruments has also been retreating, although it remains about 19% above the 84.34 entry it cleared in September.With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing  increased selling pressure and volatility, many stocks on the list, such as Orbotech (ORBK) and DMC Global (BOOM), have seen their recent breakouts fail.Others, such as the New York Times (NYT), have managed to keep climbing. The ""Paper of Record"" broke out of a double bottom on Jan. 12 and is now more than 20% above the buy point after jumping over 11% on today's earnings beat.After pulling back in recent days, defense stock Hexcel (HXL) is testing support at the 64.03 entry it cleared on Jan. 8.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), which provides engineered wood products for home construction, has splintered recently and is now back below the 29.54 buy point it first cleared on Jan. 24.Modine (MOD) has been holding up better than many other names on the list, although it's had its share of wild price swings. It's currently still trading just within the 23.25-24.41 buy zone.Modine, which makes thermal management systems for the building, industrial and refrigeration markets, initially sank on its recent earnings report, but bounced back into buy range in heavy volume last week.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of stocks being sold, with 59 net sellers (127 funds selling minus 68 buying). Despite that, just like its banking rival BofA, JPMorgan has continued to climb higher.No. 2 on the sell side was Aetna (AET), which had 58 net sellers (96 funds selling minus 38 buying).

43,AET,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales.

Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

44,AET,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

45,AET,"Stock fell out of the starting gates Tuesday, as global markets suffered another day of losses and a new partnership announced by Amazon.com (AMZN) rattled stocks across the U.S. health care fields.XThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.7% as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and ExpressScripts (ESRX) put up heavy losses.The S&P 500 traded down 0.6%. and the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped nearly 0.8%, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) down hard and Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) and Chevron (CVX) among the half-dozen other Dow Jones names clocking early losses of greater than 1%.International markets were also posting losses, as bond markets remained under pressure and the dollar continued its slide. Leading benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Stocks in Europe also showed deepening losses in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX diving furthest, each down 0.8%.The Federal Open Market Committee swings into its two-day meeting in Washington Tuesday morning — the last FOMC gathering over which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will preside. A policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, though no rate hike is expected this time around.Other economic news for the day is thin, with the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for November rising 0.7%. That was unchanged from October's reading, and just above consensus views for a 0.6% gain. The January consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board expected at 10 a.m. ET.Health-care stocks were reacting briskly to news that Amazon would partner with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to chart out new ways to provide health care for their U.S. employees, ""through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""The deal suggested that the ""Amazon effect"" — the impact of deep pockets and massive online scale the company brings to its efforts — could begin to assert an impact on health care and insurance industries, the way it has on retail, shipping and other markets.Amazon dropped 1.3%, JPMorgan slipped 0.9% and Berkshire Hathaway was flat. Amazon shares are extended, almost 17% above a 1213.10 buy point following a breakout in early January.On the Dow, UnitedHealth Group dove nearly 5% in opening action.  Other managed care providers responded similarly, with Anthem (ANTM) down 5%, Cigna (CI) sliding 5%, while Aetna (AET) slipped 3% and Humana (HUM) subtracted more than 2%.Shares also dived among pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chains, with Express Scripts careening 9% lower to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. CVS Health (CVS) crumbled nearly 5%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) fell 5% each.Apple traded down 1%, as news reports detailed the company's plans to reduce production for its iPhone X through March 31. Some reports said this was on weaker-than-expected demand, others said the move was seasonal and occurred around this time each year. Apple spent a third session below its 10-week moving average on Monday, and starts Tuesday in a test of its prior low, from early December — just ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday.Early earnings reports were also a factor in early trade, with McDonald's (MCD) down 1.1% after its fourth-quarter report. Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) dropped almost 3% after its quarterly results.Life insurer MetLife (MET) tumbled 8% after announcing late Monday it would postpone its fourth-quarter earnings report as the company wrestles with a foul-up that potentially left ""tens of thousands"" of workers without monthly pension benefits. The company said it would increase reserves by $525 million to $575 million in order to deal with the problem, and revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the matter.Maxim Integrated dived nearly 7%, reversing much of Monday's 12% gain that followed news reports the company was a possible takeover target for Japanese rival Renesas for $20 billion. In reports after Monday's close, Renesas denied that it was in takeover discussions with Maxim.Callidus Software (CALD) spiked 10% at the open, after announcing German software giant SAP (SAP) would acquire the company for $2.4 billion. Dublin, Calif.-based Callidus operates as CallidusCloud, which provides cloud-based sales and marketing programs.

46,AET,"Health Reform: The CVS Health bid to buy Aetna will ""reshape"" health care, or so headlines would have us believe. Actually, it's a sign that the health care landscape is already being reshaped — by consumers, instead of central planners.Every merger comes with promises that the merger will produce ""synergies"" and that consumers will ultimately benefit, and CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) are no exception.""We know we can make health care more affordable and less expensive,"" is the way CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo put it.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWhether the merger lives up to those promises is something the market should determine. But, unfortunately, there's one thing standing in the way: a handful of antitrust regulators who can block the merger if they think it will prove anti-consumer.Despite its pro-business, deregulatory inclinations, the Trump administration has been far from hands off when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The Justice Department is suing to block AT&Ts acquisition of Time Warner, despite the fact that this is a vertical merger that normally gets blessed by antitrust enforcers.Unlike the previous horizontal merger attempts between Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna — which were largely a response to ObamaCare and which would have consolidated the insurance industry — the CVS and Aetna deal would be vertical in nature.The combined company would have a stronger hand when negotiating discounts with drugmakers, and against the threat of new competitors like Amazon  (AMZN), which clearly has an interest in getting into the health care delivery business.What's most interesting about this merger, however, is that it's a sign of the increasing clout of consumers in the health care marketplace.This consumer empowerment has been the untold story of a successful health reform, most likely because it was based on free market principles and pushed by Republicans against fierce Democratic opposition.X The GOP's Health Savings Account reform let people set up tax-exempt accounts that are tied to high-deductible health plans.The HSA reform was meant to accomplish two things: reduce the imbalance in the tax code that favored employer-provided health benefits over out-of-pocket spending, and reduce health costs by giving consumers more skin in the game.It's worked better than even advocates could have hoped. Just 12 years after HSAs were introduced, these plans now command almost 30% of the employer market. Overall, more than 20 million people are enrolled — twice as many as were enrolled in 2010, according to the insurance industry trade group American Health Insurance Plans.These accounts now have some $37 billion in assets, according to HSA investment advisor and consultant, Devenir, which expects assets to top $50 billion by the end of next year.Unleashing an army of cost-conscious consumers is what's been driving the industry to offer more low-cost alternatives. One study found that employer costs are 7% to 22% lower with HSAs than they would have been with traditional insurance.This is how health care should work, and would work more effectively if the government would get out of the way. Consumers would be free to shop around for the best deals in health care, and keep any savings they realize. Doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmacies would compete to provide the best quality at the lowest cost. Innovators like Amazon would find ways to disrupt the market.And rather than stand pat, companies like CVS would refashion their business to meet the needs of today's consumers.The government should be encouraging this trend by among other things repealing ObamaCare's central planning, opening the insurance market to cross-state sales, expanding HSAs and the like.At the very least, the federal government shouldn't squelch market-driven innovations with misguided antitrust actions.RELATED:ObamaCare's Perverse Economics: Massive Rate Hikes = Lower Premiums For Millions Here's A Health Reform That, Unlike ObamaCare, Is Actually Working CVS-Aetna Deal Approval May Hinge On Trump Antitrust Approach Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

47,AET,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms

48,AET,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap. That follows further signals from China to crack down on Bitcoin mining in that country.The No. 1 U.S. insurer reported before the opening bell Tuesday. UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs. The RS line is not quite at record levels, but rose sharply from the end of May through early December.Charles Schwab is expected to report earnings on Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Tech Stocks Are Near Buys With Strong RS LinesA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?The RS Line Speaks Volumes About Apple And iPhone Chip StocksFacebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'These 24 Top Stocks Are Expected To Report 50%-Plus Earnings GrowthWhen Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

49,AET,"The bitter, long-running fight over ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates is all over but the shouting.The problems plaguing the ObamaCare exchanges as enrollment lags, premiums spike and insurers from Aetna (AET) to UnitedHealth (UNH) head for the exits have reached a critical stage, even as the penalties are about to spike for far too many millions of people who get a bad deal from the law. This year, 8 million people paid the individual mandate penalty — not too far from the 10.6 million who had coverage via the exchanges at the end of June. The status quo won't survive the inevitable political backlash, nor should it. ObamaCare is like a car with a bad muffler: It can keep traveling down the road, even as everyone it passes begs the driver to pull over and get it serviced. The only prospect for preserving ObamaCare, in something that closely resembles its current form, requires not just a victory for Hillary Clinton but a clean sweep for Democrats. Yet continued GOP control of the House now looks increasingly assured, and Republicans are given a solid chance of retaining the Senate as well.Even Clinton has conceded that ObamaCare is in serious need of repair. She has proposed increasing premium subsidies; providing an extra $2,500 per-person tax credit to offset medical expenses; and fixing ObamaCare's family glitch that denies subsidies to the spouses of full-time workers who are eligible for coverage from an employer. Those fixes would cost $103 billion in the first year, according to a new analysis from the Commonwealth Fund.Suffice it to say that there is zero chance that Clinton will get any of those wish-list items from a Republican Congress to help keep ObamaCare — mandates and all — afloat. Clinton's choice, then, will be to deal with Republicans by putting everything on the table — especially the mandates — or to stubbornly cling to ObamaCare's achievements at the expense of 10-plus million people who are getting a raw deal from the law.Those millions include full-time low-wage workers who are denied ObamaCare exchange subsidies if employer coverage is deemed affordable under ObamaCare, even if it is far from affordable. This year, a $20,000 earner who is eligible for ObamaCare subsidies can get a bronze plan for $359 per year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But someone at the same income level who is offered insurance at the workplace might have to pay as much as $1,600 for bronze-type coverage — about 8% of income — or else face an ObamaCare fine. A couple of million spouses of full-time workers, as Clinton has acknowledged, also get a raw deal from the family glitch.ObamaCare has been effective in expanding comprehensive coverage for those earning up to about 150% of the poverty level, but the exchanges' results, even in the modest income tier above that near-poor group, are really disheartening. IBD has estimated, using a variety of think-tank and government data, that only about 1 in 4 people from 150% to 250% of the poverty level are getting silver-level ObamaCare exchange coverage. The other 75% either have bronze coverage with $6,000-plus deductibles that leaves them at risk of financial distress if they get sick; have chosen to remain uninsured even though they are eligible for subsidies; or they're uninsured because they work full-time but can't afford employer coverage.Then there are a few million middle-class individuals who get little or no subsidy from ObamaCare because they earn more than 400% of the poverty level, or earn less but still don't get much help because of a formula that gives little or nothing to relatively young adults earning close to 300% of the poverty level.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked 173 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance by IBD, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, like Veeva Systems and Intuitive Surgical. Use IBD Research Tools to identify potential winners and read this primer from IBD University on timing stock purchases and protecting downside risk.Yet a stubborn embrace of the status quo, as unappealing as that is, may not even be an option for Clinton. That's because by early next year, a federal appeals court is expected to hand down a ruling in the government's appeal of U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling that Obama administration funding of key ObamaCare subsidies violates the House's constitutional power of the purse. Without those cost-sharing subsidies, which dramatically cut deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income exchange customers who buy silver plans, insurers might have to substantially hike premiums yet again.The reality is that ObamaCare subsidies — both premium and cost-sharing subsidies — are big enough to give most modest-income people a good enough deal that no individual mandate would be needed to compel them to buy coverage. The key is giving people the flexibility to buy coverage they want and can afford — even if it's not always the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — with some limitations so that the near-poor don't unnecessarily put themselves on the brink of bankruptcy if they get sick. There are also alternative incentives that would work to keep the middle class from going uninsured. The option of buying the coverage one wants and depositing what's left of the subsidy in a Health Savings Account is one that Republicans support and could actually lead to an increase in coverage among the relatively young and healthy.Likewise, extending equitable subsidies to low-wage, full-time workers that they can use in the individual market, as Republican policymakers have proposed, could expand the ranks of the insured. That approach would naturally go along with the end of employer mandate penalties that are triggered when a full-time worker buys coverage via the exchanges.If Clinton takes office next January, when ObamaCare's next enrollment period is falling flat, as it inevitably will, the writing will be on the wall and Clinton will have to dangle the law's controversial mandates to bring Republicans to the table. That means the only way that the mandates will survive is if Republicans are unwilling to deal. That can't be ruled out, but it's not the most likely outcome. To understand why, just recall the outcry when ObamaCare was about to launch, and millions of people started getting notices that their plans were being canceled. GOP policymakers understand that they can't take away the coverage that 10 million people, many relatively old and not in robust health, have come to count on. That's why they crafted a GOP plan to kill ObamaCare softly, vowing that if you like your ObamaCare plan, you can keep it.

50,AET,"Health Reform: This is rich. Aetna was once a big supporter of ObamaCare, but discovered to its surprise that it was costing the company a fortune. So now Democrats who created this problem are bashing Aetna for being ""irresponsible.""In a letter to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Bill Nelson, Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown — some of the most liberal lawmakers in the Senate — demanded that he explain his company's decision not only to abandon its expansion plans, but to pull out of all but four ObamaCare markets.""We are particularly troubled,"" the senators wrote, ""that Aetna's decision to leave the ACA exchanges appears to have been motivated by the Justice Department's decision to challenge Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana.""This is politics at its absolute worst.It was ObamaCare that pushed Aetna (AET) to seek out this merger in the first place — just as it pushed Anthem (ANTM) to seek a deal with Cigna (CI). The costs involved in complying with ObamaCare's rules and regulations, as well as the ObamaCare-induced merger frenzy among hospitals, pretty much required it.But while ObamaCare was pushing the industry to consolidate, Justice decided to push back, leaving Aetna no choice but to pack up and leave.As an Aetna spokesman explained to Business Insider, ""we are one of many insurers, large and small, that has been forced to reduce its public exchange participation due to an increasingly unstable marketplace.""He's right about that. For-profit and nonprofit insurers alike are reeling from massive ObamaCare losses, which could reach almost $2 billion this year. Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Blue Cross have pulled out of several markets, and more than half the nonprofit co-ops that ObamaCare itself created have since failed.The law is failing with the public as well. As more people find their insurance canceled, their premiums spike, their provider networks shrink, ObamaCare's popularity continues to suffer. The latest Gallup poll finds that 51% disapprove of the law, and far more say ObamaCare has directly hurt them as say it's helped (29% vs 18%).Attacking Aetna shows just how desperate Democrats are to pretend that ObamaCare isn't failing.But it also shows the perils of ""partnering"" with the federal government. As soon as things turn bad, politicians will blame the private companies involved, not the flawed law. In fact, Aetna's past supportive comments about ObamaCare are now being used against it by these senators, as if this somehow provides evidence of the company's bad faith.The answer isn't to look for scapegoats in the private sector for the ObamaCare train wreck, it's to repeal the law and start over with free market reforms that will actually work.RELATED:ObamaCare Conspiracy Theories Are Looking More Plausible By The DayObamaCare Is Destroying The Co-Ops It Spent Billions CreatingObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would

52,AET,"Everywhere we turn these days, we hear people calling for an end to ObamaCare and the imposition of a far-harsher solution to our medical problems: A single-payer system. That's one in which government is the sole payer and provider for health services and the legal private market for health care services essentially disappears.Sound good to you? Before you embrace the idea, you might want to look at what's happening in Britain right now.There, some hospitals are moving to ration care for those who are officially deemed obese — that is, anyone who has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. Oh, and while they're at it, they will also ration care for smokers, too.Why? ""To plug a funding black hole,"" as the British Telegraph newspaper put it. Translation: Britain's National Health Service faces such a serious financial crisis that it now has to deny care to some people, despite its claims of ""universal care."" And who better to deny care for than two of the most despised groups in today's modern society — those who are obese and smokers?This new plan to bar overweight people and smokers from most surgery for up to a year is getting its first tryout in North Yorkshire. But, as Britain's Royal College of Surgeons has warned, rationing will soon become the norm across Britain as the health care system deals with soaring costs and failing care delivery for its patients. And the impact will be broad: The Telegraph, working off population data, estimates more than half of Britain's population will be considered obese in the coming decades.The nightmare stories of bungled care and needlessly dying patients are already legion for the NHS, which is notorious for delivering substandard service to its patients.And already, rationing of other care is being imposed across Britain — including strict limits on cataract surgery and hip and knee operations — to deal with the health care system's bottomless need for more money. For the last year, the NHS lost about $3.2 billion, nearly three times larger than the loss of a year earlier. It now faces a series of wildcat strikes by doctors, and even some hospital administrators are calling into question whether ""free"" universal health care can last.""At this rate, we may see brutal service reductions becoming the norm, rather than just being exceptions,"" said Clare Marx, president of Britain's Royal College of Surgeons.Believe it or not, many on the left want to import this system here — to replace the now-failing ObamaCare.As blogger Stuart Scheiderman reminds us, all the way back in 2009 New York Times columnist and erstwhile economist Paul Krugman lauded the British system: ""In Britain, the government itself runs the hospitals and employs the doctors. We've all heard scare stories about how that works in practice; these stories are false.""Sorry, but they're real — very real.And today, despite the clear failures of nationalized health care, the Democrats are on the verge of embracing single-payer for the U.S. In a sense, they already have. The tragically incompetent and substandard care delivered by the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Service — a disgrace to both populations they ""serve"" -- should be warning enough.Yet, when private health insurer Aetna recently announced it would cease taking part in the ObamaCare exchanges in all but a handful of states after being socked with $430 million in losses, Democrats rejoiced. Aetna  (AET) joined more than 40 other health insurers that have abandoned ObamaCare, which appears designed to destroy private-sector health care.So why did Democrats celebrate? They want single payer. They openly admit it. Back in 2014, when ObamaCare's failures were first becoming clear, Rep. Nancy Pelosi was unfazed: ""Well, of course, I wanted single-payer and I wanted a public option. But that not being in the mix you have to prioritize what it is you want to get over the finish line.""In short, ObamaCare was a scam run on the country. Now, as it fails, we're told we won't have any choice, that single payer is ""inevitable.""""The problem isn't ObamaCare per se,"" wrote Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor for the Clinton administration, in a blog post. ""It lies in the structure of private markets for health insurance — which creates powerful incentives to avoid sick people and attract healthy ones. ObamaCare is just making this structural problem more obvious.""This is a classic example of blaming the victim for your own crimes. Aetna takes a hit of nearly half a billion dollars from a system Reich's leftist pals in the Democratic Party created, and then Reich blames insurers for greed.The Democrats who wrote the ObamaCare law knew they would be destroying the private market for health care. But they don't care. And they don't care to learn from others, like Britain's National Health Service, that have already gone down this dangerous path.Americans would be very wise to heed Britain's warning, and just say no to single-payer.RELATED:Those New Uninsured Numbers Are Not Good News For ObamaCareDo Democrats Know How Radical Bernie Sanders' 'Medicare For All' Plan Is?Check out IBD's complete Politics coverage, including the award-winning editorial page.

53,AET,"Aetna (AET) on Tuesday said it will subsidize the cost of the Apple Watch to select large employers and individual customers in the upcoming enrollment season, a key win for Apple (AAPL) as it seeks to boost its smartwatch for health monitoring.In a statement, Aetna hailed ""a new initiative to revolutionize members' consumer health experience by combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched user experience of Apple products including Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad with Aetna's analytics-based wellness and care management programs.""In addition, Aetna will provide the Aetna Watch at no cost for all of its employees — nearly 50,000 -- ""who will participate in the company's wellness reimbursement program, to encourage them to live more productive, healthy lives.""British health insurer Vitality also this week announced it will subsidize Apple Watch for those who take part in wellness efforts over two years.For insurers, health monitoring devices offer the opportunity to encourage healthier lifestyles for its customers, reducing costs.IBD'S TAKE: The days of massive growth may be past, but megacap techs Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Cisco are cash kings.For Apple, it provides a new opportunity for sales, with health monitoring a potentially huge market.Apple just launched Apple Watch Series 2, with reports that the tech titan is working to expand its HealthKit offerings to transform Apple devices into diagnostic tools, not just monitoring devices.Apple has filed a patent for a heart-monitoring wearable. Apple also have developed several iOS apps with IBM (IBM).Meanwhile, Target (TGT) and Fitbit (FIT) already have a relationship, with Target in September 2015 agreeing to provide free or discounted Fitbit fitness trackers to 335,000 employees.

54,AET,"The Obama administration is illegally ignoring the text of the 2010 health law to overpay insurers by $3 billion and counting through ObamaCare's reinsurance program, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.The Department of Health and Human Services ""may not use amounts collected for the Treasury to make reinsurance payments,"" the legal opinion from GAO General Counsel Susan Poling concluded.The finding could jeopardize a portion of reinsurance payments due to exchange participants to cover a portion of the bills for their costliest ObamaCare individual market customers in 2016.Even though financial losses are already driving UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) out of most ObamaCare exchanges next year, their earnings might take an incremental hit from reduced reinsurance payments. Likewise, Anthem (ANTM), Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH) also could see smaller reinsurance payments than they expect.Centene's latest earnings report says it has $217 million in reinsurance payments coming as of June 30, while Anthem received $753 million in reinsurance payments for the 2014 year. The program is temporary, with payments gradually covering a reduced share of costs in each year and phasing out altogether after 2016.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked 173 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance by IBD, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, like Veeva Systems and Intuitive Surgical. Use IBD Research Tools to identify potential winners and visit IBD University to learn how to time stock purchases and protect downside risk.The GAO opinion adds weight to the argument that Republicans in Congress have made that the Obama administration is ignoring the letter of the law. The 2010 law, officially the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, required insurers to submit a fee, $63 in 2014 and gradually declining, for each individual and small-group customer. Those fees were expected to tally up to $12 billion in the first year, but came in short of $10 billion.Part of those funds, including $2 billion in the first year, were supposed to be directed to the treasury, according to the law, which was likely done as a way to keep the cost of the law down in the contentious period leading to its passage.The GAO opinion notes that HHS ""received $7.9 billion in reinsurance claims (in 2014) and paid these in full, leaving approximately $1.7 billion in collections, which it carried over for reinsurance payments in subsequent benefit years. As a result, HHS did not deposit any amounts collected from issuers into the Treasury.""What happens next isn't exactly clear. Anthem's most recent annual report notes that it received its full 2014 reinsurance payment in the third quarter of 2015, so full payment for the 2015 year may already have been made. In that case, only 2016 payments might be jeopardized.The disputed reinsurance funds add to the huge amount of uncertainty already facing ObamaCare. Not only are premiums set to spike next year, but the government has said its risk-corridor program has no funds to cover insurer losses. Further, a federal judge ruled in May that the Obama administration violated the House's constitutional power of the purse by funding ObamaCare cost-sharing subsidies without an appropriation. That case will next be heard by a federal appeals court.UnitedHealth fell 1.5%, Anthem 1.9% and Centene 2% on the stock market today. Aetna fell 1.1%, Molina 1.5%, while Humana fell just 0.4%.

55,AET,"President Obama pushed the Affordable Care Act as the end of a long debate over recasting U.S. health care. ""I am not the first president to take up this cause,"" he told a joint session of Congress in September 2009. ""But I am determined to be the last.""Seven years later, it's clear that Obama was wrong about that. No matter who wins in November, health care reform will be back on the front burner in 2017.The ObamaCare exchanges have grown increasingly unstable as huge losses lead insurers — including Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) -- to abandon the market.The latest news is that Blue Cross Blue Shield is pulling out of Nebraska's exchange and dropping plans in three of the biggest regions in Tennessee. Before this news hit, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that enrollees in almost a third of the counties in the U.S. will have only one insurance company from which to choose. Insurers that are staying are asking for, and getting, massive rate hikes to cover substantial losses. Phoenix Health Plans of Arizona wants an average 123% rate hike on its ObamaCare plans.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. Overall enrollment in the ObamaCare exchanges this year was half what was expected — and young people aren't signing up at the levels needed to keep the market stable. Nobody expects that to change during open enrollment, which starts in November. Public support for the law is at all-time lows.Even ObamaCare's biggest fans, after years spent denying that anything was wrong, now admit that the heavily regulated insurance markets ObamaCare tried to create are at serious risk of failure.But what form ObamaCare 2.0 will take — and what it will mean for patients, providers, insurers, hospitals and investors — depends entirely on who occupies the White House in January, and who is in control of Congress.Although the issue rarely comes up on the campaign trail, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have vastly different plans for how they will deal with ObamaCare's many shortcomings.In the presidential debate on Sunday, Clinton said she will ""fix"" ObamaCare and that ""reining in the costs...has to be the highest priority of the next president."" But she would keep in place ObamaCare's marketplace regulations and add new benefit mandates to the menu. That includes a requirement that every health plan provide three free ""sick"" visits every year and a ban on charging out-of-network prices for any emergency medical procedures.Analysts say that these new mandates risk adding still more upward pressure on insurance premiums, which are skyrocketing by double digits. Yet at the same time, Clinton says she will crack down on ""unreasonable health insurance rate increases.""The combination of the two will likely drive still more insurers out of the ObamaCare exchanges.To deal with the high and rising deductibles in ObamaCare plans, Clinton wants to add a new income-based refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families for any out-of-pocket costs that exceed 5% of income.Other aspects of her plan would vastly expand government's role in providing direct coverage — at the expense of private health insurance.Clinton wants to push the remaining 19 states to expand Medicaid, which she said would add 3 million people to that government insurance program.""Some states adopted it, and those states have indicated some really interesting public health advances,"" said Patrick Riley, senior health care industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan. ""Hillary will push for that to move forward."" She's also advocated opening up Medicare to anyone 55 and older. An analysis by Avalere Health found that this would make 13 million people eligible for Medicare overnight.To deal with the lack of competition in the ObamaCare exchanges, Clinton wants to resuscitate an idea that liberal Democrats pushed when ObamaCare was being drafted — called the public option for health care. This would be a Medicare-like plan available to anyone in the ObamaCare exchanges.Centrist Democrats scotched this in 2009 out of concern that the public option — which would pay doctors discounted Medicare rates — would drive out private insurers from the market.  And, indeed, liberal reformers saw the public option as a steppingstone to a single-payer health care system.The net effect of all these government expansions would be to shift tens of millions of people from private to public health insurance programs that already cover nearly half the population.Clinton also has the pharmaceutical industry in her sights. She says that, if elected, she would deny tax write-offs for direct-to-consumer advertising, attack ""excessive"" profits, let the government set drug prices for Medicare Part D, and push for more generics.The industry argues that whatever savings these steps might produce would come at the cost of future drug innovation.Overall, Clinton's plans would add about $450 billion in ObamaCare subsidies over the next decade, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. That would come on top of the $1.9 trillion ObamaCare is already on track to spend.Donald Trump has been far less detailed in his reform plans than Clinton. So far, he's issued only a brief two-page outline.Trump says he will repeal ObamaCare and replace it. ""It will never work,"" he said at the Sunday debate. But Trump is sketchy on what he'd replace it with, other than to say he'd push ""Congress to make sure we have a series of reforms ready for implementation that follow free market principles"" and ""create a patient-centered health care system."" In the debate, Trump said his replacement plan would be ""absolutely much less expensive and something that works.""Republicans in the House have already produced a consensus plan, which include getting rid of ObamaCare's complex subsidy scheme and replacing it with an age-based refundable tax credit.Both Trump and the GOP plan have endorsed expanding Health Savings Account plans. HSAs let people put money aside, tax free, to pay for out-of-pocket costs. Since approved by Congress in 2005, they've exploded in popularity. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that this year almost 30% of workers are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan that includes an HSA, up from 17% just five years ago. The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that more than $30 billion worth of assets are in HSA accounts.Trump also says he'd allow insurance companies to sell across state lines. This idea has been a fixture of GOP health reforms for some time, but neither the insurance industry trade group — America's Health Insurance Plans — or the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association have endorsed the idea. And there is some question as to whether it would actually affect choice or prices.Rather than expand Medicaid, Trump and the GOP plan would turn it into a fixed block grant. As it stands, Medicaid's costs are open ended. The federal government shares costs with state governments, giving the states little incentive to hold down Medicaid spending. The block grant approach would give states a set amount of money but also provide them far greater flexibility on how they provide health care to their poor.Hospitals that fought for Medicaid expansion are likely to fight against such changes, analysts say. They backed the expansion believing that it would mean fewer unpaid hospital bills and a better bottom line. But a new Medicaid report from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that hospitals aren't getting much benefit from a bigger program. The CBO found that the additional revenue hospitals get from expanding Medicaid ""is not large enough relative to their revenues from other sources to substantially alter the projected aggregate margins.""Trump has also endorsed fixes that are anathema to the drug industry, including letting the government set drug prices for Medicare and allowing the sale of imported prescription drugs.On the latter point, Trump says that ""allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.""The industry — as well as the FDA — has criticized drug importation on safety grounds. The FDA says there's no way for consumers ""to know whether drugs sold outside the U.S. meet FDA standards.""Whatever the candidates promise, the political realities they would face once in the White House mean neither Trump nor Clinton likely could do much without some sort of bipartisan agreement.Clinton would almost certainly face a Republican House and possibly a GOP-controlled Senate that would still want to repeal the law, not expand it. That means the public option, expanded subsidies, Medicare buy-in and other features are unlikely to go anywhere.If Trump is elected, Democrats in the Senate could filibuster much of his health care agenda. Republicans showed they can repeal most of the law without needing to overcome a filibuster, but getting Democrats to agree to the GOP replacement plan would present a huge hurdle.""The overriding issue is that there has to be bipartisan agreement,"" said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates.That means things like the hugely unpopular Cadillac Tax will likely be overturned, as well as the medical device tax, which even far-left liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren opposes because of the harm it's done to this industry.Beyond that, the two sides aren't even in agreement on what's wrong with ObamaCare, let alone what needs to be done to fix it.Plus, anything more than tinkering will take time to put in place.""It took three years for the administration to get ObamaCare up and running,"" Laszewski says. ""It's going to take that long to launch something different.""Note: This story was updated to include quotes from the Sunday presidential debate.RELATED: Is Obama Pushing Another Illegal ObamaCare Insurance Bailout?ObamaCare Death Spiral: Even Blue Cross Plans Are Bailing OutObamaCare's Working-Class Pill: 70% Marginal Tax Rate
"
56,AET,"Roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual mandate penalties this year totaling more than $3 billion, an analysis of the latest IRS data reveals.Despite the controversy and high-stakes legal battle that has surrounded the individual mandate, the scope of the penalties paid this year has gone unreported by major news outlets as attention has focused on ObamaCare's latest and most glaring problems: weak enrollment, surging premiums, and insurer losses that have provoked the exit of UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most state exchanges.Yet ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate. The root of all of those ObamaCare problems is that far too many people — even those eligible for big subsidies — see the plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine.Another reason for the lack of coverage may be that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen issued two ObamaCare reports to Congress on the extent of penalties paid last year, including one in July 2015, but has been silent about this year's mandate fines.Yet the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service included some preliminary statistics on 2016 ObamaCare mandate payments, officially called the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment, when it issued its below-the-radar annual tax season review on July 7. As of April 30, 5.6 million tax returns included mandate payments averaging $442 per return, compared with 6.6 million tax forms including average payments of $190 at the same point in 2015.More recent data from the IRS wrapping the past tax year show that the final tally for 2015 ObamaCare Mandate fines included payments on 8.1 million tax returns averaging $210 for a total of $1.7 billion.If the final stats for 2016 reflect a similar increase after April due to filings past the initial deadline, that would mean ObamaCare individual mandate payments on 6.8 million tax forms in 2016, averaging $489. Some share of those tax returns will include fines for more than one adult or a parent and child, just as ObamaCare exchange applications often seek coverage for more than one individual. A conservative estimate of less than 1.2 penalties per return yields a rough estimate of 8 million people paying the fine this year.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about two-thirds of the people paying the individual mandate fines will have incomes below 400% of the poverty level, the cutoff for subsidies.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked a lowly 175 of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, including Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks before they stage a breakout in features and lists such as The New America and the IBD 50. IBD also will help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.When the individual mandate has gotten attention recently, it has been because both the law's supporters and critics alike have noted that ObamaCare penalties are too weak to compel healthy people to enroll. In fact, some of the law's proponents on the left are calling for a harsher ObamaCare individual mandate.Yet it's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Even as politicians rail against income inequality yet defend ObamaCare, the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away close to 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.On average, the cheapest bronze coverage this year costs $930, or nearly 4% of income, for 28-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, just over 200% of the poverty level. For someone of modest means, that's a lot to spend for a plan that won't cover much before the deductible is met. Many of the cheapest bronze plans will carry the maximum ObamaCare deductible of $7,150 in 2017.That's why many people may end up turning down coverage that's not much more than next year's mandate penalty of at least $695 per adult in 2017, up from a minimum of $325 this year. Another reason is that the bill for deciding to go uninsured starting in January doesn't come due until the tax-filing deadline 15 months later, so people who are struggling to set aside extra money may put off taking any bitter medicine.Although the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.By far, the people who get the worst deal from ObamaCare and its individual mandate are modest-wage full-time workers, who are ineligible for the law's subsidies if they are offered what the law deems to be affordable care, even if it is in no way affordable.This year, a $20,000 earner who is eligible for ObamaCare subsidies can get a bronze plan for $359 per year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But someone at the same income level who is offered insurance at the workplace might have to pay as much as $1,600 for bronze-type coverage — about 8% of income — or else face an ObamaCare fine.The Taxpayer Advocate Service also reported that 11 million tax returns claimed exemptions from the ObamaCare individual mandate through April of this year, up from 10.7 million a year earlier. Exemptions are allowed for a variety of reasons, including income below the tax-filing threshold, unauthorized immigrant status and coverage deemed unaffordable because it costs more than about 8% of income.
"
57,AET,"The same people who insisted that all was well with ObamaCare over the past three years are now saying that the apparent collapse of the ObamaCare market is just ""growing pains.""A big New York Times feature in May talked about how ""the growing pains of the health care act are frustrating patients.""An article in The Week, titled ""ObamaCare is not doomed,"" said that ""drawdowns might just be the growing pains of a relatively young market, in which providers are still finding their footing and figuring out their strategies.""The Commonwealth Fund's Michael McCue told CNBC that ""like any new business starting out, we're going to have some growing pains.""The basic point these people are making is that yes, there are massive rate hikes, insurers are bailing, competition is withering and enrollment is lagging. But this is all to be expected as this new market settles in.The Los Angeles Times -- in an editorial after Aetna (AET) made its shocking announcement about dropping out of all but four ObamaCare markets -- summed this view up by saying that ObamaCare critics were ""confusing the growing pains of a new market with the death rattle of a failing one.""The Times could not be more wrong.The individual insurance market existed long before ObamaCare came around. In fact, when President Obama signed it into law in 2010, there were 15 million people who bought plans on their own in this market, without any help from the federal government. It was competitive, and premiums for many were low.In fact, as a Government Accountability Office report found, plans were available in almost every state that were far cheaper, and had lower deductibles, than what people can find in an ObamaCare exchange, in some cases even with subsidies.The market had its problems, to be sure, particularly for those with expensive pre-existing conditions, but these could have been fixed without the massive, costly and intrusive ObamaCare machinery.ObamaCare took what was a relatively healthy market and is now in the process of destroying it through government mandates, regulations and taxes.None of this should come as a surprise to anyone, since several states experimented with ObamaCare-style market reforms in the 1990s, only to see the exact same problems: Premiums shot up, enrollment lagged, and insurers bailed amid big losses.But don't call it growing pains. Growing pains are what adolescents go through as their bodies quickly transform into fully grown adults. It's the rapid growth that causes the pain.ObamaCare isn't experiencing rapid growth, or anything like it.The more appropriate way to describe what's going on would be to say that the individual insurance market is suffering from a virus called ObamaCare, which the government introduced thinking it was a vaccine and which is now rapidly spreading and threatening to kill the host.RELATED: 
"
58,AET,"The Obama administration told insurers on Friday that, as expected, they will get a big fat zero from ObamaCare's risk corridor program to offset billions in 2015 losses. But in a surprise twist, the Department of Health and Human Services essentially invited insurers to join in lawsuits against the government so that talks of a financial settlement can get started.That might be positive news for the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which have been treating their risk-corridor receivables as a lost cause, and for Humana (HUM), which says it's owed $542 million under the program. HealthNet, acquired this year by Centene (CNC), is owed $212.5 million for excess losses suffered in 2014 and 2015.The biggest beneficiaries would be Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that have sustained massive losses and the nonprofit health cooperatives that have been driven out of business.HHS confirmed in the memo that any money collected under the risk corridor program for 2015 will be used to shrink its massive $2.5 billion shortfall in 2014, ""and no funds will be available at this time for 2015 benefit year risk corridors payments.""The twist came at the end: ""We know that a number of issuers have sued in federal court seeking to obtain the risk corridors amounts that have not been paid to date. As in any lawsuit, the Department of Justice is vigorously defending those claims on behalf of the United States. However, as in all cases where there is litigation risk, we are open to discussing resolution of those claims. We are willing to begin such discussions at any time.""Yet the prospect of a settlement is sure to stir a backlash among Republicans in Congress. Further, there's reason to doubt whether the U.S. faces much litigation risk based on past precedent. Lastly, HHS has been warning insurers that all risk corridor payments were ""subject to the availability of appropriations"" since early 2014 — well before 2015 premium prices were finalized. To the extent that the U.S. faces any risk of losing in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, that risk would seem to be limited to debts incurred in 2014.Health Republic of Oregon filed a $5 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of insurers stiffed by the Obama administration risk corridor program, but the court hasn't yet granted class-action status, which would allow all insurers to sue as a group.The risk-corridor program, in its third and final year, transfers funds from firms that make ""excessive"" profits to those with excessive losses. (Excessive is defined as more than 3 percentage points of premiums net of administrative and related costs.)Those profits and losses were originally expected to balance out, but because ObamaCare customers turned out to be older and more costly than expected, few ObamaCare plans have been earning excess profits. For 2014, the roughly 50% of excess profits paid to the government came to just $362 million, while the 50% (or more) of excess losses amounted to $2.9 billion.While a number of analyses have found that ObamaCare losses deepened in 2015, and 2016 is shaping up to be a bad year as well, the Obama administration is still calculating how much insurers will have to pay out in excess profits for 2015 and how much they'll be owed for excess losses.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked No. 172 out of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance. But there have been plenty of health-related winners lately. Find out how Veeva Systems helps drug giants get new treatments to market.
"
59,AET,"As it has been doing since the spring of 2014, HHS continued to send mixed messages about making good on its promises. On one hand, HHS said that in the event of a shortfall, the department ""will explore other sources of funding for risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. This includes working with Congress on the necessary funding for outstanding risk corridors payments.""That sounds iffy, at best, which is why UnitedHealth said in its latest 10-K filing with the SEC that ""We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds.""On the other hand, the memo suggests that the government can't duck its liability: ""HHS recognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers. HHS will record risk corridors payments due as an obligation of the United States Government for which full payment is required.""While insurers have plenty of reason to be upset that risk corridors hasn't lived up to their promises, legal precedents raise a big doubt that those insurers are entitled to a court judgment.The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service studied the question and found a somewhat similar case involving plaintiffs who were entitled to funds under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program but were denied their fair share because the appropriated funds had been spent. The court found that plaintiffs couldn't be made whole by funds from the government's Judgment Fund and the only recourse was for the overseeing agency ""to seek additional appropriations from Congress.""RELATED:Health-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political RiskGovernment Survey Confirms Slowdown In U.S. Health Insurance GainsAetna's Exit From Most Exchanges Is Ominous For ObamaCare
"
60,AET,"The nation's progress in getting more people covered by health insurance slowed significantly this year, the government confirmed Wednesday in a report that tempers the Obama administration's signature achievement.About 1.3 million fewer people were uninsured the first three months of this year, driving the uninsured rate to a new record low of 8.6%, according to the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, that progress is a fraction of the earlier gains seen under President Barack Obama's health care law. When the law's big expansion got underway in 2014, the number of uninsured people went down by nearly 9 million.The uninsured rate has been cut by nearly half under Obama's law, but that hasn't been enough to overcome political divisions. The survey estimated that 27.3 million people remained uninsured in the first three months of this year, about 21 million fewer than in 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.The law offers subsidized private insurance for people everywhere who don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a Medicaid expansion geared to low-income adults in states that opt for it. Although a growing economy should also be contributing to coverage gains, experts say the law deserves most of the credit.The uninsured estimates are based on a first-quarter survey and may not fully reflect the extent to which the ObamaCare exchanges have seen a steep drop off in enrollment as the year progresses. As of early February, 12.7 million people signed up for the exchanges, but there were only 11.1 million paying customers. By the end of June, reports from major public insurers including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina (MOH) suggest enrollment fell to about 10.5 million.Premiums are expected to surge in 2017 as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana all dramatically scale back their exchange presence. That could keep a lid on enrollment going forward, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies.In another notable finding, the report said the share of working age people and dependents with high-deductible health insurance has increased and now stands at 4 out of 10. Such plans require patients to pay a sizable share of their medical bills before insurance kicks in. The survey defined that as at least $1,300 annually for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for a family.The trend toward high-deductible plans started before Obama took office but advanced during his tenure as employers sought to limit their costs. In 2010, only about 25% of people under age 65 were in such plans. Policy experts credit rising deductibles for helping to restrain overall health care spending, but employees generally see that as a cost shift to them. Polls suggest the trend has undercut support for Obama's health care overhaul.The administration accentuated the survey's positive finding that the uninsured rate hit a new low.""Our country's march toward improving access, quality and affordability in health care goes on, and today's numbers show that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to drive historic progress,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.The slower progress registered in the CDC report echoed recent findings from a major private survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.The government survey found 8.8 million fewer uninsured people in 2014. The following year, 2015, there was a reduction of 7.4 million. That compares with 1.3 million fewer uninsured people in the first three months of this year.The numbers for 2014 and 2015 are for full calendar years. But the new figures for the first three months of 2016 are considered a reliable indicator for the rest of the year. That's because the health care law's open enrollment deadlines drive sign-ups early in the year.The upcoming 2017 sign-up season looks tough, with sharp premium increases in many communities and a dwindling choice of insurers. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised to help the health care law regain its momentum, while Republican Donald Trump would make good on the GOP's vow to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a new program yet to be defined.Some independent experts said the survey suggests that the health care law is approaching its limits, absent a change.""The share of the population without health insurance is lower than it's ever been ... but further gains are getting harder and harder to achieve,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The pace at which people are getting newly insured has noticeably slowed.""""Low-income adults have come the farthest, but still have the farthest to go — nearly 25% of this population is uninsured,"" said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Covering more low-income adults is hindered because 19 states are still refusing the law's Medicaid expansion.""Multiple initiatives are needed to have a major impact on further reducing the uninsured population,"" said Paul Hughes-Cromwick of the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a research and consulting group.

61,AET,"AmerisourceBergen (ABC) stock shot up late Monday on a Wall Street Journal report that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is in early talks to acquire the drug distributor.X That follows a late 2017 deal by drug store-and-pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health (CVS) to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET). That CVS-Aetna deal was seen as a pre-emptive move to head off competition from Amazon.com (AMZN).

"
62,AET,"Results from insurer Centene (CNC), by far the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, reveal that paid national enrollment almost certainly increased in 2018 compared to a year ago, defying predictions that President Trump's actions would lead to a sizable drop.X Centene said on a Tuesday earnings call that it now has more than 1.6 million paid exchange customers, well above the 1.4 million-plus that the company indicated to investors on Jan. 8.The unexpected surge in customers didn't result from late signups — since enrollment ended in most markets on Dec. 15 — but from a much bigger share of those who signed up following through and paying their premium.Shares of Centene jumped 4.3% on Tuesday and added another 0.7% on the stock market today, boosted by better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and an improved outlook, thanks to ObamaCare enrollment and tax cuts.Centene is ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends, trailing only Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH). With UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) all exiting the ACA exchanges, and Anthem (ANTM) greatly scaling back its presence, the door has been opened for Centene, which has traditionally catered to the Medicaid population, to seize a leadership position.Fears of a substantial enrollment decline were fueled by the Trump administration's adoption of a much earlier signup deadline and its gutting of the advertising budget for HealthCare.gov, along with Republicans' successful effort to repeal the individual mandate to buy coverage or pay a fine.Ironically, the unexpected strength in enrollment resulted from Trump's decision last fall to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized on advice from Urban Institute scholars to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that turned attempted sabotage into a life raft.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Instead of raising premiums for all customers in response to the loss of cost-sharing subsidies, as feared, insurers piled all of their extra expense onto silver plans, sending only silver premiums skyward.But while Trump ended the cost-sharing subsidies for insurers, a separate tax-credit subsidy remains in place to offset the cost of premiums that individuals pay.And because those premium tax credits are based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plans, the size of those subsidies soared, which is why many more people can get free high-deductible bronze coverage in 2018 than in prior years. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 4.5 million uninsured could get bronze policies this year for no cost.Not surprisingly, anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in the take-up of bronze plans. In Connecticut, bronze signups went from 25% of the total in 2017 to 35% in 2018.Typically, somewhere between 70% and 80% of people selecting Centene plans during the open-enrollment period would eventually pay a premium, CEO Michael Neidorff said on Tuesday, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.But this year, he noted, ""we had a much higher percentage convert and pay the premium.""Given that the number of people signing up for exchange coverage came in at more than 96% of last year's total – 11.8 million vs. 12.2 million a year ago, according to ACASignups.net – the experience of Centene, whose large presence makes it a strong indicator of national trends, suggests that paid enrollment will top last year's total of 10.2 million.The wider availability of free bronze plans surely goes a long way toward explaining the higher share of enrollees who paid the premium they owed – if they owed one. The higher subsidies also likely enabled more people to buy lower-deductible gold plans for little more than the cost of silver. California reported a big increase in the take-up of gold plans, with a more modest increase in bronze coverage.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.Before McCain spoke, the Medical-Managed Care industry group was down about 5% on the week, putting in No. 194 among 197 IBD industry groups.The last-ditch repeal bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would shift ObamaCare funding to the states via block grants — through a formula that advantages states which didn't expand Medicaid, while sticking it to states that did. Including a cap on growth of per-beneficiary Medicaid subsidies, the bill would cut federal outlays by about $200 billion from 2020-2026.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass legislation using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. Extending the ObamaCare-repeal effort is unlikely because it could make tax reform more difficult.RELATED:Wall Street Is Taking The Latest ObamaCare Repeal Push SeriouslyStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths
"
66,AET,"TrumpCare is back and could become the law of the land next week.While the coming vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare could go either way, Wall Street is taking this latest GOP effort seriously. Investors are bailing on health insurance stocks such as UnitedHeath Group (UNH) and Centene (CNC), while hospital stocks continued to sag.The biggest ObamaCare players were the hardest hit, with Centene sinking 5.1% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) down 5.9%. Both Centene and Molina hitched their fates to ObamaCare in a significant way, as the Medicaid managed-care companies seized the opportunity to enter the individual insurance market.Both stand to be hurt if the new GOP bill from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy can get through Congress by Sept. 30. The clock is ticking because passage depends on using budget reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Once the 2017 budget resolution expires on the last day of the fiscal year, the GOP would have to start from scratch.While the Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet scored the bill, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Cassidy-Graham would cut ObamaCare funding by $239 billion from 2020 through 2026, while killing the law's subsidies and sending the money to states, which would have to figure out how best to spend it, free from much of ObamaCare's regulations.On top of that, Medicaid would impose a cap on costs per beneficiary, lowering spending by $175 billion over the same span. In 2026, the total cut in funding under Cassidy-Graham would amount to $80 billion.Even insurers that don't rank as big fans of ObamaCare saw their stocks come under pressure on Tuesday. Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 1.8%, while Humana (HUM) lost 3.4% and Aetna (AET) 3.1%. UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna all traded at or just below their 50-day moving averages, an area of key support.IBD'S TAKE: While managed-care stocks have been solid performers lately, they aren't acting well right now. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for near-term advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 44% this year.Among hospital stocks, HCA Healthcare (HCA) fell 1.8%, close to an eight-month low, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) dipped 0.7%, losing ground for a third straight session.One stock that stands to benefit from the legislation is Healthequity (HQY), which provides technology that lets consumers manage their health savings account, whose limits would be increased under Cassidy-Graham. Shares of Healthequity rose 3.5%.Investors seem to have been caught by surprise by the sudden revival of TrumpCare's prospects. Even President Trump tweeted the other week that it was time for the GOP to move on from repealing ObamaCare and focus on tax reform.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

67,AET,"Six months after President Trump embraced ""our wonderful new Healthcare Bill,"" and a month after it was last left for dead, Republicans are down to just 18 days to repeal and replace ObamaCare.XWhile TrumpCare has reemerged in an undead state before, zombies don't move that fast, and the fiscal 2017 budget resolution allowing the GOP to do an end-run around a Democratic filibuster is set to expire at midnight on Sept. 30.Trump, with his focus turned to tax cuts, appears to lack enthusiasm for one last massive push. Over the weekend, he tweeted: ""Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!""He added: ""Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!""While the final whistle hasn't blown, it seems pretty clear that two big winners have emerged from the Republicans' defeat: Bernie Sanders and his vision of Medicare for all, and — if stock prices are an accurate gauge — the health insurance industry.IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group is one of the best-performing sectors since Election Day, rising 40% compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index.Centene (CNC), the biggest remaining player on the ObamaCare exchanges and a major participant in the Medicaid expansion, is currently ranked No. 1 in the managed care group by IBD based on stock performance, earnings, revenue, and profit margin trends. Centene announced a $3.75 billion deal to buy Fidelis Care, expanding its reach into New York.The four companies that had their mergers blown apart early in 2017 — Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — all are up in excess of 40%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the biggest of the bunch and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, is up 38%, vs. 21% for the overall average.On Tuesday, managed care stocks lagged the major indexes, led lower by Anthem, which signaled it may pull out of more ObamaCare exchange markets in 2018. Insurers have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.IBD'S TAKE: Most managed care stocks are too extended to chase, meaning they're at least 5% beyond a buy point, the optimal point for acquiring shares to maximize chances for a near-term gain. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 60% this year.What is interesting is that the gains come even as support for single payer is on the rise and Sanders rails that the health care system is failing because ""it is largely designed not to provide quality care in a cost-effective way, but to make maximum profits for health insurance companies,"" as well as drug and medical equipment companies.Managed care investors aren't yet worried about single payer because it probably can't happen before 2021, may not happen at all because its financing will be controversial, and even if it does, it still doesn't rule out a big role for private insurers. After all, many states have turned their Medicaid programs over to managed care companies, and Medicare Advantage is one of the reasons profits are surging for Humana and others.On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his Medicare-for-all legislation, and he's no longer a voice in the wilderness. Four potential 2020 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have signed on as co-sponsors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and New York's Kristen Gillibrand. Even relatively conservative West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday that single payer is worthy of consideration.The lack of popularity for the Affordable Care Act and the horrific polling for the GOP TrumpCare plans have left an opening for Sanders, whose big unveiling may even overshadow the expected release of new repeal-and-replace legislation from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky both threw cold water on prospects for the new bill on Monday. Paul, whose state of Kentucky stands to be among the bigger losers under the Graham-Cassidy plan, said that the bill would probably be worse than doing nothing.Even as some Republicans push for one more attempt at killing ObamaCare, others in the GOP are negotiating with Democrats on a plan to shore up the exchanges to avoid a premium spike in 2018.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks Trump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman Sachs Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

68,AET,"The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs during the week, but they ended little changed. Apple (AAPL) fell sharply amid iPhone and Apple Watch concerns while oil prices topped $50. The Federal Reserve will start paring its balance sheet and stuck to its hawkish plan for raising interest rates, pushing Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks toward buy points. Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced a big defense takeover.The Dow industrials rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.3%, after all three major averages hit record highs during the week. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed. Apple was a drag on the major indexes but oil stocks rallied with crude futures while bank stocks climbed on a hawkish Fed and rebounding Treasury yields. Some recent breakouts, such as Apple and Tesla (TSLA), faltered during the week. Several other stocks topped buy points, but not by much and in light volume.Crowds were light for the iPhone 8 as it went on sale Friday, confirming reports of light pre-orders, as many customers await the high-end iPhone X due Nov. 3. Apple admitted that its cellular-enabled Apple Watch Series 3, which also went on sale Friday, has connectivity problems. Apple shares fell 5% to 151.89, below a flat-base buy point of 156.75 and its 50-day line.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google announced that it will pay Taiwan-based HTC $1.1 billion to acquire and staff assets to make Pixel smartphones. Google's latest Pixel phones are expected to be revealed in early October.RELATED:Apple iPhone X Production, Supply Likely Delayed: AnalystThe Federal Reserve, as expected announced that it will start to pare its $4.5 trillion balance sheet starting in October. Policymakers also stuck to their plan for four interest-rate hikes by the end of 2018, including one more this year. That raised market odds of an increase by December. Treasury yields continued their rebound, helping Citigroup (C), Bank of America and other big banks hit or near buy points.RELATED: The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltNorthrop Grumman (NOC) announced it would buy Orbital ATK (OA) for $7.8 billion in cash and assume $1.4 billion in debt. That comes out to $134.50 a share for Orbital. The acquisition will give Northrop key missile-defense assets as Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Boeing (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The deal could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and will be a test case to see if the Trump Administration and Pentagon still have concerns over the size of prime contractors.RELATED:Why The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop GrummanOPEC and noncartel members did not extend or deepen production cuts at Friday's meeting, but a move for increased monitoring and other steps hinted that production would not soar in 2018. Crude futures rose above $50 a barrel earlier in the week on Iraqi hints of extended output curbs, and they closed above that key level. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 4.59 million barrels in the latest week according to the Energy Information Administration, more than expected. U.S. gasoline supplies fell by 2.125 million barrels and distillates fell by 5.69 million barrels. Domestic crude production rose to 9.5 million barrels per day, almost back to pre-Hurricane Harvey levels.RELATED:Oil Ends Above $50 As Iraq Hints At Extension Of OPEC Output CutFedEx (FDX) took an earnings hit from Hurricane Harvey and a June cyberattack on its Dutch TNT Express unit. Adjusted profit fell 13% from a year ago to $2.51, as revenue climbed 4.3% to $15.30 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Wall Street analysts had expected EPS of $3.17 and revenue of $15.37 billion. The delivery giant said it would have posted EPS of $3.32 minus the adverse events. It also lowered full-year guidance. But FedEx shares rose 2.4% for the week to 220, flirting with a 220.09 buy point off a flat base. The shipper is bumping up rates for many services by 5% starting Jan. 1.Shares in T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) jumped 4.7% and 10.8%, resectively, amid reports that their stalled merger talks may be back on and near an agreement. Shares in cell tower operators down. The wireless operators are said to be looking at an all-stock deal that would give Deutsche Telekom control. They have yet to agree upon an exchange ratio based on each company's valuation. But Sprint and T-Mobile shares rose again early Friday on a report that the telecoms were near a deal on terms.Adobe Systems (ADBE) earnings rose 47% in fiscal Q3 as revenue swelled 26% to $1.84 billion, both above views. But investors focused on lower-than-expected bookings for Adobe's Experience Cloud business, which includes online marketing, advertising and analytics services. Adobe blamed longer sales cycles for closing deals worth over $1 million each. Adobe guided higher on earnings, but in line on sales. Adobe shares fell 3.9%, but are up sharply in 2017.RELATED:Adobe Stock Dinged By Marketing Software Bookings MissKohl's (KSS) will start processing Amazon (AMZN) returns for free at 82 locations across Los Angeles and Chicago, starting in October.

Kohl's shares rose 2%.RELATED:Sign Of The Times: Kohl's Will Start Accepting Amazon ReturnsUnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) fell for much of the week as investors started seeing a serious chance that the GOP's last-ditch ObamaCare repeal plan could actually pass. Medicaid-focused insurers Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), which have made a big push in the ObamaCare exchanges, fell the most. But shares rebounded somewhat Friday after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he'd oppose the bill, making passage far less likely.Big news moved Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS) into the stratosphere last week, as Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI) toppled on FDA reports regarding their drugs while Versartis (VSAR) crashed on a failed drug trial. Alnylam spiked 52% Wednesday after reporting strong late-stage data for a rare-disease drug, prompting rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) to plunge 8.8%. Adamas, on Tuesday, hit a 20-month high after announcing it will charge $28,500 per patient per year for its Parkinson's drug, Gocovri. Aerie, though, dipped to a three-week low after the FDA set a committee review date for its glaucoma drug, Rhopressa. Meanwhile, Intercept neared a four-year low Thursday after the FDA warned of liver damage and death related to its drug, Ocaliva. Versartis cratered Friday after its drug for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency didn't meet a late-stage trial goal.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) got the nod from regulators to purchase 1,932 Rite Aid (RAD) stores, less than what it agreed to in June, along with three distribution centers and other assets for $4.375 billion in cash. The announcement came nearly two years after Walgreens first announced a deal to buy Rite Aid. But its plans repeatedly ran up against concerns that the combined drugstore operator would harm competition. Drugstore stocks came under pressure amid fresh reports that Amazon (AMZN) might enter the pharmacy business.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) disappointed investors with its targets for 2020. Best Buy stock tumbled 8% following its first investor meeting in five years. Best Buy's implied profit margins in its four-year outlook were below Wall Street's estimates. Analysts also expressed doubts that Best Buy could reach its promised annual sales growth of about 2%.Japanese video game firm Nintendo (NTDOY) could be poised to enter China with its Switch console, according to news reports. Nintendo recently revealed that it is bringing Tencent's (TCEHY) ""Honor of Kings,"" one of China's most popular games, to the Switch console this winter.

69,AET,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting.

71,AET,"After a long absence, Apple (AAPL) made IBD's latest monthly list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, as it gets ready to unveil its latest iPhone, with one analyst saying the launch may be delayed due to production issues.X The tech giant was joined by a slew of medical sector stocks, including managed care providers UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), as well as leading biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN) and Heico (HEI) also made the list, as tensions with North Korea and anticipated defense spending increases are expected to drive demand.Over the last three months, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each in four stocks on the list: UnitedHealth (99 funds, $1.39 billion invested), Apple (85, $1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) (76, $1.25 billion) and Celgene (96, $1.07 billion).The heavy institutional buying has helped push Apple, Electronic Arts and Celgene into new buy zones, and has already lifted UnitedHealth beyond buy range.Seeing that stocks on your watch list are being bought by mutual fund managers with a proven track record of success is a positive sign, since it means they've done their due diligence and like what they see.But it doesn't mean the stocks are necessarily in or near a proper buy zone right now. More time may be needed for them to set up a proper buying opportunity.In addition to Apple and Celgene, stocks on this month's list that are forming a base or within buy ranges also include Boeing, medical software firm Cerner (CERN), and casino operator MGM Resorts (MGM).Apple has the distinction of making the new buys screen and also topping the list of new sells this month. The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone. On Monday, Amgen jumped past a 182.70 entry in heavy volume. The buy range extends to 191.84.RELATED: Why Mutual Fund Managers Are Betting On Tech, 'Quality' StocksFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

72,AET,"Spending on health care services surged a greater-than-expected 6.9%, or $37.1 billion, from a year ago in the second quarter, according to Census Bureau data released Thursday. The acceleration in spending growth is a worrying sign after a period of moderating growth that followed an ObamaCare-fueled rise amid Medicaid and individual-market coverage expansions.The obvious concern is that the latest surge isn't tied to more people getting coverage, but to faster per-person cost growth.The Altarum Institute, which tracks health spending, had expected a 5.3% year-over-year rise in spending on health services, equal to the year-over-year growth in the first quarter and consistent with a gradually moderating trend.The surprising re-acceleration in spending, if sustained, could create more headaches for the health care sector, which has already felt rising political heat due to drug pricing and spiraling premiums for ObamaCare exchange coverage.Democrats are pushing a government insurance option competing alongside private insurers as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have pulled back from the non-group insurance market. Higher spending growth also could step up the pace at which the ObamaCare-created Independent Payment Advisory Board will have to propose cost cuts to restrain Medicare's growth. Meanwhile, both presidential candidates have talked about letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, and Hillary Clinton has been quick to capitalize on the drug-pricing controversy, leading criticism of Mylan (MYL) for its EpiPen price hike.Political risk in a hard-to-predict election year has helped make health care the worst-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors this year, with just a 1% gain, investment strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research noted earlier this week. ""The sector has been haunted by controversy over egregious drug pricing, insurers pulling out of ObamaCare, and some disappointing news on the new drug front,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Overall, health care has lagged other stock sectors this year, but there have been plenty of health-related winners, including Intuitive Surgical, Veeva Systems and Healthequity. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks — before they stage a breakout. IBD writes about the best investment candidates in features such as The New America  and includes them in lists such as the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders. IBD also will even help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.The 6.9% in spending on health care services reported in the Census' Quarterly Service Survey easily eclipsed the year-over-year growth reported since the recession — with one exception. The first quarter of 2015 saw 7.7% growth in health services spending, but that reflected the ObamaCare enrollment gains that, partly due to the HealthCare.gov technology glitch, didn't noticeably begin to push up health expenses until the second half of 2014. The services report doesn't detail prescription drug spending or health insurance spending.Hospital revenue jumped 6.6% from a year ago to $272 billion, even as the number of inpatient days dipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, hospital expenses on labor, supplies and overhead rose a more moderate 5.4%, signaling increased profitability. In this case, though, improvement is due to the tax-exempt sector. For-profit hospitals, such as those run by Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), actually saw expense growth (10.3%) outpace revenue growth (8.3%). Yet for-profit hospitals still have higher profit margins than the tax-exempt sector.Spending on ambulatory care services jumped 7.3% from a year ago to $244.3 billion. Within that category, outpatient care center spending rose 9.2% and home health care services 6.8%. Medical and diagnostic labs showed relatively slow 2.7% growth. Spending at nursing and residential care facilities rose 6.3%.Overall, spending on health care services accounted for about 26% of total growth in services spending. That makes six straight quarters in which health care has accounted for at least one-fourth of the total growth in year-over-year services spending — twice as big of a share of growth as that seen as recently as the second quarter of 2014.

73,AET,"Health Reform: Amid skyrocketing premiums and huge losses, Aetna has decided not only to cancel its expansion plans, but to pull out of all but four ObamaCare markets. Who could have predicted such problems? Turns out that Aetna's own CEO saw it coming back in 2012.While Mark Bertolini has often had nice things to say about ObamaCare, he was also clear and direct in his warnings about the law's failings.At an investor conference in late 2012, Bertolini warned that ""in some markets,"" ObamaCare premiums could ""go as high as 100%. And we've done all that math. We've shared it with all the regulators. We've shared it with all the people in Washington that need to see it. And I think it's a big concern.""Bertolini was mocked for this prediction. ""This just seems silly,"" is how Gary Claxton, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, put it. Liberal commentator Rick Ungar, writing in Forbes, said Bertolini was just ""trying to freak out the public.""Earlier in 2012, Bertolini warned that the law's individual mandate was too weak to be effective.""Even as it exists today, the individual mandate is weak and still presents problems because the penalty is so low,"" he told Reuters. ""If you get rid of it, I don't know that it makes all that much of a difference.""The year before, Bertolini had warned that ""there isn't anyone in Congress or the White House who thinks (the law) can stand without the individual mandate."" That's because, he said, without an effective mandate, ObamaCare's risk pool would be too old and too sick to be sustainable.In 2014, he complained that ObamaCare is ""not an affordable product"" for many people and that it didn't fix the underlying problems driving high health care costs.He also said that year that Aetna could be forced out of the market if they couldn't get double-digit premium hikes approved. ""Are they going to be double-digit (increases), or are we going to get beat up because they're double-digit, or are we just going to have to pull out of the program?"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in January 2014. ""We really don't have a good view on that.""Earlier this year, he warned that ""we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges"" and that ""we remain concerned about the overall stability of the risk pool.""Now, in explaining why Aetna not only canceled its expansion plans -- earlier this year, it said it would be operating in 20 states -- but is pulling out of all but four states, Bertolini says that it's losing too much money because ObamaCare hasn't attracted enough young people.""Providing affordable, high-quality health care options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool,"" he said.While Bertolini's dead-on accurate concerns were papered over, anytime he praised ObamaCare it was treated as evidence that the law was working. Like when he said earlier this year that ""we like the program, and we think it's an appropriate effort."" And there was plenty of attention given when he announced that Aetna was planning to expand into five new markets in 2017 as UnitedHealth and others pulled out.To be sure, even as he announced his decision to abandon most of ObamaCare, Bertolini was praising the exchanges, calling Aetna ""a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured.""So you can't argue that Bertolini, despite his misgivings, didn't give ObamaCare a shot.But you can say that Bertolini shouldn't be surprised by what's happening right now. Neither should anyone who was paying attention to his warnings over the past four years.RELATED:

74,AET,"Now that Aetna (AET) has joined UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) in pulling back from the ObamaCare exchanges, the field is wide open for Centene (CNC) to make big enrollment gains. But that's not necessarily going to make Centene shareholders happy, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte suggests in a new report.Gupte downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform on Monday but maintained an 80 price target. Shares dived 4.8% to 65.3 on big volume, though the stock found support at its 200-day moving average.Centene stock fell below its 50-day line in late August, along with Aetna, UnitedHealth and several other health insurers. Humana also is trending lower, but is still just above its 50-day and 200-day lines.Centene is turning a profit on its ObamaCare exchange business, which is an offshoot of its Medicaid managed care business. So why wouldn't even less competition on the exchanges yield even bigger profits?The potential risk for Centene and other insurers left standing is that they might inherit a lot of high-cost patients from the insurers who are pulling back from the exchanges amid financial losses. That risk could be exacerbated by the end of ObamaCare's reinsurance program, which is in its final year of covering a portion of the medical bills incurred by the highest-cost patients.Among a number of reasons for the downgrade, Gupte cited ""potential for downside risk from the HIX (health insurance exchange) exits by multiple plans and phaseout (of reinsurance in) 2017.""Gupte also said that ""margins in the core Medicaid business look to have peaked"" for Centene.That view seems consistent with the recent news that the government's cost for the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion exceeded per-person estimates by 49% in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Learning when to sell a stock is as important as knowing when to buy. When Centene shares staged a breakout then fell below the buy point on July 26 after its earnings report, that triggered a key IBD sell signal. For a primer on protecting your profits and limiting your downside, visit IBD University.Gupte also noted some issues particular to Centene, involving a Pennsylvania Medicaid managed care contract that's now expected to produce losses in the near term and breakeven-at-best results from its Medicare Advantage expansion in four states next year.Bottom line: Gupte sees increased top-line growth, but with margin compression and earnings growth of 12% a year through 2019, down from prior expectations of 14%.Gupte lowered projected earnings for 2017 by 9 cents to $4.56 a share, well below the $4.87 average estimate of analysts.Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another Medicaid managed care player that's fared better than most on the ObamaCare exchanges, gave up early gains as Centene plunged, but ended with modest losses.

75,AET,"""I will predict that within that year — now I may be wrong on this — but within the immediate future the Democrats are going to throw their hands in the air and say, 'It's not working. It's unaffordable. And we have to go to a single-payer system.' ""That was Sen. Orrin Hatch in 2013, arguing that ObamaCare was designed to fail so that Democrats could use it as an excuse for the government to take over the entire insurance industry.At the time, no respectable health care expert took Hatch — or any other conservative making such conspiratorial claims — seriously.But today, Hatch is starting to look absolutely prescient, even if his timing was off.Consider what is happening right now with ObamaCare. Enrollment is way below expectations. Insurers are putting in for double-digit rate hikes across the country, with some as high as 60%. UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM), and Blue Cross Blue Shield are pulling out of several ObamaCare markets, and most of the nonprofit co-ops created by ObamaCare have gone bust. As a result, the competition that was supposed to make ObamaCare exchanges the health care equivalent of Travelocity is evaporating.And Democrats? They are using these problems to push for a still bigger role for government in providing health insurance.The latest blow to ObamaCare came from Aetna (AET), which had been promising to expand its reach to 20 states, but instead is staying in just four. As a result, at least one county, this one in Arizona, faces the possibility that no insurer will be offering a health plan in the ObamaCare exchange.Even before Aetna's decision, 664 counties — more than a quarter of all counties in the country — had just one insurer in their ObamaCare exchange, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. Given that Aetna is exiting more than 500 counties, that number will only increase.Meanwhile, three entire states — Alaska, Alabama, and Wyoming — are down to one insurer, and there's no contingency if one of those insurers were to pack up and leave.That's not to say all of ObamaCare is falling apart — only the heavily-regulated private sector piece is.The law's Medicaid expansion, in contrast, is doing fabulously well, with enrollment climbing by nearly 15.5 million between the summer of 2013 and January 2016. That's a 27% increase. And that's despite the fact that more than a dozen states refused to expand Medicaid eligibility.So what's Hillary Clinton's answer to the failing private exchanges? Get more people on government insurance through what she calls the ""public option."" This would be a government-run health care plan offered in ObamaCare exchanges across the country.""The public option, Clinton says, ""will strengthen competition and reduce costs.""But wait a minute. The ""public option"" was pushed by liberal Democrats in 2009 when ObamaCare was being built, and it was rejected by centrists in the party because it looked too much like a steppingstone to single payer.As a matter of fact, that was the idea behind the ""public option"" in the first place.As Mark Schmitt explained in the liberal American Prospect, ""The public option was part of a carefully thought out and deliberately funded effort (to convince the single-payer crowd) they could live with the public option as a kind of stealth single-payer."" The idea was that the public option would be able to undercut private plans, driving them all out of the exchanges.But all those centrists Democrats who opposed the public option are gone from the Senate, and if Hillary Clinton gets elected with a more liberal Senate majority, the public option will likely be top of her agenda.With the vast Medicaid expansion, and the public option (as well as Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare), it's not far-fetched to say that soon the only people covered by private insurance will be the diminishing number who get it through work. (ObamaCare was also designed to shrink employer-based health.)So was this all in the grand plan when Democrats passed ObamaCare in 2010?Sen. Harry Reid, all but admitted as much in late 2013, when in an appearance on PBS' ""Nevada Week in Review,"" he said that ""what we've done with ObamaCare is have a step in the right direction, but we're far from having something that's going to work forever."" When asked if that meant a single-payer system, Reid said, ""Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.""Ezra Klein, who at the time was a health care reporter with the Washington Post, explained that the left was pursuing a ""sneaky strategy"" to ""put in place something that over time the natural incentives ... move it to single payer.""Could it be that Hatch, Reid and Klein were all right? It sure seems like it these days.If so, the only way to stop the onward march to single payer would be to repeal ObamaCare and start over with free-market based reforms.Good luck with that if Hillary Clinton wins the election in November.

76,AET,"Aetna (AET) announced late Monday that next year it will exit 11 of the 15 ObamaCare exchanges it currently operates in, citing heavy losses that have driven UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and others out of most markets, posing a major challenge for the Affordable Care Act.Aetna said in a statement:""Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward.""When UnitedHealth announced early this year that it would exit all but a handful of exchanges, many dismissed the move. UnitedHealth, though the largest insurer, had been a late entrant into the individual marketplaces and was quick to complain about unexpectedly high costs.But Humana recently followed suit, planning to leave several states and the vast majority of counties that it had covered. As Aetna noted in Monday's statement, most co-ops have folded due to unexpected costs.Aetna's move means that many more counties will have only one exchange provider, with some having none.Aetna to drop Affordable Care Act plans in Arizona next year. @Aetna's exit means Pinal County, as of now, has no #ACA insurers for 2017.— Ken Alltucker (@kalltucker) August 16, 2016That Aetna, UnitedHealth, Humana and many others have decided they can't make money, even with premiums set to rise by double-digits in many parts of the country, suggests that the law still faces serious challenges.It appears that many patients -- perhaps with the connivance of some providers -- are gaming the system, overloading many insurers with unexpected costs.Medicaid managed care specialists Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) have expanded rapidly in recent years, offering ultra-high deductibles to limit premiums. But even Centene recently reported unexpected exchange losses from its recently acquired Health Net unit.Aetna and Humana may be less willing to stay in the exchanges, now that the Justice Department is trying to block the Aetna-Humana deal, as well as an Anthem (ANTM) deal for Cigna (CI).Related:ObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would
"
77,AET,"Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM) rallied Friday as a Department of Justice lawyer said the U.S. government is open to a settlement over the health insurers' proposed $48 billion merger.The DOJ has filed to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the $37 billion merger of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM).At a pretrial scheduling hearing Friday, the judge overseeing the Cigna-Anthem case said she would not be able to issue a ruling before the end of January. Judge Amy Jackson said the trial would likely start in mid to late November. Anthem has sought a ruling this year, concerned that Cigna may break off merger plans if there's no resolution by year-end.But Justice lawyer Jon Jacobs he was willing to engage in talks. The DOJ likely doesn't want to lose a high-profile antitrust fight. Then again, just because the government says it's willing to talk doesn't mean that the two sides will negotiate and reach a compromise. A settlement would likely involve significant asset sales to rivals.Cigna shares rose 5.3% on the stock market today, moving back above their 50-day moving average and approaching their 200-day line. Anthem rose 1.55%. Aetna edged up 0.3%, while Humana advanced 0.4%.
"
78,AET,"Aetna (AET) on Tuesday said it intended to abandon its 2017 expansion plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and was reviewing future participation in the marketplaces, even as the health insurance giant reported second-quarter results that beat estimates.Just three months ago, Aetna said it planned to continue its ObamaCare business next year as it mulled an expansion to a few additional states.The company's shift makes it the latest health insurer to sour on the exchange marketplaces. Humana (HUM), which Aetna wants to buy, has said it planned to cut its exchange offerings next year. UnitedHealth (UNH) has also announced plans to leave most of its ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), which are also trying to merge, have also warned on higher costs from Affordable Care Act patients.""While we are pleased with our overall results, in light of updated 2016 projections for our individual products and the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we intend to withdraw all of our 2017 public exchange expansion plans and are undertaking a complete evaluation of future participation in our current 15-state footprint,"" Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.Aetna said it expected to lose more than $300 million on its Affordable Care Act plans offered this year.Aetna shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today, while Humana dropped 0.9%, and UnitedHealth dipped 0.2%. Anthem lost 1.6%, and Cigna eased 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Many health care stocks are struggling to find support at their 50-day lines. See IBD's Stock Checkup for more details. Health insurers' ObamaCare offerings have generally made up a small portion of enrollees. Still, Aetna has expressed concerns about the balance of healthy patients in the exchanges' risk pools. UnitedHealth has struggled with its higher-end exchange offerings, which patients are more likely to drop after a short period of time.Centene's (CNC) exchange offerings, targeted toward lower-income patients, had fared better, but its recent acquisition, Health Net, also reported losses on the exchanges.Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare (MOH) said it had agreed to buy some Medicare Advantage businesses from Aetna and Humana in a deal valued at roughly $117 million. Molina's purchase is contingent on the resolution of the Justice Department's lawsuit to block Aetna's combination with Humana.The Justice Department last month sued to stop that combination, as well as to halt the merger between Anthem and Cigna, arguing the new companies would be too big and limit competition.Aetna's second-quarter earnings per share rose 8% to $2.21, topping views for $2.12. Operating revenue rose 5% to $15.9 billion, surpassing estimates for $15.69 billion.The company's medical benefit ratio, or the percentage of premium revenue spent on health services, rose to 82.4%, as ObamaCare-related outlays increased.Aetna stuck to its full-year EPS guidance of $7.90-$8.10, vs. consensus for $8.05, but revised higher its expected medical benefit ratio, to 82%-82.5%, in part due to the exchanges.Health insurer WellCare (WCG), meanwhile, increased its full-year earnings per share guidance to $4.95-$5.05 from an earlier forecast of $4.55-$4.70, well above analyst estimates for $4.64. Second-quarter EPS and revenue also beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters, and WellCare's medical benefits ratio fell during the quarter.Shares rallied jumped 4.7% to 111.91, moving above a 110.91 buy point.

"
80,AET,"Cigna (CI) tumbled in the stock market today after becoming the latest health insurer to cite high ObamaCare medical costs. Cigna also issued weak guidance as the company is in limbo with its  troubled merger agreement with Anthem (ANTM), an analyst suggests.Cigna's second-quarter earnings per share fell 22% to $1.98, badly missing views for $2.39. Revenue rose 4% to $9.893 billion, short of expectations for $9.974 billion. The company said its Group Disability and Life Insurance segments weighed on results.The company's medical care ratio, or its expenses as a percentage of money taken in from premiums, rose to 81.7% from 80.2% a year earlier. That reflected higher-than-expected costs from patients via the ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem itself cited high ObamaCare costs in its Q2 earnings report. Centene (CNC), which has been aggressively expanding in the exchanges, reported some hefty ObamaCare losses in its recently acquired Health Net. Humana (HUM) recently announced that it would exit most ObamaCare markets, following a similar decision by UnitedHealth (UNH), due to exchange losses.Insurers' loses and exits are likely to push premiums significantly higher in 2017.Cigna stock closed down 5.2% to 128.96, gapping down below its 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares of Anthem fell 1.2%, Humana rose 0.2%, and Aetna (AET) dipped 0.5%. Centene rallied 0.8% and UnitedHealth added 0.3%.""Cigna's quarter was disappointing, and with the ANTM combination threatened by the government's attempts to block it, we expect the shares to suffer,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a report. ""We wonder how much of the pressure is a result of focus on the merger, since some of the pressure seems to be related to non-core items.""Cigna's results come after the Justice Department last week sued to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the combination of Aetna and Humana.The mergers, the government argued in a statement, ""would increase concentration and harm competition across the country, reducing from five to three the number of large, national health insurers in the nation."" Health insurers have been looking to consolidate to shore up against regulations from the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Like Cigna, Medicaid-focused health insurer Centene also took a hit in the stock market this week. Share prices of industry players have had a wild month due to DOJ action on mergers and struggles in the Affordable Care Act. See how the industry is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.Cigna also said continued higher costs in its Individual Health business  -- ObamaCare exchange-compliant plans -- would cut into its full-year EPS outlook. The company slashed its 2016 earnings per share guidance to $7.75-$8.10 from an earlier forecast of $8.95-$9.35, far below the $9.29 analysts had expected.Other insurers have also struggled with their individual businesses this quarter, Costa noted.Higher costs due to Cigna's response to a recent audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also weighed on the second quarter and the company's full-year outlook. CMS in January suspended Cigna from enrolling new customers to some Medicare plans due to what the agency called ""systemic failures"" in providing services to patients.
"
81,AET,"Centene (CNC) reported blowout second-quarter earnings, but the stock fell sharply after reporting big ObamaCare-related losses for Health Net.The Medicaid-focused health care provider also poured cold water on speculation that it would bid on assets put up for sale to clear the way for mergers, such as those being attempted by Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) or by Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI).Second-quarter earnings per share surged 70% to $1.29, well above views for $1.09, and the company's full-year EPS guidance of $4.20-$4.55 was above forecasts for $4.10. The company's health benefits ratio -- the amount of income paid out for insurance claims -- was 86.6%, better than 89.1% a year earlier.Revenue nearly doubled to $10.987 billion, above estimates for $10.785 billion, largely due to Centene's acquisition of Health Net in March.But Centene had to set a $300 million premium deficiency reserve, mostly due to Health Net's losses in the California and Arizona exchanges. Many other insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana, have also set some reserves.Centene says its overall performance in Affordable Care Act exchanges is strong.Centene shares fell 8.5% to 68.87 in the stock market today, plunging below a 71.63 entry point in a cup-with-handle base. But the stock closed above its 50-day line after tumbling as low as 63.44 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Centene has been the leader in the Medical-Managed Care group, but other health insurer stocks are performing well. To compare Centene's vitals vs. objective criteria and its peers, go to IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth and Humana have announced plans to exit most ObamaCare exchange markets, but Centene has been expanding its reach, pushing up deductibles to woo customers with lower premiums. The insurer has benefited strongly from the law's Medicaid expansion.Meanwhile, the Justice Department last week sued to halt the Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna combinations. Centene and others were reportedly attempting to buy some of the Medicare Advantage plans Aetna might have to sell to help green-light its purchase of Humana.But Centene CEO Michael Neidorff on Tuesday said that the insurer ""has not participated and will not participate in bidding and auctions. So anything that indicates that would have to be considered a rumor.""Aetna fell 0.5% and Anthem 1.7%. Cigna lost 0.1% while Humana rose 0.55%. UnitedHealth edged down 3 cents at 141.70.
"
82,AET,"The Justice Department filed lawsuits Thursday to block the Anthem merger with Cigna (CI), and the Aetna (AET) buy of Humana (HUM), arguing that they would reduce competition.Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in a morning press event, said the health insurance mega-mergers would have hurt consumers.Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and Humana, after modest initial selling, are up on the stock market today. Aetna rose 1.55%, Cigna 5.4% and Anthem 2.6%. Humana jumped 8.3%, though it found resistance at its converging 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors had largely priced in the risk of regulators blocking the deals after months of signals and reports that the DOJ was skeptical.All four insurers responded that they would fight the lawsuits in court. That would put the deals, announced in 2015, in limbo for several months.Aetna said Thursday that the DOJ move was a ""misguided step backwards."" Aetna had been in talks with other insurers, reportedly WellCare Health (WCG) and Centene (CNC), about selling assets to try to win DOJ approval. Aetna has said it would fight in court to keep the deal.Cigna, meanwhile, said it is ""currently evaluating its options"" given that the deal likely would not be approved, if at all, until 2017 at the very earliest.Humana shares rallied so much in part because it raised earnings guidance and said it would exit most of its ObamaCare markets. Humana now expects to earn at least $9.25 a share excluding various items, up from its prior target for at least $8.85  and analyst consensus for $8.87. Humana expects to lose $1.33 a share from individual markets, as it loses money on the ObamaCare exchanges.Humana is slashing its ObamaCare exchange exposure, exiting at least 88% of the counties it currently serves.""The company's 2017 geographic presence for its Individual offerings is expected to cover no more than 156 counties across 11 states, down from 1,351 counties across 19 states in 2016. Humana expects 2017 premiums associated with ACA-compliant offerings in the range of $750 million to $1 billion versus approximately $3.4 billion projected for FY16. The rate review and approval processes with the related states are ongoing.""UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest U.S. insurer, has already announced it will exit all but a handful of states for 2017. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.1% Thursday after hitting a record high on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: None of the four insurers involved is highly rated, and all are relative laggards in the Medical-Managed Care group. Focus on leading stocks in leading groups. See the top health insurers' vitals at IBD Stock Checkup.

83,AET,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend. Papa John's said EPS jumped 30% to 61 cents to top views, and raised guidance for the rest of the year. Also, chicken-themed El Pollo Loco (LOCO) and Wingstop (WING) rallied on their results, while Jack In The Box (JACK) soared on its earnings.Separately, Monster Beverage (MNST) reported weaker-than-expected earnings growth, but topped on revenue forecasts.

84,AET,"Aetna's decision to abandon its ObamaCare expansion plans and rethink its participation altogether came as a surprise to many. It shouldn't have. Everything that's happened now was predicted by the law's critics years ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said that this was supposed to be a break-even year for its ObamaCare business. Instead, the company has already lost $200 million, which it expect that to hit $320 million before the year it out. He said the company was abandoning plans to expand into five other states and is reviewing whether to stay in the 15 states where Aetna (AET) current sells ObamaCare plans.Aetna's announcement follows UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) decision to leave most ObamaCare markets, Humana's (HUM) decision to drop out of some, Blue Cross Blue Shield's announcement that it was quitting the individual market in Minnesota, and the failure of most of the 23 government-created insurance co-ops. And it follows news that insurance companies are putting in for double-digit rate hikes that in some cases top 60%, and news that the Congressional Budget Office has sharply downgraded its long-term enrollment forecast for the exchanges.Who could have envisioned such problems? Not ObamaCare backers. They were endlessly promising that the law would create vibrant, highly competitive markets that would lower the cost of insurance.Critics, however, were spot on. They said that, despite the individual mandate, ObamaCare wouldn't attract enough young and healthy people to keep premiums down.The Heritage Foundation, for example, said that under ObamaCare, ""many under age 35 will opt out of buying insurance altogether, choosing to pay the penalty instead."" That's just what has happened.Critics predicted sharp hikes in premiums and big increases in medical claims. That's what's happened.Critics said people would game the system, waiting until they got sick to buy insurance, then canceling it once the bills were paid, because of the law's ""guaranteed issue"" mandate. That's happening, too. In fact, administration officials are trying to tighten the rules to mitigate this problem.Critics said insurers would abandon ObamaCare amid substantial losses. Anyone want to dispute that this is happening?These dire predictions weren't pulled out of thin air. Several states had already tried ObamaCare-style market reforms in the 1990s, only to see their individual insurance markets collapse. A 2007 report by Milliman Inc. looked at eight states that had adopted the ""guaranteed issue"" and ""community rating"" reforms at the heart of ObamaCare.Like Obama, these states wanted to create insurance markets where no one could be denied coverage, or charged more, just because they were sick. But Milliman found that these regulations resulted in fast-rising premiums, a drop in enrollment in the individual market, and an exodus of health insurers.Sound familiar?By the time ObamaCare came around, most of those states either abandoned or overhauled this regulatory scheme, only to have it reimposed on them.ObamaCare architects figured they could avoid the fate of those state experiments by including the individual mandate and subsidies for lower income families.However, consulting firm Oliver Wyman correctly predicted in 2009 that these wouldn't work, either. ""The subsidies and mandates,"" it concluded, ""are not sufficient to drive high participation of younger, healthier members.""Aetna's Bertolini says that what's needed now to keep ObamaCare functioning are bigger and more generous taxpayer financed insurance subsidies — i.e., bailouts. Democrats say what's needed is a ""public option"" so that consumers in states abandoned by private insurers will be able to get coverage.How about instead policymakers listen to the original ObamaCare critics? For decades, they've been calling for reforms that lift myriad anti-competitive government regulations, as well as fixes to the tax code so that it no longer massively distorts the insurance market.The resulting free market competition in health care would do what it does everywhere it's allowed to function — improve quality while improving affordability. In other words, it would achieve the things ObamaCare promised but miserably failed to deliver.

85,AET,"Top insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said Tuesday its 2017 earnings will benefit as it mostly exits the ObamaCare exchanges, its worst-performing business line.UnitedHealth reported second-quarter earnings of $1.96 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, handily beating analysts' estimates of $1.89. Still, the company just slightly raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.80-$7.95 a share from $7.75-$7.95, roughly in line with consensus estimates for $7.89.The high end of its full-year 2016 earnings guidance held steady because worse-than-expected results in its ObamaCare individual market business called for a conservative outlook, management said in an earnings call.Shares closed up 1.3% to 142.59 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading near an all-time high and finished above buy range.The good news is that as UnitedHealth shrinks its presence in state exchanges, most of its projected $605 million in ObamaCare exchange losses in 2016 will evaporate. That equates to about 35 cents a share, one analyst offered on the earnings call. UnitedHealth plans to have no more than three state exchanges in 2017, down from 34 this year,UnitedHealth upped its exchange-related loss estimate for the year by $200 million, citing higher-than-expected enrollment and the increased prevalence of customers with chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes and hepatitis C.UnitedHealth had 820,000 exchange customers at the end of June, up about 25,000 from the end of March. The higher total was a surprise, given that national enrollment has typically declined as the year progresses. Last year, UnitedHealth said the additional customers who signed up mid-year, after open enrollment had closed, tended to be sicker.Management said on the call that the company does not ""expect any meaningful financial exposure"" from the limited exchange presence next year, though it noted that some fixed costs of participating in the exchanges will remain.IBD's TAKE: With an 88 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99, UnitedHealth ranks second among health insurers, behind only Centene Corp. (CNC). Check out IBD's Stock Checkup on UnitedHealth here.UnitedHealth kept its cards close to its vest when asked about potential acquisitions, as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) mull selling off pieces to attain approval for their respective acquisitions of Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI). But those deals may be in peril, as Bloomberg reported that U.S. government officials are poised to file lawsuits to block both acquisitions.Humana took the worst of it in Tuesday trades, dropping 3.9%. Aetna fell 2.7%, while Cigna lost 2.1%, and Anthem dipped 2.2%.UnitedHealth's revenue surged 28% to $46.5 billion in the quarter, trouncing the $45 billion consensus estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.""Overall, medical cost trends remain well-controlled and consistent with expectations,"" the company said, noting that the only unfavorable development came in its individual ObamaCare-compliant business. The results seem to validate UnitedHealth's decision to pull back from the exchanges.The company's medical-cost ratio, the share of premium revenue paid out for claims, rose 30 basis points to 82%.UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit, saw revenue grow 14% and served 2.1 million more members than in the year-earlier quarter. On a sequential basis, membership grew 320,000.The real growth driver has been the company's Optum division, which saw revenues surge 52%. Within that group, the OptumRx pharmacy services unit boosted revenue to $15.1 billion, up 69%.Management said that they executed about $1 billion in stock buybacks in the first half, but they will slow the pace of such purchases in the second half.

The China-based firm is a popular online destination for auto consumers. Bitauto is extended from a 32.43 handle buy point. The gain from the buy point hit 20% in less than three weeks. Normally, that would trigger the eight-week hold rule, but the rule tends to work the best in the early stages of a new bull market.It's a busy week of economic data with July retail sales data due Tuesday; housing starts for July and the minutes from the most recent Fed meeting are due Wednesday; and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index is due Thursday.RELATED:Amazon Looms Over These 5 Retailers Reporting Earnings: Action PlanJD.com Revenue Soars 44%, But Net Loss More Than Expected VMware Raises Full-Year Outlook; Parent Dell Technologies Surges

90,AET,"Charity: Disasters like the one unfolding in Houston show the worst in Mother Nature, but also show the best of a free society. Even before any government agency could act, volunteers, private businesses and charities from around the country were organizing relief efforts.There has been plenty of attention given to how well the government — particularly the federal government — is responding to the unfolding disaster in Houston. President Trump's tweet praising FEMA's response, for example, was instant news. But while there's no doubt that marshaling government resources in a time of crisis is vital, all this attention on government activities overlooks the far more important and inspiring voluntary efforts across the country.Over the weekend, dozens of people from Louisiana showed up in Houston as part of what's become known as the Cajun Navy. This is an all-volunteer group formed during Hurricane Katrina that has grown in size since.XThe Cajun Navy was part of what's been described as an ""armada of private boats"" that came to Houston to help rescue thousands of people stranded in their homes by Harvey's relentless deluge.Nobody ordered it, or organized it, or coordinated it, or directed it. Nobody's getting paid. But their efforts are a big reason why the death rate from Harvey has been so low.It's just one of many stories emerging from Houston that show how, in times of crisis, Americans come together, on their own, to help each other, save lives, and solve problems. A few examples:There are less obvious ways private companies help. Waffle House, for example, has become an indicator of how bad a weather disaster is, because the restaurant chain is so determined to keep operating in the worst conditions.Rory Carroll, writing for the UK-based Guardian newspaper about the outpouring of voluntary help in response to Harvey, put it this way: ""Here was the America of the ideal: one nation, indivisible. A republic of citizens looking out for each other. No politics or polarization. No fake news or social media bubbles. A crisis all could see, and a response all wanted to be part of.""Amen to that. The nation's moral character isn't measured by the number of federal programs, or how big their budgets are, or how many bureaucrats are involved. It is measured in the willingness of its citizens to rally, organize and respond to a crisis all on their own, freely donating their time and resources, experience and know-how to help strangers in need. Too, often, these private efforts get lost in the relentless focus on what government is or isn't doing.For all the terrible news to come out of Houston, the response from individuals, communities and businesses around the country is a beautiful thing to behold.Of course, not everyone has been inclined to see the good emerging from the Harvey tragedy.Chauncey Devega of the left-wing Salon, for example, could not contain his Trump bashing even for a moment, writing in a truly awful column about how ""many Americans face a massive natural disaster — but the disaster of this failed presidency is even worse.""Salon should send Devega to Houston so he can see what America is really about.RELATED:Hurricane Harvey's Nationalized Insurance Nightmare

99,AET,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

106,AET,"Aetna (AET), which scaled back its ObamaCare exchange presence this year, easily beat second-quarter earnings estimates early Thursday, while Molina Healthcare (MOH) which dove deeper into the individual insurance market, saw its shares tumble after reporting a huge loss.XAetna earned $3.42 per share, up 55% from a year ago. Revenue slipped 3% to $15.5 billion amid its pullback from the ObamaCare exchange business. Analysts expected Aetna to earn $2.35 a share on revenue of $15.39 billion.After the close on Wednesday, Molina reported a loss of $4.10 a share vs. a 58-cent profit a year ago, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. The company said it will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018, but that could rise to 55% if President Trump makes good on his promise to withhold the law's cost-sharing subsidies that make coverage affordable for low-income enrollees.Shares of Aetna rose 2.5% to 158.57 on the stock market today. Molina shares tumbled 5.9% to 62.32 after hitting 59.41 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Aetna have been on a roll since the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base on April 28, often a sign that a stock is poised for a near-term advance.Despite some signs that the exchange markets are stabilizing, Molina's results suggest that problems are still lurking and that certain markets remain troubled.Anthem (ANTM) cited market instability in announcing on Tuesday that it will shrink its presence in California in 2018, leaving about 150,000 customers to look for a new carrier.

Centene is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) said that its exchange results took a turn for the better in the second quarter. Humana now expects to turn an $85 million profit from its individual insurance business this year, vs. earlier guidance of a $45 million loss. Still, the company will fully exit the individual market at the end of the year as it focuses on government programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicare's prescription drug program in the wake of its acquisition by Aetna being blocked by courts.Humana shares, which reported strong Q2 results Wednesday, rose 4.5% that day.

108,AET,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings before Tuesday's market open. Revenue was about in line with analyst forecasts. The health insurer giant also raised full-year guidance. Shares rose a fraction. XEstimates: Earnings per share should rise 21% to $2.38 a share, with revenue climbing 8% to $50.082 billion. That would represent the second quarter of decelerating earnings growth and the smallest revenue gain in 10 quarters.Results: Earnings per share of $2.46 a share, up 25.5% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $50.053 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise.Outlook: UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.Stock: UnitedHealth rose 0.3% to 186.96 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been consolidating since peaking at 188.66 on June 22, closing Monday at 186.35.Why It Matters: UnitedHealth is the first of the major health insurers to report second-quarter earnings, with Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and others due in the coming weeks. (The U.S. government blocked proposed mergers of Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana earlier this year on antitrust grounds.)UnitedHealth has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, with most of the other big insurers also on their way out aside from Medicaid specialists such as Centene (CNC). But it's still a huge player in Medicare and Medicaid.So Senate Republicans's late Monday decision to pull their health care bill could have a significant impact on UnitedHealth and other insurers.RELATED:Dow's Visa, American Express Are In Buy Zones Ahead Of EarningsThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsDow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak
"
109,AET,"After years of subjecting ObamaCare to the harshest criticism, the Senate GOP's struggles to come up with a replacement over the past several weeks have been a revelation: A critical mass of Republican senators seem to be saying that wresting the health care security provided by the law from their constituents is a nonstarter.That leaves Congress with two possible paths forward. The most likely path is a form of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying problems that explain why enrollment was weak even before premiums spiked, and why the law was unpopular before ""mean"" TrumpCare came on the scene.Stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers, is a good idea and an important step. But let's be clear about what that won't achieve: It won't create a robust nongroup insurance market with rules that Americans can broadly support, and that work reasonably well for the finances of healthy and sick, old and young, working class and middle class.To create a robust nongroup insurance market with lower premiums that serves people well will require taking the other potential path forward: transforming the Affordable Care Act, largely by injecting the ingredient that Republicans say the law is most sorely lacking — freedom.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Simply stabilizing the turbulent insurance-exchange markets wouldn't do anything to ameliorate ObamaCare's harshest reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among the law's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles — despite the threat of a individual-mandate penalty.While Americans aren't crying out for the freedom to buy the skimpiest coverage that insurers can dream up, and pretty much everybody would rather have insurance than not — if the price is right — many people would benefit from greater flexibility than the ACA allows, and the entire country would benefit from a bipartisan consensus on health reform that helps those who have fallen through ObamaCare's wide cracks.That is why the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for high-deductible coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual-mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers. Yes, this family would still be subject to very high deductibles, but no greater than under ObamaCare, and they'd have a $2,000 head start on their medical bills, giving them a chance to put aside some savings — not because their tax credits are more generous than under ObamaCare but because they would be more usable.From 100% to 150% of the poverty level (about $12,000-$18,000 for a single), roughly 90% of exchange enrollees sign up for silver coverage. Bronze-level deductibles would be almost too extreme to bother — if not for the mandate penalty — though some percentage don't bother and remain uninsured. So here's a beautiful compromise that would inject some freedom and flexibility — but not too much — into the ACA.ACA cost-sharing subsidies, which are even higher for this income tier, turn silver plans to ultra-low-deductible platinum plans. That option would still be available, but they also could opt to use their cost-sharing subsidy to cover a basic silver-plan premium and deposit the extra amount in a Health Savings Account. What's beautiful about this is that the bar on minimum coverage would rise compared to the ACA, yet people would still have more freedom to pick a plan that works for their finances and their health status.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on whether the flashing-yellow market trend turns green.We also should do something about the steep drop-off in cost-sharing subsidies that acts as a disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level and is an especially big deal for people with significant medical needs. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available to people above 200% of the poverty level and they opt to apply their cost-sharing subsidy to the premium for the lowest-cost plan, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.This is another compromise in which both sides win. Above 200% of the poverty level, ObamaCare's cracks widen in a serious way. The percentage of the uninsured under ObamaCare takes a big jump, and so does take-up of bronze coverage. Easing the cost-sharing subsidy cliff won't only make it more attractive for people to get coverage, albeit higher-deductible coverage, but it will allow people who need comprehensive coverage to get a better policy than they do under ObamaCare, since the bigger cost-sharing subsidy will effectively turn a silver plan to gold.Meanwhile, freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering. Among the reasons that the ObamaCare individual mandate doesn't work very well is that relatively young and healthy people who gamble on going without coverage can reasonably expect to win their bet and end up with a financial gain. ObamaCare encourages this kind of short-term calculation, since only those who get sick pay a price.A more logical approach would eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. Much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, the idea would be to very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance. The key for this to work in the constructive way intended is that subsidies must be sufficient to make coverage affordable, or else people would opt out for legitimate financial reasons and their future cost of coverage would gradually become even less affordable.Even without this more constructive incentive, it's important to give members of the middle class a better deal than they get now. Those who earn too much to receive ObamaCare subsidies — including young adults earning well below the official cut-off at 400% of the poverty level — should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace.A fiscally responsible solution would be to put a floor on tax credits for anyone buying coverage on the individual market equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) who get coverage from an employer wouldn't be touched by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect on those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).The sad reality today is that ObamaCare throws millions of modest-wage, full-time workers under the bus. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers who — along with their spouses — don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if bronze-level workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income, which ObamaCare deems ""affordable"" but clearly isn't. That can amount to five times what people pay on the subsidized exchanges, sometimes even more. That's why perhaps a million other modest-wage earners — solid numbers are hard to come by — opt for ""skinny"" coverage at work that won't pay for hospitalization or surgery but will keep them from having to pay a mandate penalty. This is worth repeating: The skimpy coverage that Democrats hate is exactly the kind of insurance-in-name-only-coverage that a lot of low-wage, full-time workers are settling for under ObamaCare.The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. Getting rid of it is a progressive thing to do — especially if it is done while fixing the individual insurance market.Finally, we should allow states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so while limiting the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, easing the fiscal burden of the expansion on states, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars.The Health Care Security & Freedom Act wouldn't deliver gold-plated insurance to most people, but it is the least we can do. All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that they believe suits them best. While they entail a fiscal cost, we can tackle that while still putting the nation on a sounder fiscal course and strengthening the social safety net.Having a robust nongroup market for insurance that serves people well should be a priority for the nation. The dynamism of our economy will be better served if entrepreneurs and idealists who are willing to step out on a limb don't have to fear that their health insurance support will come crashing down. Demographic changes make it increasingly important for people to have the flexibility to step back from full-time work to help care for an aging parent or a sick child. Amid minimum-wage pressures and health care mandates, ultra-competitive markets and the advance of technology threaten to widen the cracks in our employer-centric insurance system that millions of workers, many with modest wages, are already falling into. And don't forget that we're entering the ninth year of an economic expansion. When the next recession hits, all of these pressures will multiply and millions more people will depend on insurance outside the employer system.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

114,AET,"As investors and Warren Buffett followers ponder what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will do with its swelling, record-high pile of cash, analysts say options include a major acquisition, buying more stocks like Apple (AAPL), doing nothing, or even a first-ever dividend.X The holding company held $109.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter and will grow by some $3 billion more in December thanks to a bet on the burger business years ago. The record cash hoard is more than five times the $20 billion that CEO Buffett likes to keep on hand, and many shareholders want to see Berkshire put the money to greater work.Hopes are high that Berkshire could shake things up with a deal to rival its $37 billion Precision Castparts purchase in 2016 or its $26 billion Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad purchase in 2010, especially since an attempt this year to buy electric utility Oncor fizzled, while investments in a real estate investment trust and a Canadian mortgage lender hardly made a dent in Berkshire's cash.Buffett even acknowledged to Berkshire shareholders in May that it had been a while since he had pressed his ""foot to the floor"" on an acquisition, and rued keeping so much cash just lying around. But he said the question is: ""Are we going to be able to deploy it?""One challenge facing a Berkshire megadeal is stiff competition among U.S. companies looking to grow through acquisitions. Just in the last month, CVS Health (CVS) agreed to buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Disney (DIS) reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) assets for $66 billion. The number of U.S. deals totaled 9,999 through Dec. 26, up 4.5% vs. all of 2016, according to Dealogic. And while deal values have slipped 14% to $1.492 trillion so far this year, they top the yearly average of approximately $1.137 trillion since 1995.Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA, thinks a key deal — or two — is likely. What she described as Berkshire's ""embarrassing"" Oncor loss may have left Buffett with the itch to prove his deal making chops, though she doesn't expect him to buy some hot tech company.""My sense is, valuation aside, there is still definitely an appetite to do deals,"" Seifert told Investor's Business Daily.A famously value-driven, opportunistic investor, Buffett's likely to scout for acquisition candidates in underperforming sectors as well as those that tend to do well late in the economic cycle. So think consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecom, Seifert said, adding that Buffett could also look abroad for acquisitions, especially Europe given the healthy recovery in many economies there.As for individual names that Berkshire could target, FactSet Research suggested Nike (NKE), Cognizant (CTSH), BlackRock (BLK), SAP (SAP) and Public Storage (PSA) among other companies. These companies check off Buffett's main acquisition criteria: sizable businesses, solid returns on equity, stable profits, low debt, able management, well-loved brands and simple business models.But any megadeal may be done with 3G Capital, which has teamed up with Buffett lately, including on the Kraft-Heinz (KHC) merger and the Burger King deal that eventually created Restaurant Brands (QSR).Actually, a splashy new deal is unlikely in the year ahead, said Robert Miles, the author of several books on Buffett. After a long bull market and stocks at record highs, a good deal is hard to find, and Buffett is ""a Walmart (WMT) shopper when it comes to stocks and companies"" — meaning, he looks long and hard at valuations.Miles said the 87-year-old Berkshire chief could bide his time ""until the next calamity in financial markets"" to jump on a megadeal.Meanwhile, the insurance segment remains Berkshire's cash cow and is its most important segment, notwithstanding this year's series of disasters that will force hefty payouts.The insurance operations require keeping a safe cushion for catastrophe claims, but it also produces a float — cash holdings from premiums collected ahead of claims that the company invests.Last year, Berkshire posted a combined $6.6 billion in underwriting profits and investment income tied to its prized and expanding float. So basically, Buffett ""got paid about 6%"" for holding his billions, Miles said. This puts the CEO in an enviable situation.""Buffett doesn't have to be in a hurry to go out and make silly investments,"" he added. ""He is getting paid to wait.""It's Berkshire's portfolio of stock holdings that draws especially intense interest, as Buffett fans try to mimic these investments. In Miles' view, Buffett could hand the cash pile over to Berkshire money managers like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to buy more shares of Apple or smaller-cap equities.When it comes to stocks, Seifert thinks Buffett is more likely to continue to make equity investments in technology and financials.One thing he won't do? Speculate on some investment driving others to a fever pitch. ""He's not going to buy Bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you that,"" Miles said.Morningstar sector strategist Gregory Warren suggests Berkshire should try something new with its growing cash hoard: share repurchases and dividends.But that would mark a change of heart for Buffett. He is famously skeptical of such uses for excess cash, preferring to see it reinvested to grow businesses. But Warren argues that with more than $100 billion on its balance sheet, Berkshire should at least consider ""a large one-time special dividend"" soon.The windfall that will be seen on corporate ledgers after the GOP's tax cuts is expected to result in more repurchases and fatter dividends. And Berkshire stands to gain handsomely from lower taxes too.In September, when Congress was still discussing a 20% rate vs. the 21% that eventually passed, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote that a cut to 20% could add $27 billion to Berkshire's book value by lowering its deferred tax liability and raise its earnings power by about 15%.MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

115,AET,"United Parcel Service (UPS) acquired a pharmacy license in Georgia in a move that could broaden its business into not only shipping but relabeling drugs, CNBC reported.XUPS confirmed the move, saying the license is tied to ""new and potential business engagements"" handled out of its Duluth, Ga., facility.It's not clear how strategically significant the move might be for UPS at a time when the company faces uncertainty as Amazon.com (AMZN), a major customer, tests its own final-mile delivery service, which could be a negative both for shipping rates and volume.Amazon also is mulling an incursion into the retail prescription-drug business, which also could entail a role in shipping drugs, challenging drug wholesalers like Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK).Investors didn't initially interpret the late-day UPS news as a threat to the drug wholesale group. Shares of UPS dipped 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon climbed 1.5%, while McKesson gained 2.1% and Cardinal Health 2.2%.Amazon's footsteps already are prompting potential competitors to react, notably CVS Health (CVS), which is in discussions to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) and has announced plans to roll out next-day delivery in markets across the U.S., with same-day delivery in major markets like New York City.RELATED:Aetna Soars As CVS Health Deal Offer Could Top $70 BillionCVS Same-Day Delivery To Fight Amazon Is Tough Pill To SwallowOPEC, L.A.

116,AET,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business.

118,AET,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation. The buy point is 144.45. The stock ended Thursday's session 2% below the entry.RELATED:Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsIncome Investing: How To Find The Best Dividend Stocks

119,AET,"The Federal Reserve stuck to script on Wednesday, raising its key overnight lending rate and maintaining a projection of three more rate hikes in 2018. Fed policymakers, including chief Janet Yellen, didn't wave red flags over Trump tax cuts being finalized in Congress.X The good news is that Fed policymakers, factoring in imminent tax cuts, boosted their projection of 2018 economic growth to 2.5% from September's 2.1% forecast without increasing inflation estimates. That signals they expect the economy to pick up speed without causing monetary policymakers to hit the brakes.Ahead of the news, shares of Apple (AAPL) and Caterpillar (CAT) helped push the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average into record territory on the stock market today, thanks to Republican momentum toward finalizing tax legislation and a benign inflation report.Stocks got a lift as policymakers kept all signs of hawkish talons out of view, but gains faded heading into the close.The S&P 500 index closed fractionally lower. The Dow industrials rose 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%, off intraday highs after the Fed decision and Yellen's final quarterly press conference.Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw slim losses after core consumer prices came in cooler than expected, rising just 1.7% from a year ago. JPMorgan and Bank of America fell a bit more after the Fed decision, trading down 1.25% and 1.6%.Net interest margins of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and the rest of the banking sector are pinched when the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates narrows, and that's what happens when markets worry that the Fed is being too aggressive in raising rates.After the Fed announcement, 10-year Treasury yields slipped further.Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that while tax cuts are likely to boost demand in the economy, she also expects a lower corporate rate and tax incentives for investment to boost supply and, potentially, productivity, curbing their inflationary impact.Yellen did raise a longer-term concern about tax cuts adding to U.S. public debt, ""taking what is already a significant problem and making it worse."" She added that Congress may have less ""fiscal space"" for stimulus to help lift the economy out of future recessions.Yellen also touched on Bitcoin, noting that it is not a ""stable asset."" Bitcoin futures were already down sharply Wednesday.The Labor Department reported early Wednesday that overall consumer prices rose 2.2% from a year ago in November, as expected, amid higher energy prices. Meanwhile, prices for food consumed at home slipped 0.1% on the month, continuing the weak stretch that began in August as Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its Whole Foods acquisition by slashing some prices.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Historically tame health care price increases also have helped curtail overall inflation.  Prices of medical commodities, such as prescription drugs, rose 0.6% in November, but were still up just 1.8% from a year ago. CVS Health (CVS) said in a November earnings call that pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4% in the third quarter, dragged down by generic-drug introductions. The profit squeeze on both its retail business and prescription benefit management unit, along with the looming threat of competition from Amazon, is behind CVS' acquisition of Aetna (AET).Leading up to Wednesday's Fed policy statement, markets were pricing in just two rate hikes in 2018. In the short term, soft inflation readings and hawkish Fed signals could further flatten the yield curve at a time when the gap between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yield is already close to its narrowest point since shortly before the 2007 recession began.Yellen said yield curve inversion, with short-term rates exceeding long-term rates, might not mean recession this time.Yet there's reason to expect 10-year Treasury yields to rise amid solid growth and tax cuts, as well as simple supply and demand. In October, the Fed began to let its mortgage securities and Treasuries, which were accumulated to aid the recovery from the financial crisis, gradually run off its balance sheet as they mature. In addition, larger deficits thanks to tax cuts should create more issuance.RELATED:House, Senate Reach Tax Deal, Settle On 21% Corporate RateTrump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeJD.com, Alibaba Seen Cruising In China E-Commerce With Amazon OutStocks Mixed, Bitcoin ETF Shatters 2,000 Mark; Can Tesla Break Out?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

120,AET,"Consumer prices rose 0.4% in November and 2.2% from a year ago, as expected, lifted by a rise in energy prices, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday.X The core consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1%, while the annual rate of inflation ticked down to 1.7%.Wall Street expected the core CPI to rise 0.2% on the month and a steady 1.8% from a year ago.After the report, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average futures moved a bit higher on the stock market today, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell.The Federal Reserve is a lock to announce a quarter-point hike to its key overnight lending rate at 2 p.m. ET, sticking with its original plan of three hikes in 2017. Inflation will have to pick up from here for the Fed to continue hiking at its current pace, much less raise rates an accelerated pace in 2018, as some are expecting. The CPI data cast some doubt on that outlook and may encourage the Fed to be patient.Prices for food consumed at home, which fell in August as Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its Whole Foods acquisition by slashing some prices and were flat in September and October, slipped 0.1% amid a new round of price cuts in November.Prices of medical commodities, such as prescription drugs, rose 0.6% on the month and were up 1.8% from a year ago, a historically tame rise that has helped curtail overall inflation. CVS Health (CVS) said in a November earnings call that pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4% in the third quarter, dragged down by generic drug introductions. The profit squeeze on both its retail business and prescription benefit management unit, along with the looming threat of competition from Amazon, is behind CVS' acquisition of Aetna (AET).Apparel prices fell 1.3% in November, the biggest monthly drop since 1998. The 1.6% annual drop was the most in two years.As the Fed meets, the key question is whether policymakers expect the injection of tax stimulus to make the economy run hot enough next year that an additional rate hike will be needed.Policymakers' quarterly projections in September signaled three rate hikes in 2018, when tax-cut prospects looked dubious. But Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms are now predicting four quarter-point rate hikes next year, now that tax cuts are on the verge of passage, and we'll find out on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET if a majority of Fed committee members share that view. Five of 16 policymakers projected four rate hikes next year, so another handful would have to make a hawkish shift to move the needle.Because the GOP has few votes to spare and complications could still arise, Fed policymakers may hold off factoring in the impact of tax cuts.At least in the short term, a signal from the Fed that four hikes are on the way is likely to be negative news for markets, particularly for banks. Net interest margins of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the rest of the banking sector are pinched when the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates narrows, and that's what happens when markets worry that the Fed is being too aggressive in raising rates.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Shares of Bank of America and JPMorgan rose more than 1% on Tuesday amid signs of optimism from the GOP that its tax bill would come to a vote next week.Hawkish Fed signals could further flatten the yield curve at a time when the gap between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield is already close to its narrowest point since shortly before the 2007 recession began.Yet while UBS sees the Fed hiking four times in 2018, the firm doesn't think that outcome is any reason for alarm. To the contrary, it has a bullish view for both the stock market and the economy. The key is that UBS expects the Fed to be done hiking rates at the end of 2018, when the Fed's overnight lending rate would be 2.375%. By comparison, Fed policymakers projected that rates would ultimately rise to 2.7% in September and 2.9% back in June.The thinking is that an acceleration in economic growth courtesy of tax cuts and a favorable global economic backdrop could speed up the Fed's timetable but only a modest pickup in inflation will allow policymakers to stand pat after that.RELATED:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeThese 3 Dow Stocks Have Entered Buy ZonesHome Depot Follows BofA, Mastercard In Announcing Share BuybacksIBD's Investing Action Plan For The Next Trading DayStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

122,AET,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said.

124,AET,"CVS Health (CVS) announced same-day pharmacy delivery in certain metro areas starting next year and in New York starting next month as it girds for an approaching onslaught from Amazon.com (AMZN). Next-day delivery will be available across the country in 2018.Meanwhile, CVS reported slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Monday amid reports that it could finalize a blockbuster deal to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) before the end of the year.Although expanding into health insurance seemed like a radical way for the drugstore operator to protect its turf, same-day and next-day delivery may be even more of a last resort for CVS. That's because giving customers a seamless way to get their medicine without popping into one of about 9,700 stores could deal a blow to nonprescription sales.""CVS would rather not go down this path but needs to,"" noted Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at the Magid research firm. The move is a reflection of its ""level of concern"" about the threat from Amazon.Shares fell 3.5% to 66.80 on the stock market today, hitting their worst levels since February 2014.Aetna shares rose 1 cent Monday to 177. Aetna climbed 2.7% Friday after a Reuters report that CVS could lift its offer price for Aetna to $70 billion and that terms could be announced in December.CVS earnings fell 8.5% to $1.50 a share as revenue grew $3.5% to $46.18 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.49 on sales of $46.17 billion according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales fell 3.2%, slightly better than expectations. Pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4%, depressed by introductions of generic medicines.CVS narrowed its guidance range for full-year earnings to $5.87-$5.91 from $5.83-$5.93, lifting the midpoint by a penny to $5.89. Analysts had expected $5.88 before CVS' 1-cent beat in Q3, according to Zacks Investment Research.CVS management noted that 1,600 locations now provide home delivery, but characterized that volume as ""fairly small."" Asked about the potential cost of a broad expansion in delivery, the company said it had been able to use its scale to negotiate an attractive rate. Many of the details are still apparently being drawn up, as management noted a possibility that delivery might be free to customers with the purchase of front-store merchandise.CVS has been under pressure amid soft front-end store sales and worries about a looming competitive threat from Amazon, which numerous analysts now expect to enter the $300 billion prescription retail market. Amazon would likely buy a prescription benefit management firm or strike a deal with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to navigate the regulated prescription industry, industry observers believe.IBD'S TAKE: There's a new leader atop IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group. See which breakout stock overtook UnitedHealth for the No. 1 ranking based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance.

Antitrust also may be an issue.CVS didn't comment on speculation about the Aetna deal, but instead held out its new deal to provide claims processing and prescription fulfillment for Anthem (ANTM) as its biggest highlight.A CVS-Aetna deal is seen as a challenge to the dominance of UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest insurer and a competitor to CVS' pharmacy benefits manager business via its OptumRx PBM business.But investors so far aren't convinced.

125,AET,"The U.S. economy is about to get an injection of rocket fuel.Many economists have argued that ""this is as good as it gets"" for U.S. economic growth. But President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear and give a further boost to the long, strong stock market rally.X Now in the ninth year of an underwhelming recovery, the economy was long held back by an overhang of debt and speed bumps from China to the oil patch. It's finally hit its stride and seems set to step up its pace in 2018.""We've got a global synchronized boom with low inflation,"" said strategist Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He called it an ideal ""Goldilocks scenario"" for investors, with the economy neither too hot or too cold.If it continues until June 2019, the U.S. economic expansion will break the record 120-month run of the 1991-2001 expansion.With the jobless rate at a 17-year-low 4.1%, seemingly the only worry on the horizon is that a Trump tax fiscal boost now may be too much of a good thing, leading the economy to overheat and the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes.But inflation remains in hiding. Part of the credit goes to Amazon.com (AMZN) for injecting intense price competition into one industry after another. Evermore powerful tech titans like Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google don't need massive investment, or payrolls, to generate enormous profits. Aging demographics, meantime, acts as a restraint on excessive growth.There's even reason to think that the extra firepower from the Trump tax cuts, will reinforce the U.S. economy's strength, rather than jeopardize its growth streak.Global central banks are pulling back on massive monetary stimulus while China aims to wean itself off another burst of debt-induced growth. U.S. business investment and productivity growth have been lackluster. Tax reforms like lower corporate levies would help counter these economic headwinds.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should pay attention to big economic and news events, but don't let them distract you from how markets are behaving. Read The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the major market averages and leading stocks, letting you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Republican tax plans being merged by the House and Senate would, in addition to cutting the corporate tax rate to 20%, let businesses immediately deduct the cost of new investments. The bills would set rules aiming to create a more level playing field for U.S. multinationals. For individuals, tax reform would lower rates, nearly doubling the standard deduction and hiking the child tax credit. That would be offset, especially for high-tax blue states, by fewer deductions.A year ago, Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen seemed to throw cold water on the tax reform plans being hatched by President-elect Trump and the Republican Congress. ""Fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment,"" she said.Now, with the unemployment rate a half-point lower thanks to 2 million new jobs, the Fed will likely weigh in on Wednesday (Dec. 13) to determine what the tax cuts will mean for monetary policy. Policymakers telegraphed three 2018 increases in its key overnight lending rate in their September projections, and it's possible that they will update their projections to hint at four hikes next year.New York Fed President William Dudley, who is stepping down soon, said Dec. 1 that it's ""probably not the best time"" for more fiscal stimulus.Yet Wall Street doesn't seem concerned. Markets still are pricing in just two quarter-point rate increases in 2018, following a near-certain hike on Wednesday.The risk of an overaggressive Fed — the usual suspect in curtailing an economic expansion — can't be dismissed. But policymakers have traveled a fair distance this year in accepting that the Phillips curve — the link between lower unemployment and higher inflation — may no longer be as predictive as they once thought.Policymakers have long argued that inflation would rise as unemployment fell below 4.5%, but the opposite happened this year, even as growth picked up. The core personal consumption expenditures deflator, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, registered just 1.4% in October, down from 1.8% in February. It hasn't hit the central bank's 2% target in five years.Minutes of the Fed's November meeting revealed that most members of the Fed's policymaking committee saw a meaningful chance that low inflation will have staying power: ""Many participants observed, however, that continued low readings on inflation, which had occurred even as the labor market tightened, might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.""In a way, the Trump tax cuts are a bet that low inflation will endure. While no sure thing, Republicans are putting their chips on some powerful trends.This month's megamerger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) is a case in point. Spurred by the threat of Amazon joining the prescription drug business, CVS plans to remake drugstores into low-cost medical-service shops.CVS's plan is in line with the push to move health care to the most cost-efficient setting. Health care inflation, which historically outpaced overall inflation, has become a moderating force. Growing government budget pressures suggest that will persist.Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained in August why the hotel group has more trouble raising prices than it did in past cycles. While home-sharing via disrupters such as Airbnb has some impact, the bigger issue is ""radical transparency in pricing"" thanks to the internet.""With each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel,"" he said.Joachim Fels, managing director of Pimco, cites the rise of superstar tech firms as a key reason why ""super-low natural interest rates are likely here to stay.""Titans led by Facebook, Apple and Google ""make higher profits, save more than they invest and pay out a smaller share of their value-added to labor,"" he wrote in August. Their growing dominance helps explain the seemingly broken link between unemployment and wages.The retirement of baby boomers also is curbing wage growth. Higher-paid workers are exiting in large numbers, replaced by lower-paid, younger hires. Aging demographics go a long way toward explaining the persistence of low interest rates, Fed researchers contend.If Goldilocks sticks around, even as tax cuts juice the economy and corporate profits, the current bull market in stocks may continue to surprise to the upside.Solid earnings gains, fueled by the best global economic growth since 2010, could be supersized by a 20% corporate tax rate. The combination of earnings with ""the perception that this expansion has a lot longer to go"" could lift the S&P 500 to 3150 by the end of 2018, a 20% rise, Yardeni says. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at about 2637  now.His outlook envisions investors bidding stocks to a ""meltup multiple"" of 20 times earnings. S&P 500 earnings should grow 7.2% to $141 a share, from $131.50, he says. That includes $6 per share via the tax cut (assuming the 20% corporate rate kicks in immediately, as in the House bill, instead of delayed to 2019 in the Senate version).Economists at Goldman Sachs and UBS are among those who expect the Fed to signal four rate hikes in 2018, but even that is unlikely to derail their bull market thesis.UBS thinks tax cuts could push the S&P 500 as high as 3300 next year. Its analysts assume the Fed will be done raising rates for this cycle after four hikes in 2018. UBS sees the PCE deflator's annual gain of just 1.75% by the end of next year. That's comfortably below the Fed's 2% target.Goldman equity strategist David Kostin's ""rational exuberance"" outlook comes with a 2018 S&P 500 target of 2850, assuming the 10-year Treasury yield rises to 3%. Stocks could rise further if yields and inflation undershoot, and Kostin doesn't rule out a touch of 1990s-style ""irrational exuberance.""Goldman's alternative scenario has the S&P falling to 2450 in 2018, about 7% below current levels, if expectations for corporate tax cuts came to naught.An economy with a head of steam can surely withstand a moderate stock market downturn. But this long-in-the-tooth economic expansion might look more fragile if Republicans weren't on the verge of a major legislative victory.However, that's not the consensus view. Many, if not most economists, have concerns about the Trump tax cuts. Moody's Analytics calls the GOP tax bill a ""fiscal mistake"" that will likely push the economy into a ""boom-bust cycle"" and cut short the late-stage expansion.Yet Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, told IBD that this is a good time for fiscal stimulus. ECRI's forward-looking indicators point to ""a slowdown that most don't see coming."" Those include rising junk bond yields and softer industrial commodity prices, he says.Already the U.S. has been through three decelerations and reaccelerations during this expansion, Achuthan says. He thinks it's on the cusp of a fourth one, possibly mild.Yet a timely fiscal boost from tax cuts, which could begin to show up in individual paychecks via lower withholding starting in January, ""can bolster confidence, if it's viewed positively,"" Achuthan said.The roots of the most recent global reacceleration started in China in early 2016 when Beijing unleashed $1 trillion in credit, helping to restore calm to world financial markets, alongside the actions of various central banks.Now China's growth is gradually cooling as the government seeks to curb unsustainable credit growth. Meanwhile, the Fed has begun slowly reversing its financial-crisis-driven asset purchases. The eurozone economy has finally gained a little momentum, but the European Central Bank will soon start scaling back its bond buying.These clouds in the economic outlook look a lot less worrisome with an injection of tax stimulus set to hit the world's largest economy.Just how much of a boost the GOP tax cuts will deliver is unclear. Wall Street firms generally have modest expectations. Goldman Sachs predicts 2.6% GDP growth in the U.S. and 4% growth worldwide.Goldman economists expect a 0.3-percentage-point boost to U.S. growth in 2018 and again in 2019 on the assumption that the bulk of the tax cut tilted to corporations and higher earners will be saved, not spent. Even a modest Trump tax-cut boost could have a significant impact on labor markets, boosting wage gains and drawing more people into the workforce.Doubts about the tax reform impact reflect the plan's government debt increase, which could push up bond yields. Economists also are unsure how businesses will respond to lower tax rates.At least until recently, business investment has been among the weaker aspects of the expansion despite healthy corporate profits.Herein lies the real test for the Trump economic revolution's investment focus, says George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen.The ""near-obsessive drive"" to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% ""will very likely attract a significant amount of foreign investment,"" he wrote.After a long investment drought, he thinks that ""supercharging investment might help build clusters of excellence, boosting innovation, wages and eventually tax revenue.""RELATED:Why Innovation Isn't Fueling Growth In Economy, WagesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

"
128,AET,"After railing for years about ObamaCare's affordability problems, Republicans came up with a plan that would make them exponentially worse.""Few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" the Congressional Budget Office said of the Senate TrumpCare bill, either because premiums for comprehensive coverage are out of reach, or deductibles for lower-cost plans amount to an untenable percentage of income  — more than one-third of income for individuals in some cases and potentially much more for families.TrumpCare is so ""mean"" — President Trump's own characterization of the House-passed bill — that relatively moderate GOP governors and senators have rejected it. Yet if TrumpCare is about to be buried and it's possible to start looking for a path forward, let's not forget that there's a reason ObamaCare was unpopular and suffered from weak marketplace enrollment even before TrumpCare came around.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else. That's why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Unfortunately, the two most likely paths forward are forms of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying affordability problems. One approach would focus on stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers — a good idea and an important step, but one that addresses the symptoms, not the underlying problem of affordability. After all, ObamaCare's unpopularity and weak enrollment preceded its premium spikes, so moderating premium increases isn't the answer.A second path, represented by the proposal from Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, wouldn't actually fix anything. It forces states to choose between ObamaCare, with all of its problems, and a less-regulated alternative built around Health Savings Accounts that's guaranteed to undermine Affordable Care Act protections for low-income households and older adults facing high medical costs.So here's a crazy idea: How about Congress actually trying to deliver something that Americans can broadly support, that works for the finances of old and young, working class and middle class, and that will lead to stable insurance markets with lower premiums?There's no good reason to aim lower, and ideology shouldn't stand in the way. In fact, the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality that makes these changes so important — even if the law weren't under political attack and insurance markets weren't experiencing turbulence. Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among ObamaCare's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why hospital stocks rose and one analyst touted UnitedHealth and HCA Healthcare — even as Senate Republicans called for steep Medicaid cuts in a TrumpCare bill estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 22 million. A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating. (By the way, that bronze option would be far worse under the Senate TrumpCare bill, costing roughly $2,000.)The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.We also should do something about the steep drop off in cost-sharing subsidies that serves as a big disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to remain uninsured under ObamaCare, despite the mandate penalty, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.Freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young-adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering. Among the reasons that the ObamaCare individual mandate doesn't work very well is that relatively young and healthy people who gamble on going without coverage can reasonably expect to win their bet and end up with a financial gain. ObamaCare encourages this kind of short-term calculation, since only those who get sick pay a price.A more logical approach would eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. Much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, the idea would be to very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance. The key for this to work in the constructive way intended is that subsidies must be sufficient to make coverage affordable, or else people would opt out for legitimate financial reasons and their future cost of coverage would gradually become even less affordable.Even without this more constructive incentive, it's important to give members of the middle class a better deal than they get now. Those who earn too much to receive ObamaCare subsidies — including young adults earning well below the official cut-off at 400% of the poverty level — should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace.A fiscally responsible solution would be to put a floor on tax credits for anyone buying coverage on the individual market equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) who get coverage from an employer wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect on those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).The sad reality today is that ObamaCare throws millions of modest-wage, full-time workers under the bus. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers who — along with their spouses — don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if bronze-level workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income, which ObamaCare deems ""affordable"" but clearly isn't. That can amount to five times what people pay on the subsidized exchanges, sometimes even more. That's why perhaps a million other modest-wage earners — solid numbers aren't available — opt for ""skinny"" coverage at work that won't pay for hospitalization or surgery but will keep them from having to pay a mandate penalty.The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. Getting rid of it is a progressive thing to do — especially if it is done while fixing the individual insurance market.Finally, we should allow states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so while limiting the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, easing the fiscal burden of the expansion on states, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars.The ideas here wouldn't deliver gold-plated insurance to most people, but they are the least we can do. All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that they believe suits them best. While they entail a fiscal cost, we can tackle that while still putting the nation on a sounder fiscal course and strengthening the social safety net.Having a robust nongroup market for insurance that serves people well should be a priority for the nation. The dynamism of our economy will be better served if entrepreneurs and idealists who are willing to step out on a limb don't have to fear that their health insurance support will come crashing down. Demographic changes make it increasingly important for people to have the flexibility to step back from full-time work to help care for an aging parent or a sick child. Amid minimum-wage pressures and health care mandates, ultra-competitive markets and the advance of technology threaten to widen the cracks in our employer-centric insurance system that millions of workers, many with modest wages, are already falling into. And don't forget that we're entering the ninth year of an economic expansion. When the next recession hits, all of these pressures will multiply and millions more people will depend on insurance outside the employer system.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security
"
129,AET,"The Senate's TrumpCare bill would add 22 million to the ranks of the uninsured, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.""Despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" CBO said, because deductibles for the plans would amount to such a high percentage of total income.CBO said that 15 million fewer people would get Medicaid coverage, while the individual market would shrink by 7 million vs. projections under current law.The analysis by the nonpartisan agency will make it hard for moderate GOP senators to support the bill. Already, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada became the first moderate Republican to come out against the bill on Friday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine also has said that she won't support a bill that would cost tens of millions of people their insurance.After the CBO score, Sen. Collins tweeted that she will vote no on the Senate bill.I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no on mtp. 1/3— Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) June 26, 2017Republican leaders in the Senate also have gotten plenty of pushback from conservatives as they aim for a vote before Congress goes on a weeklong July 4 recess.A quick vote now looks virtually out of the question, and prospects for ultimate passage don't look great. But the Senate has some money to work with, given that its bill was judged to save $321 billion over a decade, which is $202 billion more than what the House version saves.Senate rules require that the bill save at least as much as the House to proceed under reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass.Senate Republicans released an updated version of the bill Monday: People who apply for insurance in the second half of the year after a gap in coverage wouldn't see insurance come into effect until six months after an application. There was no continuous coverage provision in last week's draft.Under ObamaCare, people who go uncovered only have to wait until the following January to get coverage.Anthem (ANTM), the biggest insurer on the ObamaCare exchanges, issued a statement that offered some modest praise of the GOP bill, touting its repeal of a health insurance tax that the industry has lobbied hard to reverse.Meanwhile, Blue Shield of California warned that ""states all across the country would not be able to make up for the dramatic cuts in federal Medicaid funding and would be forced to take people off the program or to reduce benefits.""Shares of Anthem were quiet after hours on the stock market today, as were shares of other insurers like Centene (CNC) and Aetna (AET) as well as those of hospital operators like HCA (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC). But the stocks rallied last week when the bill was released.RELATED:TrumpCare Is Back On Life Support: Nevada Senator Heller Slams Bill TrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse Deal

130,AET,"Anthem (ANTM), the for-profit operator of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, has said it's exiting Ohio's market, and the law's supporters are bracing for the possibility that it will bolt from the other 13 state exchanges, leaving 300-plus counties with no nongroup insurance options.Humana (HUM) and Aetna (AET) have said they'll completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges by year-end. UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's biggest insurer, set the trend by pulling out of 31 states in 2016, leaving minimal exposure. None of this has hurt their stocks, with analysts generally seeing a pullback from the exchanges as positive for earnings. Shares of UnitedHealth, Humana, Aetna and Anthem have all hit record highs in recent weeks, with IBD's Medical-Managed Care group ranked a respectable 46 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.Yet the health insurer with IBD's top Composite Rating, based on earnings and sales growth, margins and share appreciation, is going the other way, diving deeper into ObamaCare. Centene (CNC) said it will add three states exchanges to its network in 2018, while expanding its footprint in six others.The Medicaid-focused insurer said it plans to offer new exchange coverage in Kansas, Missouri and Nevada, all states where it has Medicaid managed care contracts. Centene leverages its Medicaid assets to serve mainly low-income ObamaCare exchange customers as a low-cost carrier. The formula, though it has involved some controversial pricing strategies that have helped shrink the ranks of the insured, has made Centene a rare breed: a company that's actually generated a profit from its exchange business.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street's focus has shifted from the Comey-Trump mud fight to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week, but the biggest near-term development for markets may be Anthem's coming decision on whether to exit ObamaCare, which could upset the White House's legislative plans.On Tuesday, shares of Centene rose 2.05% to 78.06, leading the managed care group. Centene is still in buy range from a 75.67 buy point.Centene said it's now serving 1.2 million exchange members, up a half million from a year ago. Despite the surge in enrollment as other carriers dropped out, the insurer signaled on Tuesday that no red flags have emerged from the expanded pool: ""The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with Centene's experience over the past three years. Ninety percent are eligible for subsidies.""CEO Michael Neidorff acknowledged the ""uncertainty of new health care legislation,"" but said in a statement that Centene ""has demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.""If TrumpCare makes it across the finish line in a form that resembles the House bill, estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 23 million, that would deliver a big hit to Centene's market opportunity. At least as of April, Neidorff was betting that any bill to emerge from the Senate would be kinder and gentler, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""Among other health insurer stocks, Anthem closed up 0.3% while UnitedHealth rose 1% and Aetna 0.6%.Humana advanced 1.65% to 231.86, now slightly extended from a 220.59 entry.RELATED:One Company Could Wreak Havoc On The Trump Agenda This WeekHumana Could Fetch $300 A Share, But Suitors May Surprise You: JPMorganZombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking OutObamaCare's Top Insurer Is Increasing The Uninsured

Wells Fargo analysts said the same thing last week. What's interesting, though, is that Taylor sees a range of potential suitors that could extend beyond the usual managed-care industry suspects.IBD'S TAKE: Humana is ranked No. 8 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance. See which Medicaid-focused insurer is ranked No. 1 at IBD Stock Checkup.Taylor also sees pharmacy-benefit managers and drug stores as potential bidders because of the attractiveness of Humana's leading position in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D markets.That might add CVS Health (CVS), the drugstore and pharmacy-benefit giant to the list of possible buyers.

132,AET,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

133,AET,"Shares of Exact Sciences (EXAS) jumped to a three-week high Wednesday after top medical insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) announced updated coverage guidelines, opening access to Exact's colon-cancer test to an estimated 30 million patients.On the stock market today, Exact stock popped 11.7%, near 36.47. Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro kept his buy rating on Exact stock, but boosted his price target to 40 from 38.Updated coverage guidelines from UnitedHealthcare, a unit of No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth, will allow an estimated 30 million patients to use Exact's Cologuard once every three years. The update will go into effect July 1.The update will increase the total number of lives covered for Cologuard to 227 million, Massaro estimated in a note to clients. He described the UnitedHealthcare decision as a ""major win for Exact."" The decision arrived nearly a year before it was expected.IBD'S TAKE: Exact Sciences stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it lags leader Corcept Therapeutics which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99.

That's at the high end of Exact's guidance for $195 million to $205 million, but below the consensus for $209.8 million prior to UnitedHealth's update.RELATED:Exact Sciences Q4 Sales Beat, Colon-Cancer Test Procedures Double

134,AET,"Health Reform: As Republicans try to figure out how to replace ObamaCare, they are getting viciously attacked by Democrats who claim the GOP plan would take away the law's guarantee to those with pre-existing conditions. But what use is ObamaCare's ""guarantee"" if there aren't any insurance plans at all?This week, Anthem (ANTM) announced that it will drop out of the ObamaCare market in Ohio. Since Anthem was the only insurer offering plans in 20 of the state's counties, this means more than 10,000 people will face the prospect of having no insurance options next year.This news comes on top of Medica's announcement that it might exit Iowa's ObamaCare exchange, after Aetna (AET) and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield decided to pull out. That would leave more than 70,000 Iowans without any insurance options.Anthem, meanwhile, is considering whether to drop out of ObamaCare entirely, which would leave hundreds of thousands more nationwide with zero insurance options.Blue Cross Blue Shield is pulling out of Nebraska, citing $150 million in losses in ObamaCare's first three years, which will leave one insurer in the state. There have been other defections, and will no doubt be more.At the same time, insurance companies that are sticking with ObamaCare are putting in for rate hikes that are shocking even by ObamaCare standards. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York, for example, is asking for a 48.8% increase.In Maine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care wants an average 40% increase. In North Carolina, Blue Cross wants a 23% hike and Cigna a 32%. Oregon's insurers want premium increases of up to 21%. Anthem wants a 38% increase in Virginia and a 34% increase in New Jersey.On and on it goes.The result is that while ObamaCare technically guarantees coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, the reality for many is that the ObamaCare plans will either be far too expensive or not available at all, no matter how sick or healthy people are.So when Democrats talk about Republicans ""taking away"" this guarantee, remember that ObamaCare's guarantee isn't worth the paper it's printed on.This latest round of bad news adds still more urgency to the need to repeal and replace ObamaCare.Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen had it right when he said, ""This is a federally created situation, and we need a federally created solution.""Democrats and their friends in the news media want to blame Republicans for ObamaCare's latest sufferings, saying that it's their talk of repeal that has destabilized these markets.But that, too, is a big lie.As we've noted in this space before, spiraling premiums and insurance company defections have been endemic to ObamaCare since it became law. They are also precisely what ObamaCare's critics predicted would happen when the law was being debated in Congress. What's more, this death spiral is precisely what state governments that experimented with Obamacare-style regulations in the 1990s experienced.As long as ObamaCare remains in place, insurers would be in the same bind today, and making the same decisions — and that ""guarantee"" would be just as worthless — no matter who occupied the White House this year.RELATED:Where Is The Democrats' Plan To Fix ObamaCare?Republicans Are Not The Reason ObamaCare Is FailingThe Economy Needs More Workers; Trump's Budget Cuts Would Produce Them

"
136,AET,"Health Reform: Insurers are starting to announce their ObamaCare premiums for next year and they're at high double-digit rates. For journalists and Democratic activists (is there any difference these days?), this is the direct result of Republicans' threat to repeal ObamaCare. But that's not what insurance companies are telling state regulators.Here's how the Democrats' story goes. After a rough start, ObamaCare was finally on the mend. Those massive rate hikes and insurance defections of last year were a thing of the past, and there was no truth to claims that ObamaCare was in a ""death spiral.""""The market is stabilizing,"" Karen Pollitz of the Kaiser Family Foundation told one news outlet recently. ""I think insurers are getting the hang of it.""But all the talk of repealing and replacing ObamaCare, the story continues, now has insurers rattled. ""The debate has created one thing insurers hate above everything else: uncertainty,"" claims NBC News.Aetna (AET) is pulling out of its remaining ObamaCare markets, Anthem (ANTM) is threatening to do the same. Iowa could have no insurers in the ObamaCare exchange. And now insurers in Connecticut, Maryland and Virginia announced massive rate hikes for next year that top 58%. The average hike in Virginia will be nearly 31%, according to one estimate.Even by ObamaCare standards, the proposed increases were shockingly high. And most likely these three states — which have early deadlines for rate filings — are just a harbinger of more bad ObamaCare news across the country.And, as night follows day, Republicans will be blamed for it all.There's just one problem with this story.It is not true.Last year, insurers announced massive rate hikes, as they did the year before, and the year before that. Yet that was when nobody had a reason to think ObamaCare's future was in doubt. So why, defenders of ObamaCare should be asked, are the double-digit rate hikes this year suddenly the result of ""uncertainty""?More important, however, is the fact that insurers aren't citing this supposed ""uncertainty"" in their rate requests.We dug out the filings that insurance companies have made in Connecticut, Maryland and Virginia.What insurers are saying is that the ObamaCare markets are continuing to deteriorate, as they have for years, with mostly older and sicker people signing up, while the young and healthy avoid ObamaCare's overpriced coverage. The result is a sicker insurance pool that requires higher premiums to cover, which then drives out more young and healthy people, setting off another round of rate hikes.Here's what Anthem said in its Virginia filing to explain why it wants premium hikes averaging 38% there: ""We have continued to experience increased benefit costs for individual ACA-compliant products, and this reality is reflected in our filed rate adjustment.""It goes on to say that ""we are also forecasting an acceleration of the current trend where individuals with greater health care needs are more likely to keep their coverage in a guaranteed issue market with rating constraints and an individual mandate penalty that is far smaller than the cost of coverage for most individuals.""In Connecticut, where Anthem wants a 34% increase, it said that costs in the ObamaCare market have ""continued to outpace premium increases.""To justify its 37% rate hike to Maryland regulators, Cigna said the main drivers are ""underlying claim costs (that) are expected to increase,"" and the fact that the risk pool in Maryland ""was more adverse than assumed in the current rates.""Kaiser told Maryland that its 18% rate hike is ""primarily driven by the claims experience, ... medical inflation, taxes and fees imposed on the issuer.""ConnectiCare said it was basing its 15.2% rate hike on ""increasing medical costs and greater demand for medical services."" It also noted that nothing about the ObamaCare law would change for next year.The CEO of CareFirst told the Washington Post that his company is jacking up premiums 52% in Maryland because ""the pool of beneficiaries is becoming sicker, in part because healthier people are not coming in at the same level we hoped."" He said its proposed rate increase assumed that Congress doesn't change anything about ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies.There's one other factor driving premiums up in 2018 that Democrats and their friends in the media are ignoring. That's the return of the Health Insurance Tax, a $14 billion nondeductible sales tax charged to insurers.Congress suspended the tax for 2017 in hopes that it would keep premium hikes low that year. That didn't work, of course, but now the tax is coming back for 2018, and every insurance filing we examined cites it as an important contributor to their proposed hikes.Notice what's missing here. While some mention regulatory uncertainty, they are not blaming it for the magnitude of the rate hikes they're proposing.The rate filings all assume, for example, that ObamaCare's ""cost reduction subsidies"" are paid in full next year. Trump had threatened at one point not to cover those costs.In fact, in some ways Trump has worked to stabilize the ObamaCare markets, which Anthem notes in its Virginia filing, citing ""helpful regulatory improvements"" as a mitigating factor. Nevertheless, Anthem says, these improvements aren't enough to overcome the fact that costs ""continue to outpace premiums on a large scale.""The inconvenient truth for Democrats is that ObamaCare is failing, and will continue to fail no matter what the GOP does. It is unsustainable and must be replaced. If Democrats wanted to act like mature adults, instead of petty partisans, they'd be as eager to find a replacement for ObamaCare as the GOP is.RELATED:Unlike ObamaCare, The GOP Health Bill Wasn't Built On Lies And False PromisesProof That Those International Health Care Comparisons Are BogusWhy Should Anyone Trust What Dems Say About Health Reform?

Molina has more than 4 million insured members, including about 750,000 on the exchanges.Dr. J. Mario Molina, the dismissed CEO and a son of the company founder, has been a vocal critic of GOP efforts to repeal ObamaCare. He'll remain on the board.Molina Health, scheduled to release earnings after Tuesday's close, preannounced Q1 EPS of 53 cents, below the 57-cent estimate at Zacks Investment Research.Molina shares rose 17.6% to 59.75, soaring as high as 60.98 on the stock market today, the best since mid-February.IBD'S TAKE: The GOP effort to revive TrumpCare hasn't kept health insurance stocks from breaking out into buy zones, helped by some strong earnings reports.Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) shares hit a record high on Tuesday on the strength of its better-than-expected quarterly profits and higher guidance for 2017 results.

On Wednesday, the stock finally cleared its prior high of 173.59 set in June 2015 on the strength of its first-quarter earnings. Before the open, Anthem reported a profit of $4.68 per share, sailing past estimates of $3.86. Revenue rose 10.3% to $22.32 billion, topping estimates of $21.27 billion.Among other insurers, Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) hit an all-time high of 175.10 but closed up 0.2% at 174.38. Aetna (AET), which will report earnings before the open on Tuesday, flirted with a breakout above a cup-with-handle base buy point at 134.76, but pulled back to up 0.1% at 133.99. Humana (HUM), which previewed its earnings results and raised guidance after the close on Monday, also was bumping up against a buy point on Wednesday, rising 0.6% to 219.35.Cigna rose to its highest point since July 2015, but pulled back to a 0.2% decline. Anthem said it expects an appeals court to rule in the very near future about whether the Department of Justice was wrong to block its acquisition of Cigna (CI). Cigna wants out of the deal. Anthem said it will clarify its intentions after the appeals court decision.Centene (CNC), one of the insurers most closely tied to ObamaCare, fell 0.9% after making a run to the crest of a six-month trading range.On Tuesday, Centene reported a profit of $1.12 a share, 7 cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of $11.7 billion surpassed expectations of $11.4 billion.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's bid to deliver the biggest tax cut in history looks likely to deliver a whole lot less. JPMorgan called the plan ""virtually impossible to pass,"" while Wells Fargo said the long-run costs of deficit-funded tax cuts will outweigh short-term benefits.Centene CEO told analysts not to overreact to headlines about ObamaCare repeal, noting that the GOP's American Health Care Act replacement still divides conservatives and moderates and has yet to make it out of the House. CEO Michael Neidorff noted that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""However, some key House Republican groups backed the latest repeal-and-replace legislation, suggesting at least some momentum.The GOP plan was estimated to cut 14 million people from Medicaid and reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million overall, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Shares of Centene and Molina Healthcare (MOH) have moved higher since the plan backed by President Trump as ""wonderful"" first appeared dead on March 24.Molina Health fell 1.2%.An agreement among House Republicans to let states opt out of ObamaCare's rules requiring insurers charge all comers a single rate regardless of health status (though with adjustments for age) appears to have shored up the support of conservatives. Yet even if the legislation can survive the House, it appears unlikely to satisfy moderate GOP senators in Medicaid states.Anthem said it saw its insured membership grow by 1.2 million from a year ago, led by a 507,000 gain in Medicaid membership. The company, which sells Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said it is evaluating its plans for the ObamaCare exchange for 2018 and will make an announcement no later than July.Centene said its ObamaCare exchange membership soared by a half million to 1.2 million, which was more than expected. While the first quarter didn't reveal any negative trends to worry about among new customers, Centene management said the current quarter would give it a better idea about cost trends among its own customers and those of rivals. Both are important, since ObamaCare provides for risk-adjustment payments to those with a sicker patient pool from those with relatively lower-cost customers.Humana preannounced earnings of $2.75 a share, up from $1.98 a year ago and estimates of $2.49. The insurer, which has already said it will fully exit from the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018, said that all businesses performed well in the quarter and ""early indicators are positive relative to management's initial expectations around medical utilization.""RELATED:Dow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsTrumpCare Is Back: Dow Inches Ahead As Pivot To Tax Cuts Is Put On HoldTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

140,AET,"Health Reform: ObamaCare backers are grinning at a new survey that shows the law is more popular than ever. But this is likely to be the calm before the storm.A Gallup survey out this week finds that ObamaCare has never been more popular, with 55% saying they approve of the law. That, as Gallup notes, ""is the first time a majority of Americans have approved of the health care law."" The big change comes from independents, who've largely shifted into the ""approve"" column.Gallup's findings come on the heels of the April IBD/TIPP poll, which finds that just under half (48%) of those following the story closely believe ObamaCare is unsustainable and will collapse if left alone. And a plurality (43%) say they'd be less likely to support candidates who vote to repeal ObamaCare, while only 30% say they'd be more likely to support such candidates.There's no doubt that at least some of this newfound ObamaCare love is the result of the drumbeat of biased news coverage touting its many supposed benefits, while attacking the House replacement plan.But even as the public grows to like ObamaCare more, it is hurtling toward disaster. Last year's massive hikes in premiums and insurance defections are turning out to be just a prelude for what's in store this year.Humana (HUM) got the ball rolling in February when it announced plans to exit all the ObamaCare exchanges next year. Humana had already pulled out of most states last year after getting hit with massive losses.Humana's exit will leave the 40,000 people in the Knoxville, Tenn., area with no ObamaCare insurer.Then last week, news came out that Anthem (ANTM) might leave most of the exchanges after losing $374 million on its ObamaCare business last year.Anthem covers 800,000 people in 14 states, largely through its Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates, and is the only insurer offering ObamaCare exchange plans in almost 300 counties. So if Anthem makes good on this threat, hundreds of thousands of people in Kentucky, Colorado, Missouri and Ohio could also end up with no ObamaCare insurers.(These folks will still be able to buy individual health insurance policies outside the ObamaCare exchanges, but that means they won't be eligible for any of ObamaCare's subsidies.)ObamaCare is teetering on collapse in other parts of the country where the Humana, Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth Group and others already dropped out, leaving just one insurer behind.The news site Axios did an analysis showing that ObamaCare enrollees in Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia could find themselves out of choices if insurers like Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI) and Highmark decided to drop out.None of this, mind you, has anything to do with the GOP threat to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The ObamaCare death spiral was well underway long before President Trump was elected.The problem is that the Republicans aren't telling people why ObamaCare is failing, and are instead proposing to keep the very ObamaCare regulations that are causing the collapse in the first place — namely, the law's unworkable protections for those with pre-existing conditions.This nice-sounding reform has failed everywhere it's been tried, with ObamaCare being only the latest example. (IBD recently provided a detailed explanation of why ""guaranteed issue"" keeps failing.)The initial House GOP bill retained ObamaCare's ""guaranteed issue"" rule, and any attempt by conservatives to water it down is being met with stiff resistance from liberal Republicans who have made it clear that they want to keep ObamaCare almost entirely intact.Public support for ObamaCare might tumble again later this year in the face of more market defections and a new round of shocks about premium rates. But that won't matter much if the GOP can't explain to the public why it's happening or offer a real alternative.RELATED:Republicans Cave On ObamaCareObamaCare And The Myth Of Democratic ModeratesRepealing The ObamaCare Train Wreck Has Become A Train Wreck2 Words That Spell Doom For The GOP's ObamaCare Replacement Plan

141,AET,"Anthem's (ANTM) reported plan to withdraw from many of the ObamaCare markets where it does business is the clearest sign that the exchanges face a near-term crisis.Such a move by Anthem, which was the only insurer that offered any semblance of support for RyanCare, may raise suspicion that its real motive is to curry favor with the Trump administration to salvage its merger with Cigna (CI).Yet even before Thursday's news about the for-profit operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, there was plenty of reason to expect a white-knuckled, high-stakes showdown over ObamaCare's future this summer between Democrats and the Trump administration. Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) have already withdrawn from most ObamaCare exchanges, with Humana (HUM) planning on a full exit for 2018.Shares of Anthem fell 1 on the stock market today. UnitedHealth, Cigna and Humana edged lower while Aetna rose 0.5%.The official exchange sign-up data for the 2017 open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31 tell part of the story. The exchange population this year is smaller and tilts older than it did last year, both bad signs for the overall health of the risk pool and 2018 premiums.As the number of people signing up for exchange coverage unexpectedly fell by 463,000, or 4%, from 2016, the number of young adults (18 to 34) shrank by 230,000, while enrollees 55-and-up rose by about 19,000, an IBD analysis finds.IBD'S TAKE: ObamaCare repeal was supposedly the big holdup for the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, but now that he's moved on, the White House is seemingly at a loss for how to proceed on tax cuts.What happens in the ObamaCare-compliant off-exchange market is almost as important as what happens on the exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office says there are about 8 million individuals with unsubsidized off-exchange coverage, and most of those are lumped in the same risk pool as those why buy on the exchange. (Those who have grandfathered policies or buy from carriers that don't offer exchange policies are in a separate pool.)Even before President Trump's election created uncertainty about the future of the exchanges and individual mandate penalty, the off-exchange market was set to take a hit in 2017 as premiums for the lowest-cost bronze plans in major HealthCare.gov markets spiked by 28%. An informal survey of some carriers by health insurance consultant Robert Laszewski finds that insurers have seen their off-exchange enrollment fall by 15% to 35% this year.In one important respect, President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan seem misguided when they say that the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. The average after-subsidy premium owed by people who qualified for tax credits and signed up via HealthCare.gov in 2017 was $106 per month, exactly the same as in 2016. ObamaCare mostly shields subsidy-eligible individuals from rising premiums, though the government portion of premiums jumped 32% to $383 per month.The Congressional Budget Office, Standard & Poor's and other outside analysts have been saying they expect the exchanges to stabilize after a big, one-time jump in premiums this year. Yet those predictions look increasingly unrealistic. The combination of a somewhat smaller, older exchange membership, shrinking off-exchange group and added pressure from Trump administration policies has created a potentially explosive situation and enormous risk for insurers.Besides pulling the plug on advertising to encourage people to enroll in late January and using his bully pulpit to criticize ObamaCare at every turn, Trump has taken one action that fundamentally undermines the operation of the exchanges.As reported by Reason's Peter Suderman in February, the IRS acted on Trump's executive order to ease compliance with ObamaCare regulations by undoing its rule to reject tax forms on which individuals fail to declare whether they had insurance coverage during the prior year.The Obama administration had put in place that rule to begin in the current tax-filing season, believing that more aggressive enforcement of the mandate could give a boost to weaker-than-expected enrollment.Now that lax enforcement has been embraced by the Trump administration and publicized by the news media, the big risk for insurers is that ObamaCare will come to resemble the failed markets in states that passed rules requiring insurers to offer the same price to the sick and healthy but didn't have a mandate to compel people to get coverage.Insurers likely already have felt some impact from lax enforcement of the mandate as customers who signed up for coverage opted not to pay their premiums.There's little question that the exchanges were in need of shoring up, regardless of who was elected, but now the situation has become more dire. The Kaiser Family Foundation's Cynthia Cox noted that there are 200 counties — where Anthem is the only insurer — that could be left without an exchange option if it exits.The big fight that seems to be just around the corner is over what happens in markets where no insurers participate. Republicans are now pushing a bill that would let people in such markets use their subsidies to buy coverage that doesn't comply with ObamaCare rules. That's a nonstarter for Democrats, who fear such a fallback would give insurers reason to bail from markets to play by more profit-friendly rules.Most Democrats will likely want to lift income restrictions on Medicaid in such markets or offer some kind of related public option, which Republicans will surely fight. A third potential solution, following Alaska's example, would have states try to entice an insurer to participate by extending reinsurance that covers a big portion of expenses for the costliest plan members. Alaska did that by passing costs onto other health plans, which is a hard pill for states to swallow. It's probably a good time for someone to come up with a Plan D.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare's Individual Mandate Works Like A Payday Loan
"
142,AET,"If there's one thing that Republicans agree on about health insurance, it's that the federal government shouldn't tell people what kind of insurance they can buy. The seemingly ironclad GOP principle is that people should be able to buy the kind of coverage they want.So one of the most curious aspects of House Speaker Paul Ryan's new American Health Care Act is that it limits ""eligible health insurance"" to plans that provide ObamaCare's list of essential benefits. It is even more curious because, as Washington and Lee School of Law Professor Timothy Jost notes in his Health Affairs write-up, the original leaked version of the House plan eliminated federal benefit requirements.Here's the puzzle: If House GOP leaders are trying to keep conservatives on board with their ObamaCare repeal plan, why would Ryan add back this provision that would only appeal to Democrats?IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.One possible reason for the change is that the Congressional Budget Office has said that it won't count anything but major medical coverage in figuring how many people are insured under an ObamaCare replacement. That means that lifting restrictions on what kind of insurance is acceptable might make insurance coverage losses under Ryan's plan look worse. It's possible that Ryan made the change, reinstating essential benefits, to get a better score from the CBO on the plan's coverage impact.The other possibility has to do with budget scoring. The decision to preserve ObamaCare's coverage restrictions may go a very long way in lowering the cost of providing subsidies under the American Health Care Act. That's because, realistically, the only way that most low-income shoppers would be able to use their much smaller tax subsidy under the GOP plan would be to buy low-value insurance that isn't available under ObamaCare and won't protect them from a real health emergency.Already, there are an estimated 6 million uninsured who are leaving their ObamaCare subsidies on the table. Despite the risk of paying an individual fine for going without coverage, many people have spurned bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,150 deductibles, contributing to a spike in premiums and leading insurers including Humana (HUM), Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) to exit most of their exchange markets.Standard & Poor's estimates that Ryan's new health plan will increase the ranks of the uninsured by 6 million to 10 million. On the low end, including the 6 million subsidy-eligible uninsured under ObamaCare, Ryan's subsidies might go unclaimed by 12 million people. With subsidies ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year, taking the midpoint as a rough average, that's $36 billion in unused subsidies each year.""Decreasing tax credits for low-income people without changing benefit requirements will lead to a substantial reduction in enrollment and takeup of the subsidies,"" said Larry Levitt, health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the Freedom Caucus of conservative lawmakers, told the Washington Post that Ryan's replacement for ObamaCare amounted to ""subsidies for unaffordable health care, subsidies for unaffordable premiums — not just policies that Republicans had opposed, but policies voters would reject.""If the essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. As the CBO notes, ""low-income people might prefer coverage for preventive services and routine physicians' visits to keep their monthly expenses low, even if such a policy did not cover more costly services such as hospital care."" In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they couldn't afford to buy very much.That's exactly what Ryan outlined in his Better Way policy paper last summer: ""The new fixed credit would be large enough to purchase the typical pre-Obamacare health insurance plan."" And if people choose to buy insurance that costs even less than their credit, presumably even the barest bones insurance imaginable, ""the difference would be deposited into an HSA-like account.""That latter feature — being allowed to keep tax credits in excess of premiums — is part of Ryan's new bill, but that won't do anything to help low-income people who won't be able to afford any insurance on offer.Ryan's age-based tax credits — a sharp departure from ObamaCare's design that provides the most help to lower-income and older adults — would replace a modified system of subsidies starting in 2020. Because legislation's budget impact is scored over a decade, the new subsidies would be in force for seven of those years during which uninsured Americans could leave roughly $250 billion on the table. That's more than 40% of the cost of the $600 billion in tax cuts that Ryan's bill would provide.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecurityThe House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade
"
143,AET,"President Trump in a Tuesday tweet embraced the new House plan to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare as his own.In doing so, Trump has launched what is likely to be a tumultuous phase of his presidency that threatens to sidetrack the rest of his economic agenda.""Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster — is imploding fast!""While Trump may overstate just how fragile the ObamaCare exchanges are, there's little question that the GOP has to act fast to avoid an exodus by insurers waiting for clarity about the rules for 2018 ahead of a June deadline to set premiums. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Trump promised throughout his campaign that he would ""take care of everybody."" Speaking before Congress last week, he vowed that his plan would ""bring cost way down and provide far better care.""""Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.""Yet the gap between those promises and the American Health Care Act legislation unveiled by House Republicans on Monday appears to be massive. A better read on the consequences of the bill will be available when the Congressional Budget Office weighs in, but analysts on the center-left and right are estimating that TrumpCare would reduce the ranks of the insured by 15 million to 20 million.The coverage losses would result from dramatically shrinking the subsidies available for older adults and lower-income Americans to buy coverage, phasing out ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and repealing ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates.So far, the Republican plan has managed to unite the left, center and right in opposition, though for disparate reasons.Some people who don't get a very good deal from the exchanges today would be better off under TrumpCare, which replaces ObamaCare's income-based subsidies with tax credits that vary only based on age. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a 27-year-old earning $40,000 would get a $100 subsidy from ObamaCare but a $2,000 subsidy from TrumpCare in 2020.Young adults with moderate incomes, many of whom have shunned ObamaCare plans despite the individual mandate penalty, also would benefit from the GOP's lifting of restrictions on how much insurers can charge older adults. Now, insurers on the exchange can only charge a 64-year-old three times as much as a 21-year-old, but Republicans would lift that restriction, raising premiums for older adults and lowering them for young adults.Some in the middle class who don't get any subsidies would be better off too. A 40-year-old earning $75,000 would get nothing from ObamaCare, but a $3,000 subsidy from TrumpCare.Yet the gains in coverage for those who get a better deal would likely be swamped by coverage losses, a range of analysts across the ideological spectrum have concluded. One reason is the replacement, with a relatively minor late-enrollment penalty, of ObamaCare's penalty for not buying coverage. People who let their coverage lapse would have to pay insurers a one-time penalty equal to 30% of annual premiums in the year they renew coverage, even if they go without coverage for a decade or more.Another reason for the expected rise in the uninsured is that many people might not be able to afford to take advantage of the subsidies under TrumpCare. Here's why, using the stark example of a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level, or about $25,500 in 2020:For this older couple, a silver-level ObamaCare plan would cost roughly $1,150, with maximum out-of-pocket costs likely limited to about $2,000 to $3,000, an IBD analysis finds. Under TrumpCare, the same plan would likely cost the couple between $15,000 and $20,000 in premiums, after subsidies. The increase reflects much smaller subsidies and a roughly 16% increase in premiums due to TrumpCare's age-rating change. The wide range also reflects uncertainty over how states would deploy the extra ""stability"" funds in the Republican plan, with the low end of the range assuming that the entire sum would go to help low-income insurance shoppers attain more comprehensive coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.One likely red flag for a couple of GOP senators is that TrumpCare's subsidies don't vary according to geography, even though health insurance costs can vary widely by state and county. For example, the lowest-cost ObamaCare bronze premium this year averages $272 per month in the biggest metropolitan area of each state using the HealthCare.gov platform. But the lowest bronze plan in Alaska costs $626 before subsidies, while the cheapest plan in West Virginia costs $332.Not surprisingly, perhaps, Republicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia are seen as among the most likely to vote against repeal. Both senators, along with Rob Portman of Ohio and Cory Gardner of Colorado, warned in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday that they won't support a bill that ""does not meet the test of stability for individuals currently enrolled"" in ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.It's not clear if they'll be won over by the House provision that would grandfather people who enroll in the Medicaid expansion through the end of 2019. After that, the GOP would stop covering 90% of costs for new enrollees, so states would likely change the parameters of the program, shifting newcomers to the federal tax credits under TrumpCare.One negative fallout of that grandfathering provision is that people may be even more determined to hang onto their Medicaid coverage, or else they'll face an extremely hard time affording coverage in the individual market. Ironically, these are the kind of work disincentives that have led the GOP to oppose ObamaCare's income-based subsidies in the first place.Legislative prospects would look somewhat better for TrumpCare if it were only centrist Republicans on the fence, but conservative groups are coming out in opposition too, such the Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth. The Club for Growth warned on Tuesday, ""If this warmed-over substitute for government-run health care remains unchanged, the Club for Growth will key vote against it.""RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsTrump, GOP Will Create New ObamaCare Winners, LosersThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade   
"
144,AET,"Social Security's day of reckoning is a dozen years away, according to the Congressional Budget Office. ObamaCare may be headed for crisis as early as next year. Here's how to save both, offering more affordable coverage and preserving the old-age safety net — without breaking the Treasury.ObamaCare was sick and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election, but with the Trump administration unwilling to promote enrollment or step up enforcement of the individual mandate, the exchanges could be headed for a crisis.Humana (HUM) said on Feb. 14 that it's making a complete exit. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) already have one foot out the door, while Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around in 2018.Democrats may be tempted to stand aside, watch ObamaCare unravel and let the GOP reap the whirlwind, but they have an obligation to play a constructive role. Even before this year's enrollment decline, the pool of customers was too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as a result.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly the law's big beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.Yet here's the truth about Republican repeal-and-replace plans: They all give a better deal to young, healthy and middle-class insurance shoppers by making health care unaffordable for older, higher-cost and low-income individuals. For a 64-year-old, low-income couple, the same plan that costs $1,000 under ObamaCare could cost $18,000 under new Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's Empowering Patients First plan.So this is the key question: Can't we come up with a more uplifting approach that doesn't treat health insurance markets as a zero-sum game, creating millions of losers as well as millions of winners?Yes, definitely. If enough Democrats are willing to be honest about ObamaCare's flaws and the extent of our budget challenges, and enough Republicans are willing to acknowledge that taking away ObamaCare's protections for millions who depend on it is not a good idea, it just might be possible to change the debate and accomplish some big things.Politics aside, there are two big hurdles standing in the way. The first is a hurdle of understanding. No one on Capitol Hill seems to realize that the best step forward for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, is to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.The second hurdle is one of resources. Replacing ObamaCare with something that works much better and gives people more freedom to choose options that work for their finances won't be free. Yet, realistically, any bipartisan plan put forward can't raise tax rates and must deliver big budget savings. Some of those savings can be found within the health care system, as explained below.There is also very good reason to marry Social Security reform with a health insurance fix that keeps care affordable for people under 65. RomneyCare, the model for ObamaCare, reduced work among adults age 55 to 64, the Boston College Center for Retirement Research found.Health insurance subsidies that rise as income falls encourage people to claim Social Security benefits early, replacing a bigger paycheck. Spending a bit less on early retirement — without pulling away the floor of support for those who really need it — would give people a nudge to work longer. That would lead to better personal financial outcomes, limiting penalties people will face for retiring early — a lifelong 30% hit to annual benefits for those who claim Social Security at age 62 — and averting the need to cut Social Security benefits in very old age to restore the program to solvency.The plan here would close more than half of Social Security's financing hole without raising the retirement age or cutting any benefits for the very old, while creating a stronger minimum Social Security benefit for modest-wage workers to keep them from falling into poverty late in life — something policymakers on the left and right have wanted to do forever.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's been good for gold prices.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to be uninsured, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats. These steps could make premiums essentially free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers — and their spouses — who don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income. They shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Further, members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace. A logical solution would give a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect for those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and most will get extra cash on top, there's probably no need to threaten them.Above 250% of the poverty level, post-ObamaCare rules should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach, much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, would very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if these separate high-risk pools are supposed to offer good and affordable coverage (as they should), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's just one of the reasons why it makes more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal.That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups a portion of insurer expenses for the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government to foot the bill). Republican governors should be in favor of federal reinsurance, or else states with an older population or less-healthy pool of customers could end up bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of repairing and replacing ObamaCare. Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. It's a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.Allowing states to expand Medicaid but limit the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars, also could be a popular option among Republican governors.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best.So how would Social Security change? One provision called Old-Age Risk-Sharing, introduced in the 2010 book ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" reduces benefits in the first year of retirement, with progressively smaller cuts for lower earners, and the cuts steadily diminish over 20 years, falling to zero at age 82 for someone who claims benefits at 62.As longevity rises — though in a very unequal fashion across income groups — and people face growing risk of outliving their savings, it's sensible to carefully scale back support for early retirement. Yet because many people don't have a choice about when they stop working, it's critical to include a fail-safe function, and in this case there will be three:No. 3 involves another idea introduced in ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" called a progressive saving offset. Everyone would be required to save an additional 1.5% of income per year, with the funds going into a personal account rather than to the Treasury. For low earners, two-thirds of this savings will go to an early-retirement account, with the other one-third deposited in an account that will eventually fund 5% of annual benefits, offsetting the amount by which benefits are reduced. For average earners, one-third of the 1.5% savings would go into an early-retirement account, with the other two-thirds eventually used to fund 10% of annual benefits.Here's why this mandated savings shouldn't be considered a tax hike. First, people are going to need more retirement income than Social Security will be able to afford. People can always choose to save less outside of Social Security or hold riskier investments outside of Social Security to compensate for the extra mandated savings that would likely be invested in Treasuries. Second, this is money people will own. If they die, the account is transferred to their estate. Lastly, the 1.5% of income will be matched by Social Security, though in a notional account (meaning it won't require government borrowing). This will give modest-income workers the chance to leave an inheritance via Social Security — now only possible if they die when their children are still minors — without undercutting income security.RELATED:

145,AET,"Aetna (AET) and CVS Health (CVS) are hurrying to finalize a merger as soon as December as health care players scramble to position themselves for a possible move by Amazon (AZMN) into the pharmaceutical delivery space, according to sources in a Reuters report Friday. CVS could offer more than $70 billion, Reuters reported, sending Aetna shares jumping Friday.XCVS Health is the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator and a major pharmacy benefits manager (PBM). Aetna is a major health insurer.CVS has already agreed to split its consideration for the deal between stock and cash to help reduce Aetna shareholders' tax liabilities. The sources also said the exact price tag will be decided closer to December.Aetna shares jumped 2.7% to 176.98 on the stock market today, after rising as high as 182.95 intraday on the Reuters report. Aetna shares are once again extended out of buy range, with a market capitalization of $58.8 billion.CVS Health fell 0.2% to 69.27, near its lowest levels since early 2014.Shares initially broke out on Oct. 26, surging 11.5% on the initial reports of CVS takeover interest.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The potential deal has gotten mixed reviews. Some analysts say the deal would give the combined company negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers and but others worry that health insurer companies could distance themselves from the pharmacy. Antitrust regulations are also a hurdle.Amazon is reportedly in talks with pharmacy benefit managers as it looks to get approval to enter the pharmaceutical delivery business.RELATED: Aetna Tops Earnings Views, Mum On CVS; WellCare Health SoarsInvestors Stand For Anthem; Stock Hits Buy On Earnings, New DealRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon (AMZN) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis

146,AET,"Aetna (AET) easily topped Wall Street's third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday even as it fell short on revenue. But the health insurer said it won't comment on reports that it is in talks to be acquired by CVS Health (CVS). The drugstore giant and pharmacy benefit manger is mulling a reported $66 billion as tries to position itself for the entry of Amazon.com (AMZN) into the retail prescription business.XMeanwhile, rival health insurer WellCare Health (WCG) soared back into a buy zone on its blowout earnings.Aetna earnings per share rose 18% to $2.45 as revenue fell 5% to $14.99 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $2.08 and revenue of $15.11 billion. Aetna raised its full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $9.75 from the $9.45 to $9.55 range offered in early August and the $9.49 analyst consensus. But given the 27-cent beat in Q3, that implies Q4 EPS roughly in line.WellCare Health earned $4.08 a share, up 150% vs. a year earlier and more than doubled the expected $1.90. Revenue grew 25% to $4.403 billion though that was just below the consensus for $4.411 billion.Aetna shares fell 0.7% to 170.05 on the stock market today, continuing to slip from Thursday's 11.5% spike to 180.70 when news of CVS merger talks hit.WellCare shares jumped 9.1% to 197.67, hitting a record high and retaking a 184.98 buy point.Meanwhile, CVS shares rose 0.1%, but that's after tumbling more than 9% over the prior three sessions to their lowest levels since early 2014 on the buzz that it was offering $66 billion for Aetna.Amazon shares, which surged Friday on better-than-expected earnings, edged higher early, continuing to rally after  surging 13.2% Friday on its blowout Q3 earnings.Aetna highlighted Medicare as the company's primary growth driver, with 23,000 new members added in the quarter and plans to expand its geographic footprint in 2018. Aetna ended the period with 22.2 million insured members.The revenue decline reflected a one-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act health insurer fee that is tacked on to premiums, a pullback from the ObamaCare individual market and Medicaid contract losses.Management said the restoration of the health insurance fee would knock 25 cents off of 2018 EPS.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Friday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Analysts have been somewhat divided over the benefits of a CVS-Aetna deal, with some saying it would provide negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers and others warning that other health plans might distance themselves from CVS. Antitrust also may be an issue.A CVS-Aetna deal is seen as a challenge to the dominance of UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which spearheaded the combination of managed care and prescription benefit management with its 2015 acquisition of Catamaran, now OptumRx. UnitedHealth shares slipped 1.5% on Monday. UnitedHealth is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends.Express Scripts (ESRX), as a stand-alone prescription benefit manager, is seen as increasingly vulnerable and a potential takeover target. Shares of Express Scripts dipped 0.1% after a 1.4% loss Monday.RELATED:CVS Health Looks To Buy Aetna As Amazon Threat Gets RealAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarAnthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

An earnings beat was offset by a sales miss. Shares of Under Armour are down about 50% year-to-date amid deteriorating fundamentals.Longtime Leaderboard holding Alibaba (BABA) was up 0.4% ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open.The stock is just above a 177.10 entry from a rare ascending base pattern. Because of this, it could be a candidate for a call-option trade ahead of earnings.Late Monday, when shares were trading around 181.50, a weekly call option with a 182.50 strike price and Nov. 3 expiration came with a premium of around $5.10. That offered a trade with reasonable downside risk of 2.8%. One contract gives the holder the right to buy, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Alibaba at 182.50 for a cost of $510, excluding commission.Keep in mind that when taking the premium paid into account, Alibaba would have to rally north of 187 for the trade to start making money. If Alibaba falls on earnings, the most that can be lost on the option trade is the amount paid for the contract; in this case, $510.You can learn more about IBD's earnings option strategy here.Shares of Facebook (FB) were up a fraction.

150,AET,"CVS Health (CVS) isn't taking the threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) lying down.XNews that the drugstore chain is reportedly in talks to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for more than $200 per share hit just after reports that Amazon has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states.Aetna shares vaulted 11.5% to close at 178.60 on the stock market today. CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) lost 4.2%, McKesson (MCK) 5.2% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

152,AET,"Major health insurers and hospital groups sold off Friday after the White House confirmed that President Trump will cut off subsidies that make medical bills affordable for low-income beneficiaries.XWhile the timing of his action is uncertain, there is potential for it to unleash chaos in numerous ObamaCare exchange insurance markets and lead to a surge in the uncompensated care provided by hospitals — though there's also a chance such chaos won't materialize.Managed care stocks were broadly lower, though Centene (CNC), which has a leading share of exchange enrollment, closed down 3.2% on the stock market today. after plunging as much as 11%. Anthem and Molina Healthcare, which have both scaled back their exchange participation, lost 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Even insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have fully extricated themselves from the exchange business lost ground, though the closed well off intraday lows. UnitedHealth slipped 0.2%, while Aetna gave up 0.9%.Among hospital groups, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.1%, Community Health Systems (CYH) 4%. HCA Healthcare (HCA) erased losses to close up 0.5%.While there's potential for serious fallout, it's also possible that Trump's move to stop funding ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies, which come on top of premium subsidies for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, will be much ado about nothing.The 2010 Affordable Care Act health law requires that insurers provide the equivalent of platinum-level coverage to the lowest-income tier of beneficiaries paying for silver-level coverage. The government is supposed to make insurers whole for providing that extra level of coverage that can reduce out-of-pocket medical spending to a maximum of $1,000 or less vs. about $7,000 for silver plans. But even if the government doesn't come through, insurers are still on the hook for providing those extra benefits.To get around this threat, which could drive insurers to leave the exchanges, state regulators are allowing them to lump those extra costs onto silver plan premiums. Since subsidies are tied to the cost of silver plans, everyone who qualifies for subsidies would get a much bigger one under this scenario.The problem is that many states didn't take any precautions for the possibility that Trump would end the cost-sharing subsidies, despite his threat to do so. Because rates have already been set for 2018, insurers might be stuck paying for those extra costs, so some might just stop providing ObamaCare marketplace coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The insurer which has made the biggest bet on ObamaCare is ranked No. 1 in the IBD Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales and profit margin trends, as well as stock performance. Find the leaders in each of 197 industry groups at IBD Stock Checkup. There have been bipartisan discussions in Congress about funding the subsidies, which the Obama administration treated like an entitlement, funding them without an appropriation from Congress. A federal judge ruled last year that President Obama violated the power of the purse that the Constitution entrusts to Congress. While that ruling could be appealed, the Trump White House has no desire to and can legitimately say it's abiding by the law.Because the Congressional Budget Office baseline presumes ongoing funding of the cost-sharing subsidies, Congress could renew funding with no impact on the budget. In fact, CBO found that failure to renew funding would increase the federal deficit by $194 billion and boost the ranks of the insured by 1 million. The reason that deficits would go up is that killing the cost-sharing subsidies would lead to a spike in premiums, which would in turn lead to much higher premium subsidies.The late Thursday announcement that Trump will, at some point, end the cost-sharing subsidies came just hours after he signed an executive order that would expand options to buy low-cost, high-deductible insurance outside of the exchanges.While killing the cost-sharing subsidies might not end up hurting insurers, if Congress steps in to fund them or the move is delayed, insurers and health care investors are right to be nervous.Trump's actions send a signal that the White House is determined to undermine ObamaCare in any way possible, including gutting the individual mandate that's meant to get relatively young and healthy people to sign up for coverage.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersHouse GOP Wins ObamaCare Lawsuit: Key Subsidies Illegal McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular TruthsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

154,AET,"U.S. antitrust officials are poised to file lawsuits to block Anthem's (ANTM) takeover of rival health-insurer Cigna (CI) and Aetna's (AET) deal to buy Humana (HUM), according to a person familiar with the matter.Tasked with protecting competition, Justice Department officials are concerned the deals would harm customers by turning the health-insurance industry's five biggest companies into three, according to several people familiar with the situation. The fifth major health insurer is UnitedHealth (UNH), the biggest of the quintet.The final decision could come this week and will be made by the end of the month, one of the people said.Shares of the four insurers were all lower in morning trades. Humana was hit hardest, down 5.5%. Aetna dropped 4.1%, Anthem lost 3.2%, and Cigna gave up 2.4%. UnitedHealth, which is sitting on the sidelines at present and reported earnings Tuesday, sidestepped most of the damage but still was off 0.3%.News of the government's possible thwarting of the deals came a few days after Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell highlighted the importance of competition to insurance markets.Last week, Burwell said competition among insurers can reduce costs that consumers face and improve the quality of their health coverage. Burwell declined to comment on the proposed mergers, but said: ""When there is competition, that creates downward price pressure, and it also creates upward quality pressure.""Burwell went on to say: ""We've always thought and talked about why competition is an important part of the overall picture, and that's not just in the marketplace but overall for the nation in terms of our health care.""

155,AET,"Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) wiped out an initial boost in the stock market today, trading lower before Monday's close amid continued doubts about whether regulators will approve Aetna's $37 billion takeover of Humana.Monday's initial gains in both stocks came after Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Centene (CNC) and Wellcare Health (WCG) have both bid for some Aetna's Medicare Advantage policies, while others are considering snapping up other parts of Aetna. Aetna in recent weeks moved to put up Medicare Advantage assets for sale to stave off antitrust worries surrounding the Humana deal, Reuters reported.But DOJ officials are skeptical that Aetna asset sales will satisfy their concerns, according to a report by MLX, which covers regulatory issuesAetna rose for much of the day, but fell 0.5% to 116.44, closing just above its 50-day. Aetna is currently carving out a handle in a cup-with-handle base begun more than a year ago.Humana also reversed and skidded 2.6% to 154, hitting its lowest levels since February 2015. That followed a 2.6% loss Friday.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) also reversed modestly lower. Regulators also have serious doubts about Anthem's planned Cigna takeover.Humana plunged 9.6% on Thursday, its worst loss in years, while Aetna slid 4% on an MLX report that the Justice Department raised concerns that a potential combination with Aetna would reduce elderly customers' Medicare options. Aetna met with the Justice Department on Friday in attempt to address the agency's concerns.Centene rose 0.9% to 71.60 Monday after briefly topping a 71.63 buy point from a cup-with-handle base that begun last July. Volume was below average.IBD'S TAKE: Centene's below-average move Monday suggests its breakout lacks institutional support. For a top-rated company breaking out in robust volume, check out Ebix. Wellcare Health fell 0.6% to 105.96.Combined, Aetna and Humana provide Medicare Advantage coverage to millions of customers.

156,AET,"Humana (HUM) shares slid nearly 10% Thursday, its worst one-day loss in years, on reports that the Department of Justice is seriously concerned about the planned $37 billion takeover by Aetna (AET).A report in antitrust trade publication MLex also said a meeting had been set up for the Department of Justice and the companies to discussed the proposed merger. The report noted that investigators are mostly concerned about whether the merger could limit consumer choices for Medicare Advantage health plans for seniors. Bloomberg also reported that Aetna will meet with top DOJ officials Friday.Aetna was prepared to sell several billion dollars of assets to meet regulatory requirements for the merger, Bloomberg last week reported. That report, citing sources close to the situation, said that Aetna had identified assets that it believed would reduce overlap between its operations and those of Humana. Humana is a big player in the growing market for Medicare Advantage insurance, making it an appealing target for Aetna. The development comes amid a consolidation wave in the health insurance industry.Cigna (CI) last year reportedly turned down multiple takeover offers before reaching an agreement with Anthem (ANTM). In recent weeks reports have said regulators are skeptical.Humana revenue growth has slowed over the last three quarters from 12% to 9%, 8% and 0% last quarter.Shares closed down 9.6% at 162.74 in the stock market today, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Aetna fell 4%.IBD'S TAKE: Humana's IBD Composite Rating is down to 46, meaning that 54% of all stocks have performed better on key criteria such as earnings and share price performance. See how HUM and AET stack up vs. rivals in IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth (UNH), world's largest health insurer with about $165 billion annual revenue, stands to gain as Aetna-Humana -- and Anthem-Cigna --- negotiations drag out. The merger would create a company that, although still not as large at UnitedHealth, would be a more serious rival.UnitedHealth slid 1.1% after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Anthem fell 2% and Cigna lost 1%.

159,AET,"Federal regulators have expressed concerns about the Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger and could scuttle the $48 billion deal, according to reports. But so far, investors, while taking notice, aren't panicking.The merger would bring the number of health insurance giants in the U.S. down to three -- UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem and Aetna (AET) -- including Aetna's pending acquisition of Humana (HUM).Anthem and Cigna management met with Justice Department officials and representatives of more than a dozen state attorneys general earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources close to the situation.The government regulators expressed concern that the companies wouldn't be able to provide enough concessions to preserve competition in the health insurance sector. The companies outlined plans to make changes they hoped would be sufficient to ease those concerns, the report said.In addition, California's insurance commissioner last week in a letter to the Justice Department expressed doubts about the merger, Bloomberg reported, saying it would seriously hurt competition in the nation's most populous state.If the deal goes through, the merged company would have 40% to 50%-plus market share in California for a multitude of services in many counties. Anthem on May 26 announced that it had received approval from Indiana for the planned purchase, the 10th state to OK the deal.Combining the two insurers would create a company with annual sales of more than $118 billion a year. UnitedHealth has annual sales of about $132 billion.Anthem shares were up 0.3% to 132.72 on the stock market today. It has consolidating for more than eight months with a buy point of 173.69 and was trading below both its 10-week average and its 200-day line Monday. Cigna was down 1.3% to 127.94.Anthem, which operates Blue Shield Blue Shield plans and has annual sales of about $61 billion, proposed the deal nearly 11 months ago, on July 23, 2015.That same month, Aetna agreed to buy Humana for $35 billion. Aetna management said earlier this year that it expects that merger to close by end of 2016.Aetna shares climbed 1% to 122.34. Humana was up 1.5% to 189.90. UnitedHealth shares were up 0.6% to 138.55.
"
160,AET,"Insurers covering more than half the U.S. are seeking average premium hikes of 25% for 2017 for ObamaCare policies sold on and off the public exchanges.Although the requests are preliminary and filings for 20 more states are still due, there's now little doubt that individual market premiums are set for a shockingly large jump next year.An IBD analysis of rate hikes proposed by individual insurers finds a wide divergence, from an average 10.0% hike per customer requested by Centene (CNC) on the low end to the 38.1% increase sought by Humana (HUM). Among other participants, Molina Healthcare (MOH) is seeking an average 10.4% hike, Cigna (CI) 16.5%, Aetna (AET) 19.6%, Anthem (ANTM) 21.3% and UnitedHealth (UNH) 24.9% in the few markets it's not planning to exit.The data, though incomplete, suggest potential for big increases in market share by Centene and Molina, two Medicaid managed care companies that have quickly grown an individual market presence in the ObamaCare era, even as heavyweights like UnitedHealth and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have been swamped ObamaCare exchange losses.Among states, Tennessee tops the list with a weighted average 56.4% premium hike requested by insurers. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee is asking for a 62% hike after requesting -- and receiving approval for -- a 36% rate hike in 2016.So far, insurers in 9 additional states are seeking average hikes of at least 25%, including Arizona (53.1%), Oklahoma (51.0%), Kansas (35.3%), Texas (35.1%), Nebraska (35.0%), Iowa (32.0%), Delaware (30.5%), Oregon (27.5%) and Louisiana (26.8%), according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Big premium hikes threaten to stall growth of the ObamaCare exchanges by driving away healthy members, particularly those who don't get subsidies, making the relatively costly customer base even more so. Indeed, some insurers are pricing such adverse selection into their 2017 rates.Providence Health of Oregon, which saw a threefold jump in customers in 2016, said 5 percentage points of its proposed 29.6% hike reflects its expectation that 2017 customers will be in poorer average health. That’s in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market -- especially relatively healthy customers.The proposed increases also reflect the trend growth rate of medical costs as well as the end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program that has helped offset the cost of insurers' most expensive customers. Yet 2017 premium hikes might be a couple of percentage points higher if not for a deal in Congress that shelved ObamaCare's health insurance tax for 2017, saving about $12 billion for the insurance industry, which passes such costs directly to customers.Last year, insurers requested premium hikes averaging about 14% for 2016. The Obama administration subsequently said that the actual rate hike experienced by customers, including millions of people who shopped for a cheaper plan, was only about 8%. IBD explained why that analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services understated actual rate hikes, primarily because people were buying less coverage for their money.The costlier reality experienced by ObamaCare customers is underscored by a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey. As Brian Blase, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center noted, ""Individuals who switched plans are twice as likely to feel less financially protected with their new plan than more financially protected.""By Monday's close in the stock market today, Centene ended trading off 0.9% to 67.30. Humana fell 1.1% to 184.69, Molina dropped 0.5% to 50.49 and Cigna skidded by 1.2% to 126.50. Among the larger players, Aetna lost 1.1% to 119.18, Anthem gave back 0.6% to 130.68 and UnitedHealth was down 0.8% to 138.09.
"
161,AET,"The Obama administration moved Wednesday to crack down on one of the only alternatives to buying an ObamaCare plan in the individual health market.Sales of short-term insurance, for periods of less than a year, have surged in the past few years as relatively young, healthy and middle-class households found they could save a bundle on coverage -- even while paying the individual mandate penalty.Now the Department of Health and Human Services plans to effectively eliminate that alternative to ObamaCare-compliant plans by narrowing the allowable length of short-term coverage to under three months.That seems likely to largely close the door on insurers who saw this lightly regulated segment as an opportunity to make money in the individual market. UnitedHealth (UNH) has sought to tap this opportunity, even as it plans to pull out of almost all of the 35 ObamaCare exchanges where it's operating this year.But UnitedHealth may be more pleased about another Obama administration effort to stabilize the exchange-related markets as insurers are proposing double-digit rate hikes for 2017.HHS said it will revise its risk-adjustment program that’s meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits. By all accounts, the program has done a poor job. As a result, insurers offering broader networks and lower deductibles have taken a financial hit.The risk-adjustment model was based on the experience of the large-group employer market. Yet the ObamaCare exchange market is far different, with a large percentage of customers buying policies for only part of the year and often dropping coverage after running up big bills.UnitedHealth and Aetna (AET) were among the insurers who have complained about short-term customers. On the other hand, Centene (CNC), with typically high-deductible plans and narrow networks, has said it experienced no such issues. Now, HHS says that risk-adjustment will be changed in 2017 to factor in the behavior of partial-year enrollees. Then, in 2018, it will start taking into account prescription drug utilization.In announcing the plan to cut the allowable length of short-term plans to under three months, the Obama administration criticized insurers in that market for engaging in abusive practices.""Some issuers are now offering short-term limited-duration plans to consumers as their primary form of health coverage for periods that last nearly 12 months, allowing them to target only the healthiest consumers while avoiding consumer protections,"" the HHS press release said.Such policies don't have to abide by ObamaCare (Affordable Care Act) rules. As HHS put it: ""They can be priced based on health status ... can discriminate against consumers with pre-existing conditions, and do not have to cover essential health benefits.""To the extent that more attractive short-term policies keep the young and healthy out of the exchange risk pools, rates inside the exchange will be higher, and HHS warned that the problem could grow over time.But the fact that the administration is taking action to stop people who pay the individual mandate penalty from buying plans to their liking also should raise serious questions about ObamaCare. The growth of the short-term insurance market -- by more than 100%, according to a Wall Street Journal report -- is an indication of just how bad a deal many people think they get from ObamaCare.

162,AET,"Shares of Aetna (AET) spiked nearly 4% to a nine-month high in the stock market today after the health insurance giant said it plans to issue some $13 billion in bonds to help pay for its purchase of Humana (HUM). Meanwhile, rival UnitedHealth (UNH) touched a new high.Aetna's big planned debt issuance is a sign that it expects to be able to close its Humana deal ultimately, despite tough regulatory scrutiny. Aetna in July said it would buy Humana for $37 billion, amid a wave of consolidation in the health care industry spurred in part by the Affordable Care Act.Aetna rose 4.1% to 120.03 on the stock market today. Aetna continues to climb out of a consolidation begun a year ago. But the midpoint of the handle is slightly below the midpoint of the base -- making the formation less than ideal for buying. The stock may form another, proper entry point as it builds the right side of its base.Humana followed Aetna's lead Wednesday, jumping 5.6%.UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest health insurer, broke out of a five-week flat base above a prior base, rising 1.1% to 136.04. It hit a record 136.15 intraday.How healthy is UnitedHealth stock, and how does it compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupUnitedHealth last month said it would pull out of most Affordable Care Act exchanges next year after struggling, like others, to find profitability in the marketplaces. However, exchange enrollment has comprised a small portion of the UnitedHealth's overall business.Managed care and several other medical groups rallied Thursday. Medical stocks often do well in markets that are choppy or grinding higher because they offer growth that is largely insulated from economic swings.
"
163,AET,"Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, facing massive losses for its ObamaCare plans, has requested a 58% premium hike for 603,000 customers.The company is pricing in the claims experience of customers that's been far higher than expected after suffering a $770 million loss on its exchange plans in 2015, equal to 26% of premiums.Overall, individual market insurers requested a 35% ObamaCare premium hike for about 1.3 million customers, calculated ACASignups.net, based on the full range of insurer filings available.BCBS of Texas also is seeking an 18% increase for 353,000 members who buy plans via the small group market that caters to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.BCBS of Texas individual market customers will likely have far less expensive options to choose, though not necessarily with the same network of providers. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which this year offers the two least-expensive silver plans in Houston, has requested an average 9.6% hike for its 134,000 exchange customers in the state. Molina said its financial experience ""has met or exceeded expectations.""Yet there's an obvious risk that lower-priced insurers will dramatically underprice their coverage since the huge, costly customer base of BCBS of Texas may be looking for cheaper options. Even though higher subsidies may offset much of the premium hike for those who qualify, the subsidies are set based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. That means even subsidized BCBS customers will face huge premium hikes of 40% or more.Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) is seeking a 15.2% rate hike for 84,000 Texas customers with ObamaCare plans. Centene (CNC) wants a 15.5% rate hike for 47,000 members of its Ambetter ObamaCare plans. Humana (HUM), as in Pennsylvania and Michigan, has requested a rate hike of more than 40%, but has few individual market members in Texas.Insurers in other big states also are requesting major rate hikes, suggesting that the average national rate hike for ObamaCare plans in 2017 may fall closer to 20% than 10%. Insurers in Florida recently requested a 17.7% rate hike, while Pennsylvania market participants are seeking a 24% increase.
"
164,AET,"Mostly bad news continues to roll in on ObamaCare premium hikes requested for 2017, with the latest out of Pennsylvania, where insurers are seeking rate increases of 24% for 500,000 individual market customers.That follows recent news from Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation that insurers are seeking an average 17.7% rate increase for exchange plans in the Sunshine State.In Virginia, which Hillary Clinton hopes to keep in the Democratic column, insurers proposed an average 18% ObamaCare premium hike last month.Customers will get their first peek at their 2017 premiums in the weeks before the voters go to the polls in November, which could deliver uncomfortable headlines for Democrats in presidential swing states if the election is competitive in the fall. While the vast majority of plan shoppers qualify for subsidies that will limit the increase in after-subsidy premiums, many also may be on the hook for higher deductibles.""Based on 2016 membership, claims experience for this market has been worse than anticipated,"" Aetna (AET) said in requesting a 17.2% rate hike for its 47,000 members in Pennsylvania with ObamaCare plans sold on and off the exchange.Highmark is seeking an average 41.4% rate hike for 60,000 members after losing more than $300 million on its individual market business in 2015.In Florida, Aetna's Coventry Health Care unit is seeking 17% rate hikes for about 200,000 customers. Humana (HUM), which will merge with Aetna if regulators approve, has requested a 43.6% rate hike for its nearly 100,000 individual market customers in the state.Molina (MOH) has proposed an average 11.3% rate hike for 250,000 members in Florida.Centene (CNC), which has requested just a 4.6% hike for its Ambetter plans in Florida, looks likely to further separate itself as the low-cost insurer on the exchange in Florida, as well as other states where it is competing. Yet Centene stands out in another way too: sky-high deductibles for silver plans that will rise to $7,050 in 2017.While Donald Trump has vowed to replace ObamaCare with an ill-defined alternative, Hillary Clinton is proposing to provide bigger subsidies to take the sting out of premiums and drug spending.A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation out last week found that 45% of people with ObamaCare individual market coverage see their plans as a good value, down from 55% in 2014. As premiums and deductibles continue rising, that number is likely to keep shrinking, even though the survey doesn't reflect the sentiments of people who turned down the coverage after window shopping or selected a plan and never paid.
"
165,AET,"Health Care: Shortly after President Obama took office, the insurance industry announced that it would help him pass health reform. It has since learned that getting in bed with the government often comes at a steep price.“You have our commitment to play, to contribute, and to help pass health care reform this year,” Karen Ignagni, then head of the industry trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans, told Obama at a March 2009, meeting at the White House.At the time it probably seemed like a good deal. In exchange for giving up its ability to turn down customers or charge them more if they are sick, insurers would get something no other industry has: a federal requirement that people buy their product.Investors saw it as a good deal, too, with insurance company stocks soaring as ObamaCare was debated and passed.Today, insurers who thought they were getting a sweet deal from the government have been losing money hand over fist on their ObamaCare insurance business. That has forced them to raise premiums at rates that were virtually unheard of before ObamaCare.IBD’s Jed Graham has been tracking the current round of rate requests, and they are truly eye-popping. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, to cite just one example, has put in for a 58% increase in premiums for its 603,000 customers. It lost $770 million on its exchange plans in 2015. Proposed hikes of similar sizes are popping up all over the country.These hikes are coming on top of what are already expensive insurance plans. In North Carolina, the cheapest Bronze plan for a family of four that isn’t eligible for ObamaCare subsidies costs almost $12,000 a year in premiums, and comes with a $13,700 deductible.Not surprisingly, the share of people who think their ObamaCare plan is a good value has already dropped from 55% in 2014 to 45% this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Massive rate hikes will only further depress the market, which is already vastly underperforming. Instead of 30 million new customers some expected, the Congressional Budget Office now figures ObamaCare enrollment will top out at 18 million. Aetna (AET) reported a 4% drop in enrollment this March, compared with the year before.As a result, the government-run insurance market is still incredibly unstable, even as government subsidies meant to paper over the transition hurdles are ending, and insurers are quickly trying to merge to cope with the costs.On top of all this, ObamaCare’s failure seems only to be fueling greater interest in a single-payer system, which would wipe out the private insurance industry altogether.One would hope that other industries looking to team up with the federal government would see all this and fight against any and all further encroachment into the private sector.Follow IBD Editorials on Twitter: @IBDeditorials.

166,AET,"Reports continue to flow in of big ObamaCare premium spikes that will hit exchanges around the country in 2017.Insurers are seeking an average 27% rate hike in Oregon; 21% in Maine; 18% in Virginia; and 18% in Florida.But if the premiums don't shock you, the deductibles very well might. Not only are bronze deductibles rising as high as $7,150 in 2017, from a maximum of $6,850 this year, but silver deductibles of $6,000 or more are becoming commonplace. In fact, Centene (CNC), one of the most aggressive exchange competitors when it comes to pricing, is planning to roll out a new silver plan with a $7,050 deductible next year under the Ambetter name — to go along with the $6,500-deductible silver plan it's already offering. Amazingly, Ambetter had just a $1,750 silver-plan deductible in 2014.The problem for exchange shoppers is that ObamaCare premium subsidies are set based on the cost of the second cheapest silver plan in each market. The effect of Centene's sky-high-deductible strategy is to scrunch down silver-plan premiums closer to the cost of a bronze plan and shrink the government subsidies that are supposed to help make coverage affordable. If customers don't like the cheap Ambetter silver plans on offer, they'll have less of a subsidy to buy a bronze plan or a silver plan from a competitor.Thanks to Centene, the subsidy available to 30-year-olds earning $30,500, just over 250% of the poverty level, will shrink from about $627 this year to $571 next year in Indianapolis, an IBD analysis finds.Centene pursued the same hard-nosed strategy this year, selling silver plans with bronze-like deductibles of $5,500 and $6,500 in Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. While its cheap silver plans have helped the company boost enrollment, it's no coincidence that those three markets are the most expensive major markets on HealthCare.gov for buying subsidized bronze plans.While Centene filings have only been made public for Indiana, Ambetter plan designs in the Hoosier State mirror those in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state this year, so those states and others also may see $7,050 silver deductibles in 2017.As IBD noted recently, Blue Cross of Idaho plans to offer a $6,850-deductible silver plan in 2017, which would make a pregnant woman pay $7,010 for delivery of her baby. Blue Cross of Idaho’s highest silver-plan deductible this year is $4,000. But after hiking premiums about 22% last year and being underpriced by competitors, the company may be turning to a much higher deductible as a way to hold down premium price hikes for 2017.The story for Centene is much different. The company, which expanded from Medicaid managed care into the individual commercial insurance market with the launch of ObamaCare, is one of the few insurers making solid profits on the exchange. Although other insurers in Indiana are seeking double-digit price hikes, and Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 30% increase, Centene has proposed a 5.3% rate cut.Aetna (AET), which saw its ObamaCare enrollment shrink from a year ago in the first quarter, filed to begin offering exchange coverage in parts of Indiana and will apparently start with the lowest-cost bronze plan on the market, just 3.6% higher than this year's cheapest bronze plan. Yet because of the smaller subsidy, the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan will rise 7.6%.Aetna's lowest-cost silver plan, by the way, will carry a $6,075 deductible, though the maximum out-of-pocket spending on medical services also will be capped at $6,075, below ObamaCare's $7,150 maximum for 2017.While the high silver-plan deductibles can leave people on the hook for huge expenses before insurers pay much in the way of benefits, they're not as bad as they sound, because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met. Aetna's plan charges $10 per primary care visit (excluding x-rays), $10 for laboratory tests and $5 for generics, but plan members are on their own for most big-ticket items.Before Ambetter's $7,050 deductible is met, members can pay $30 for a primary-care visit and $60 for a specialist; $15 for generics; $50 for preferred brand drugs; $100 for urgent care; $30 for prenatal and postnatal care; and $60 for diabetes management. But that still leaves huge holes for surgery, MRIs, specialty drugs; hospitalization and more.Another important consideration is that the full deductibles only apply to individuals and families earning more than 250% of the poverty level. Those with lower incomes get extra cost-sharing subsidies -- the subsidies that a federal judge just ruled have been funded without authorization and in violation of the Constitution.But those subsidies are pretty meager for people earning between 200% and 250% of the poverty level. For this modest-income group, Aetna's $6,075 deductible is only reduced to $4,875, while Centene's $7,050 deductible is reduced to $5,250.Centene’s high deductibles may be one reason that the company, unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), has said it didn’t experience any problems with people signing up for coverage midyear and running up big bills. People with urgent health needs are more likely to pay up for plan that limits out-of-pocket costs and provides a broad network of hospitals.ObamaCare was supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick, but risk-adjustment hasn’t worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk. Now the Obama administration is focused on making risk-adjustment work better, with uncertain implications for insurers’ profitability.

167,AET,"The Obama administration violated the constitution by funding ObamaCare subsidies without an appropriation, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.The subsidies at issue provide cost-sharing support that cut ObamaCare's high deductibles for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level. While the 2010 health law clearly makes an appropriation for premium subsidies, there's no such appropriation for cost-sharing subsidies.The White House initially requested an appropriation from Congress for the cost-sharing subsidies, which are expected to cost $130 billion over the coming decade. But when the House showed no sign of complying, Obama administration officials asserted the authority to pay out the subsidies anyway, saying the two sets of subsidies were inextricably linked.""The question is whether (the cost-sharing subsidies) can nonetheless be funded through the same, permanent appropriation (as the premium subsidies). It cannot,"" U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer wrote.Her ruling orders an immediate end to the subsidies, which are critical to making ObamaCare exchange coverage viable for low-income individuals and families. Yet Collyer stayed her order pending a certain appeal.With insurers in the process of setting premium rates for 2017, the ruling will create uncertainty about how the exchanges will operate next year.Already UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it will exit most exchanges, while Humana (HUM) is leaving some and planning big premium hikes in others. UnitedHealth fell 0.7% to 129.74 while Humana dropped 2.5% to 165.81 in the stock market today.  Among other major insurers, Anthem (ANTM) lost 2.5% to 136.08, Aetna (AET) fell 3.3% to 108.60 and Cigna (CI) dropped 1.9%.The effect of ending the subsidies is complicated by the fact that the law requires insurers to provide the cost-sharing support. Really the only way they'll be able to do so without losing money is to raise premiums to offset their extra costs, but that would only exacerbate ObamaCare's current difficulties by driving relatively healthy customers away.Even legal experts sympathetic to ObamaCare had said that appropriations law is straightforward and that President Obama broke the law. The only hope for the White House was that the judge would rule that the House lacked standing to sue. That was a real question because such a grant of standing was unprecedented. While the Obama administration argued that the House couldn't sue over questions of how a law is interpreted, Judge Collyer saw the question as a constitutional issue, not a statutory dispute.Uncertainty over the lawsuit's eventual outcome is heightened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and his eventual replacement, which could tilt the court in either direction. It's probably unsafe to assume that a more liberal court will side with the Obama administration. If there was ever a case in which the power of the purse was jeopardized, this was it. Not only did the White House assert the authority to spend money without an appropriation of Congress, but it determined to do so on a permanent basis.
"
168,AET,"Federal regulators have been on a roll when it comes to blocking proposed megamergers.The Staples (SPLS)-Office Depot (ODP) deal is simply the latest casualty. The victims have come from all walks of corporate life, from oilfield services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cable television titans Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Several more big takeovers are threatened. Health insurance behemoths Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are looking to recite corporate nuptials as are Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), but already regulators are whispering their concerns. The  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal also is in doubt.Is it politics, or happenstance? San Diego State University finance professor Nikhil Varaiya, an expert on M&A activity, cautions not to read too much into it even though there has been heightened scrutiny of mergers in the last year of the Obama administration. Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""
"
169,AET,"Humana (HUM) wasn't kidding when it hinted last week of big premium hikes for 2017 in those ObamaCare markets where it remains.This year, the nation's fifth-largest insurer offers the cheapest bronze and silver plans in Michigan's largest market, including Detroit. But Humana has filed for a 50% premium hike for its low-cost silver plan.The unsubsidized cost for a 40-year-old will jump from $210 a month to $315, if approved. On top of that, the maximum out-of-pocket cost for plan members will rise 9%, to $7,150 from $6,300 in 2016.Meanwhile, Humana wants a 38% premium increase for its lowest-cost bronze plan, from $178 a month to $246.Rate requests for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, an important player in the state, aren't yet available. But Humana isn't the only exchange participant eyeing massive premium hikes. Health Alliance Plan, a subsidiary of the Henry Ford Health System, has requested 30% premium hikes for its least expensive bronze and silver plans.But one carrier, so far, stands out as an exception. Molina Healthcare (MOH), is seeking just a 2% premium hike for its lowest cost bronze and silver plans. Even so, Molina's requested premium for its lowest-cost silver plan is 11% higher than Humana's this year, $234 per month vs. $210 for a 40-year-old. Also, while keeping its bronze premium hike to a minimum, Molina is boosting its deductible by one-third, to $6,650 from $5,000.Still, it appears that Molina, which was already one of the lowest-priced insurers in the state, may have an opportunity to grow by leaps and bounds in Michigan.Molina and Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care provider that established an individual market presence with the launch of ObamaCare, have seen exchange enrollment surge. Molina said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago. But Molina's management said on its first-quarter earnings call that the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions. Earnings slipped to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.Molina seemed to indicate that its higher-than-expected costs stemmed from Medicaid enrollees, saying that the company expects 2016 exchange customers will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers. Still, the recent slip-up and the huge premium hikes being sought by rivals raise a question of whether Molina has a secret sauce that's letting it deliver care much more efficiently or whether it risks getting swamped by unexpectedly high costs.Another unknown for Molina is how it will be impacted by ObamaCare's evolving risk-adjustment program. That program is supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. Risk adjustment hasn't worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk, but there seems to be growing recognition that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.UnitedHealth has said it will exit all but a handful of state exchanges for 2017. Humana, which is aiming to close its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of 2016, has already declared its intention to pull out of the exchanges in Alabama, Wisconsin, Virginia and Kansas.So far only Oregon, where insurers are requesting an average 27% premium hike, and Virginia, where insurers want an 18% hike, are the only two states to make all rate filings available. 
"
170,AET,"Oregon's largest individual market insurer has filed for an average 29.6% rate hike for 2017 policies sold on and off the ObamaCare exchange.Providence Health, which saw enrollment nearly quadruple in 2016 to 100,900, grabbing 40% of the market, blamed the increase partly on next year's phase-out of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which covers some of the bills of the costliest patients.But Providence also is pricing in a 5-percentage-point hike because it expects 2017 customers to be in poorer average health. That's in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market — especially relatively healthy customers.Moda Health, Oregon's second-biggest individual market carrier even after losing one-third of its customers following a big premium hike this year, has proposed a 32.3% premium hike for its 62,600 customers.Premera Blue Cross, the fourth-place insurer through its LifeWise Health Plan, has said it's bailing out of Oregon amid financial losses.Overall, Oregon insurers are seeking an average 27% premium hike, as calculated by ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net, weighted based on 2016 enrollment.Oregon is just the second state to make public initial rate requests filed by all insurers for 2017. Participants in Virginia's market are seeking an average 17.9% hike, including a 15.8% increase requested by Anthem (ANTM) for its 180,000 members in ObamaCare-compliant plans.In New Hampshire, Minuteman Health, the lowest-cost and second-largest exchange participant, has requested a 45.2% premium hike.Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) offered a somewhat bleak take on its ObamaCare experience in 2016 in its first-quarter earnings report, saying it may exit a number of states. UnitedHealth (UNH) recently said it would exit all but a ""handful"" of ObamaCare exchanges.Humana, which is aiming to finalize its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of the year, said its renewing customers ""were higher utilizers (of medical services and prescriptions) than those terminating coverage.""In addition, new customers signing up for Humana's off-exchange plans had higher hospital admission rates than renewing customers. Off-exchange plans are the same as those sold on the exchanges, but enrollees can't qualify for the exchange subsidies available to those with income up to 400% of the poverty level.Humana said it will try to make changes to retain a viable product, where feasible, but that's likely to mean ""certain statewide market and product exits both on and off exchange, service area reductions and pricing commensurate with anticipated levels of risk by state.""The company has 554,300 ObamaCare exchange customers and an additional 208,700 in the same plans bought off the exchanges. The total is down by about 180,000 from a year ago, in part because Humana discontinued plans serving 100,000 people due to unexpectedly high costs.Humana, Aetna and UnitedHealth shares fell less than 1% in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Anthem lost 2.3%. 
"
171,AET,"Aetna (AET) reported 911,000 ObamaCare exchange members as of March 31, down more than 4% from over 950,000 at the same time a year ago.The news is somewhat of a surprise after Anthem (ANTM) said it saw a modest increase in customers largely thanks to nonprofit co-ops going out of business in some of its 14 markets like New York and Colorado.Anthem ObamaCare enrollment rose 8.6% to 975,000, from 898,000 a year ago.Centene (CNC), a Medicaid insurer specialist that's rapidly expanding its ObamaCare exchange reach with low-premium, high-deductible plans, recently reported a 55% enrollment spike to 683,000. UnitedHealth (UNH) had 795,000 exchange customers at the end of Q1, but has said it will exit all but a ""handful"" of states in 2017.Total exchange sign-ups rose 8.5% to 12.7 million, from 11.7 million a year ago, but it's not yet clear how many people actually paid. Last year, 1.5 million had dropped out by the end of March.Reports from six states show that ObamaCare enrollment has shrunk about 14% from the number reported in February, but it’s unclear if that trend will hold.Aetna management expressed optimism that its exchange business will break even in 2016, though it's still getting a feel for the medical costs of this year's members, given the relatively large amount of customer churn from year to year.Overall, Aetna's ObamaCare-compliant enrollment, including off-exchange customers, fell to 1.2 million from 1.275 million a year ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said he sees the exchange business as a good investment for the company, despite modest losses so far, provided that Congress and the next president are able to set politics aside and modify the program, as they do for Medicare and Medicaid on a pretty regular basis.Aetna shares rose modestly on the stock market today on stronger-than-expected Q1 results.
"
172,AET,"Molina Healthcare (MOH) said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago, but its earnings dived and shares tumbled 18% early Friday.Management said the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions.In an earnings call, management pointed to those stresses as part of the reason for its setback in controlling customer medical care costs, which rose to 89.8% of premium revenue from 88.7% a year ago. Earnings fell to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.But CEO Joseph Molina said the primary reasons for its big earnings miss were ""the general failure of Medicaid rates to keep pace with the growing medical care costs,"" higher utilization by customers in Texas and Ohio, and higher-than-expected pharmacy costs -- especially for high-cost specialty drugs.Molina's news appeared to weigh on the entire sector -- even among competitors that have reported their own earnings in recent days. Shares of Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care company seeing big exchange membership gains, slipped 4%. UnitedHealth (UNH) eased 1.5%; Aetna (AET) 2.3%; and Anthem (ANTM) 2.6%.The company, whose 4.2 million plan members include 339,000 in Puerto Rico, also highlighted the uncertain risks it faces from the Zika virus.""While very few of the expectant mothers among our membership have contracted the virus, the full financial effects of Zika will not likely be known for several months,"" Molina said.Molina's exchange customer base has tended to be relatively low cost, requiring the company to transfer funds to insurers with higher-cost members via ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program. Updated risk-adjustment estimates were one reason for Molina's lower premium revenue per member in the first quarter, the company said. Though it's too early to know much about the new customers, Molina expects that they will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers.Molina didn't say where its exchange membership surge came, but Texas looks to be one market where it gained market share. Molina now offers the two lowest-cost silver plans in Houston, having displaced Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas and another carrier.
"
173,AET,"Anthem (ANTM) said its ObamaCare exchange business gained market share in states like New York and Colorado, where nonprofit, government-funded co-ops went bust.The removal of low-priced competitors helped Anthem grow its exchange customer base to 975,000 at the end of the first quarter, up from 898,000 a year earlier. However, it's too early to tell whether its customers will be more or less costly than expected.Unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), which is pulling out of most of its exchange markets, Anthem has committed to the exchange business for the long haul. That's both because of long-term potential and short-term political necessity, as it seeks regulatory approval for its merger with Cigna (CI).Likewise, Aetna (AET) must maintain and grow its exchange presence -- at least in Florida -- to close its merger with Humana (HUM). State regulators said the combined Aetna-Humana must expand to five additional counties by 2018 and statewide by 2020.While Anthem officials said the company's exchange business is trending in the right direction, they still see a cloudy future.In an earnings call, Anthem CEO Joe Swedish described the company as well positioned ""if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level,"" alluding to appropriate risk-based pricing of premiums.Later, he said, ""maybe a sustainable model can be built.""Swedish noted that Anthem is pressing the Obama administration to fix the risk-adjustment program that shifts funds from plans that attract healthier customers to those that attract sicker ones. He's also looking for a narrowing of the exceptions that allow people to enroll outside the open-enrollment period to start the year. Another stated problem is the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills run up by customers for a month after they've stopped paying premiums.Lastly, Anthem is looking for the flexibility to offer different types of coverage than currently allowed.The end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which reimburses insurers for some of the claims of its costliest members, will alone boost premiums by 5% to 6% in 2017, Anthem said.The company has filed for a 15.8% premium hike in Virginia, where it had about 180,000 individual market customers, both on and off the exchange, in 2015. A filing by Anthem said its HealthKeepers plan got back $65 million in reinsurance payments from the government last year.

174,AET,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year. But that couldn't shake the gloom surrounding retail and consumer stocks.Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) tumbled on dismal first-quarter reports and/or guidance. Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time. Separately, Apple will invest $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service and app. Apple stock fell 2.4% to its lowest level since June 2014 and lost its market cap crown, barely, to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Amazon intensified its rivalry with Alphabet’s Google by launching a new video streaming service comparable to YouTube. Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before.

Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views.

175,AET,"The first ObamaCare requests for 2017 premium hikes are now being filed and the initial news looks bad — at least in Virginia.Anthem (ANTM) HealthKeepers, one of the biggest players in the state's individual market, is seeking an average 15.8% rate hike for a projected 190,000 members, both on and off the exchange.Anthem cited medical inflation, increased utilization, new specialty drugs for Hepatitis C; and the expiration of ObamaCare's reinsurance program that covers a portion of claims for the costliest patients.Innovation Health, a partnership in Virginia 50% owned by Aetna (AET), is seeking a 16.6% rate increase for 61,000 members.UnitedHealth (UNH), which has dropped out of Arkansas and Georgia, is at least keeping its options open in Virginia. It submitted a filing requesting a 9.4% rate increase for its 6,900 members, according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Overall, the average weighted premium-hike request appears to be 17.9%, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.The rate increases may turn out to be quite small for those who qualify for subsidies. The average premium hike for the subsidized population was just 4% in 2016, the Obama administration said on Tuesday.Consumers may be able to switch to cheaper plans, which might also hold down their premium increases. But all of the carriers except for UnitedHealth appear to be seeking double-digit increases in Virginia. A couple of carriers with a combined 40,000 customers, CareFirst BlueChoice and Optima Health, are seeking rate increases in excess of 30%.      
"
176,AET,"Next year, the combination of a sicker-than-expected insured group and the end of a temporary ObamaCare program to offset the cost of the sickest patients will send premiums soaring in Virginia, the first state where 2017 rate filings have been made public.Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 15.8% rate hike in Virginia for ObamaCare plans that cover about 180,000 members on and off the exchange. But that's actually a bit below the average rate hike that state insurers requested: 17.8%, as calculated by ACASignups.net, which tracks ObamaCare enrollment.The details behind Anthem's requested price hike highlight one reason why ObamaCare exchange premiums throughout the U.S. may be in for a big hike in 2017: the end of the three-year reinsurance program.In 2016, the program covered 50% of bills between $90,000 and $250,000 that an insurer incurred for patients. For the Anthem HealthKeepers plans in Virginia, it translated to about $65 million in payments from the government, helping cut outlays on benefits by about 10%, filings show.On the other hand, Anthem had to transfer about $20 million to other insurers under ObamaCare's ongoing risk-adjustment program, which provides for transfers to insurers that wind up with a sicker overall population.Excluding such transfers, Anthem's incurred costs equaled 90.5% of premiums collected, leaving a narrow margin to cover administrative costs, much less profit.Doubts about whether ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program is accurately compensating insurers has led to complaints from UnitedHealth (UNH) and generated strong criticism from independent policy experts.The biggest apparent beneficiary of the risk-adjustment program was Optima Health, which received nearly $36 million in transfers from other insurers on top of nearly $21 million in reinsurance for its 34,000 members.Without such help, Optima would have been sunk. It reported that incurred claims totaled 105% of premiums. As it is, the insurer is requesting a 37% rate hike and said that it will exit a number of Virginia's regions.Humana (HUM), a small player in Virginia, submitted notice on Friday that it's quitting the state's individual market. Aetna (AET) unit Coventry has yet to submit a rate request, so it's not yet clear if it will remain in the market. Aetna does have a 50% stake in Innovation Health, which is seeking a 16% increase for 61,000 members.On the other hand, both UnitedHealth and Cigna (CI), which would be a new entrant, submitted rate requests, with UnitedHealth seeking a 9.4% rate hike for some 11,000 members, according to ACASignups.Kaiser Foundation Health Plan reported that its incurred costs totaled 94% of premiums in the state, but its request for a 10% rate hike could put it in position to gain market share. One reason why Kaiser could request a below-average rate hike may be that it depended less on the reinsurance program, getting back just $4.4 million.Some insurers also noted other factors contributing to higher rates, including market churn, with customers running up bills and then bolting, and the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills incurred in the first month after customers fail to submit their premium payment.UnitedHealth will kick off earnings for health insurers on Tuesday, with Wall Street investors and health care policy analysts paying attention to any ObamaCare-related comments. UnitedHealth last week said that it would exit the Arkansas and Georgia exchanges. Late Friday, Michigan officials said UnitedHealth would exit that state's exchange. The insurer has warned that it might exit the exchanges entirely.
"
177,AET,"As it reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said it would remain in only a ""handful"" of ObamaCare public exchanges next year, down from 34 state exchanges currently. Shares gapped up 2% near the close.UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said in a post-earnings conference call that the exchange business's smaller market size and ""shorter-term high risk"" suggested that the company could not broadly serve more than a handful of states as part of the Affordable Care Act, and added that UnitedHealth will advocate for ""more sustainable"" strategies.Hemsley offered no specifics as to the states where the company would continue to offer ObamaCare coverage. The insurer is already known to be exiting Arkansas, Georgia and Michigan.""They're experiencing more losses than they anticipated,"" analyst Ana Gupte of Leerink told Investor's Business Daily. ""Very few players are making a positive profit margin.""Georgia is likely UnitedHealth's most unprofitable state, Gupte noted, though she adds analysis of data in filings alone cannot definitively determine profitability of state exchanges. Other likely high-loss states ripe for exit include Florida, North Carolina, New York, Alabama and Louisiana, according to Leerink's analysis.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, said it recognized $125 million in reserves in the first quarter to cover additional exchange-related losses. It had earlier expected $525 million in losses in 2016. But with its whittled-down profile in the exchanges, it doesn't expect negative financial exposure next year.Early indications show that the health status of exchange members got ""a little worse,"" one UnitedHealth executive said in the conference call.The insurer has long been a tentative participant in ObamaCare , shying away from offering coverage under the massive health care plan at first and then working its way in gradually during its first couple of years. The extent of its participation in various state exchanges was limited and far less than other carriers relative to their size such as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).""Aetna and Anthem are more exposed to the individual markets than United so they have less flexibility to leave,"" Gupte said, adding that less than 2% of UnitedHealth's revenue comes from the exchanges.UnitedHealth had around 795,000 exchange-compliant individual enrollees as of the end of the first quarter. Analyst Peter Costa of Wells Fargo pointed out in a note Tuesday that about half of the company's enrollment was new this year, and that these new members ""appeared to have a higher-risk health profile.""UnitedHealth's planned exits means it'll be more likely that the pending megamergers between Anthem and Cigna (CI) and Aetna and Humana (HUM) will be approved by regulators, partly because the consolidations will help to preserve access to exchange marketplaces, Gupte noted.UnitedHealth's overall first-quarter results were relatively strong, driven in part by strength in its Optum health services business, which uses advanced data analytics and technology. Total revenue rose 25% over last year to $44.53 billion, above the $43.96 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.81 a share, compared with expectations of $1.72.Net margin in the quarter declined to 3.6% from 4% a year earlier. UnitedHealth's medical care cost ratio -- the proportion of revenue spent on providing health services -- in the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year to 81.7%, reflecting an extra calendar day of service in the quarter, the company said. Medical cost trends in the quarter ""were well-controlled and consistent with management expectations,"" the company stated in the release.The company said it expects adjusted earnings for 2016 of $7.75 to $7.95 vs. prior guidance of $7.60 to $7.80, above analysts' views of $7.73, on revenue of $182 billion, up from $157.1 billion in 2015 and also above views.""As individual exchange losses are eliminated in 2017, bottom-line growth is likely to accelerate,"" wrote analyst Steven Halper of FBR & Co., who raised his 2017 EPS estimate by 10 cents to $8.90.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
178,AET,"A new sheriff is en route, but that hasn't stopped the old sheriff from swinging his corporate billy club around town.The subject is company mergers and the instances in which the administration of President Barack Obama -- who promised to ""reinvigorate"" federal antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail back in 2008 -- is cracking down are piling up. This week, Obama's Justice Department sued to block the $35 billion merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) over antitrust concerns.Also this week, Obama said the Treasury Department had taken further steps to curb tax inversions by which U.S. companies buy a foreign target and then re-domicile to avoid higher taxes. That scuttled a major acquisition on Wednesday as drugmakers Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) called off their $150 billion deal.There also are several other instances in recent weeks and months when the administration has taken aim at big business. So, what gives? Is it a product of last year's robust M&A environment, which saw $4.3 trillion in global deals announced, or symptoms of a White House that critics have accused of being anti-business?""They’re definitely getting more aggressive,"" Max Jacobs, an analyst at London-based investment research house Edison, said of the administration. ""Historically, Obama has been a bit more on the liberal government intervention side of things.""Take the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The deal would have resulted in U.S.-based Pfizer relocating its headquarters to low-tax Ireland to benefit from that nation's 12% corporate tax rate. By doing so, it would have bypassed U.S. rates of 35%, the highest in the industrialized world.Terminating a deal that had been in the works for months, Pfizer now will pay Ireland-based Allergan a breakup fee of $150 million.""There is a political calculation here,"" said Dane Hamilton, editor at Mergermarket, speaking of tax-inversion deals. ""Obviously, the Obama administration would like to stop companies from moving overseas because they generate a lot of tax dollars.""Still, Obama's pending departure in January may not bring much relief. In terms of a friendlier face when it comes to M&A, there is a dearth of obvious presidential candidates at the moment.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's front-runner for president, wants to crack down on inversions, while fellow White House Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the practice a ""tax-scam."" Meanwhile, Republican front-runner Donald Trump and party rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas propose lowering U.S. taxes to ward off inversions, but aren't coming out in support of them.Still, clamping down on tax inversions won't solve the corporate tax code's underlying problems, said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford University.""Our tax system very much put these incentives in place,"" she said. She added, though, that it's becoming more difficult to get inversion deals done.Tax inversions aren't the only target, though. The vigilant antitrust watchman that is the Obama administration has taken aim elsewhere.In addition to antitrust concerns over the Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal, which would combine the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield-services firms, the Justice Department took Electrolux (ELUXY) to trial late last year, causing General Electric (GE) to back out of a $3.3 billion deal to sell its appliances unit. And the Federal Trade Commission has taken Office Depot (ODP) and Staples (SPLS) to trial to block the $6.3 billion deal between the two biggest office-supply chains.There's more. Last year, the administration quashed the $45 billion Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, which would have combined the nation's two largest cable television companies. Yet in 2010, it approved Live Nation Entertainment’s (LYV) merger with Ticketmaster.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which favors more aggressive antitrust law enforcement, said the size of some of the companies merging raises ""red flags for enforcers.""But deals are still being struck despite politicians' griping.Major health insurers Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) combined in a $37 billion deal, and Anthem (ANTM) agreed to buy Cigna (CI) last year for $48.4 billion. The world's two largest beer makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and SABMiller, agreed to combine for $105 billion.For now, though, the old sheriff has a free hand, said Edison's Jacobs.""(Obama) has the benefit of not having to stand for election,"" he said.
"
179,AET,"Six years after the passage of ObamaCare, Republicans are no closer to settling on an alternative way of providing affordable private coverage to people in the individual market.The reason is clear. For all of ObamaCare's serious problems and unpopular mandates, and despite the bad deal it gives to far too many millions of working-class households and young adults, the reality is that it is helping millions of people. Low-income households and people with pre-existing conditions who couldn't afford decent insurance now can get the care they need.The problem with the GOP plans proposed by members of Congress and presidential candidates is that in crafting a deal that works better for people who aren't served well by ObamaCare, they overlook the consequences for those who would be lost without it.Donald Trump's plan would replace ObamaCare's premium and cost-sharing subsidies by letting people deduct individual market premiums from taxes. That would provide help to people in high tax brackets who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies.But consider what it would mean for 64-year-old couples at 150% of the poverty level. Under ObamaCare, they can buy a plan with a $1,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs for about $1,000. Under TrumpCare, the same level of coverage would cost them just as much as an elite mentorship at Trump University: $20,000, or about 80% of their total income. (The higher cost factors in the reduction in subsidies as well as the repeal of ObamaCare's age-rating limit that lowers premiums for older adults.)While Trump's plan is worse than other GOP proposals on this score, they all make it impossible for low earners to afford an appropriate level of insurance. For example, under the Empowering Patients First plan authored by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the same plan that costs that 64-year-old couples $1,000 now might cost $18,000.GOP policymakers seem to understand that they'll have a big problem selling such a change to the public, so a who's who of conservative health experts recently unveiled a plan to kill ObamaCare softly. The trick is that the plan would let people choose between ObamaCare and the GOP vision of reform, the idea being that people will embrace the free-market Republican version of their own volition.""Some individuals would find themselves better off remaining in their ACA-purchased coverage for a time and could do so,"" wrote health policy wonks assembled by the American Enterprise Institute.They add that a GOP version of health reform is ""more likely to be reached if an ACA (Affordable Care Act) replacement plan wisely includes short-term transition provisions to defuse opposition.""Here’s the catch: The people who will have a reason to embrace the GOP plan will tend to be relatively young, healthy, moderate-income individuals who get little or no subsidies from ObamaCare and have to pay a penalty if they don’t buy coverage. Compared with their current treatment, getting even a modest subsidy to buy lower-cost coverage will be a fantastic deal.Draining younger, healthier people from the ACA individual market risk pool would undoubtedly trigger the kind of death spiral that conservatives have warned about, and facing this prospect, many insurers would simply refuse to participate. Already, UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it’s fed up with losing money and will exit the ObamaCare exchange business after 2016 if things don’t turn around. Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM) and many other insurers around the country also are losing money as they cover an insured group that’s less healthy and higher-cost than expected.If any insurers didn’t exit the exchanges at the outset of this transition plan, they would have no choice but to send premiums soaring, which could easily make after-subsidy premiums triple overnight.While Ohio Gov. John Kasich hasn't laid out how he would replace ObamaCare in detail, he seems to be starting with the right idea and likely the only idea that can lead to a workable plan — giving a better deal to the millions who get a bad deal under ObamaCare without taking away the good deal on which millions of vulnerable people depend.Among the few specifics he's offered, Kasich has said he would keep ObamaCare's guarantee that individuals can purchase insurance without being penalized if they are sick. (Trump initially said the same, then put out a plan that said the opposite.) That's a huge red flag for GOP policy wonks — and Democratic ones as well — because they see the individual mandate and coverage guarantee as a package deal: You can’t have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Yet those concerns are relatively simple to address. There is a logical path that starts by offering people a good deal and the flexibility to choose a plan that fits their budget, including no-cost plans that come with a Health Savings Account deposit for modest earners.Other key steps include easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage.Lastly, instead of imposing fines for not buying coverage, the government could gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won’t get sick.

181,AET,"In what appeared to be another of his jaw-droppers, Donald Trump, who has vowed to kill ObamaCare and replace it with ""something terrific,"" seemingly embraced the law's most-detested part: the individual mandate to get coverage or pay a fine.""Well I like the mandate. OK. So here's where I'm a little bit different: I don't want people dying on the streets,"" he told a CNN town hall on Feb. 18.As outraged conservative editorials flooded the Internet the following day, Trump clarified in a tweet that he was referring to the law's requirement that insurers offer people with pre-existing conditions coverage on the same terms offered to people in robust health.Yet, even though his clarification was logical enough based on the wording of the question he was asked, it's safe to say that most of the Republican Party's influential policymakers were hardly assuaged. In their view -- much like the view of the Obama administration -- the individual mandate and coverage guarantee are a package deal: You can't have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Trump has eschewed wonkery and position papers, making a pitch that aims for the gut, backed by the candidate's bravado and little depth of thought. Yet in this case, there's little doubt that Trump is right, that you can have the coverage guarantee without the mandate, and that the solution could be pretty terrific relative to the ObamaCare status quo.It's clear that the individual insurance market is not functioning well even with an individual mandate. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), facing financial losses, have both questioned whether the exchanges are sustainable under current rules.The problem with ObamaCare isn’t that insurers participating on the exchanges are making money hand over fist: many are losing large sums. While more competition is a good thing, Trump’s idea of selling insurance across state lines has little or no potential to change ObamaCare’s dynamics because doing so won’t have a major effect on provider costs or on the population that signs up.The problem is simple: ObamaCare offers such an unattractive deal to so many millions of people that the exchanges are attracting a pool of customers which is too small, too old and too costly. The logical way to fix the individual insurance market is to start by offering people a deal that makes a lot more sense for their finances.To understand how this could work, first consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare from Cigna (CI) this year costs about $2,200, which may not be financially feasible, even before their $1,000 deductible and maximum cost-sharing of $4,500.The couple could instead buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating. Since that's just the situation that ObamaCare was supposed to fix, it seems beyond the pale to force a couple in this situation to buy coverage or pay a fine of $1,390 -- 3.5% of their income. In other words, it's likely that all the options for this couple are bad, unless they happen to be desperate for health coverage, perhaps because they're trying to have a second child.Once you factor in the threat of a tax penalty for those who go uncovered, the reality is that ObamaCare, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support to silver plans, effectively turning the plans to platinum for low-income beneficiaries. The cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Simply getting rid of the individual mandate could lead millions of people to drop coverage, sending rates through the roof. But what if, for starters, the government offered that cost-sharing support directly to individuals, instead of paying it out to insurers? If this were done while easing ObamaCare's age-rating restriction (for bronze plans only) that artificially inflates the cost of coverage for young adults — a bronze plan costs $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if each earn $25,000 — the deal offered to this 30-year-old couple would be transformed. They could still get the same level of coverage offered by silver, but if they opted for bronze-level coverage, their policy would cost nothing (vs. $1,260 under ObamaCare today), and they'd have $800 in a Health Savings Account to put toward medical bills (assuming a 4:1 age-rating for bronze). Clearly, no mandate would be needed to get modest-income households to sign up for this kind of coverage.This approach resembles the Republican idea of giving people a subsidy and, if they choose catastrophic coverage that costs less, letting them keep what is left over. The problem with GOP plans offered to date is that they make comprehensive coverage a whole lot less affordable for people who really need it — dramatically so for older people with modest incomes.The potential fallout from taking away coverage that millions are depending on explains why a who's who of GOP policy wonks has come up with the idea of killing ObamaCare softly -- letting people opt into a Republican vision of health reform and leaving the exchanges to gradually fade away. The only problem is that their idea of a gradual phase-out has zero chance of working.What's needed is an approach that offers a good deal to the millions who don't get one under ObamaCare, while continuing to meet the needs of the millions who are happy with their deal. There's no reason it can't work and there's no reason it can't be done without a heavy-handed mandate.The keys are giving people much more flexibility over how they use their subsidies; easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time  workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage. Lastly, instead of penalizing for not buying coverage, the government could very gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won't get sick.

182,AET,"Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.2% from a year ago, the fastest annual rise since June 2012, the Labor Department said.Overall prices were unchanged for the month and up 1.4% from a year ago. Energy costs slid 2.8% for a second straight month, but the yearly decline slowed to 6.5% vs. 12.6% in December and 18.4% in September, as comparisons get tougher.Core prices were driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing, including lodging away from home.Health insurance costs rose 1.1% for the month and 4.8% from a year ago — the biggest increase since April 2013, before the ObamaCare exchanges were launched. Although subsidies help reduce the prices, inflation measures take into account the added government costs as well. Despite rising premiums, UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have warned of losses in the exchanges, with UnitedHealth the most explicit about possibly exiting the market if conditions don't improve.The cost of medical care rose 0.5% in January, bringing the yearly increase to 3%, tied for the highest since early 2013. Prescription drug companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD)and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX)  have been under fire for high costs, but the annual rise in prescription costs has decelerated to 3% from 6.4% at the end of 2014.The cost of medical service rose 0.5% for the month and 3.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual rise since April 2013.Rent of primary residence rose 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year ago, matching December's annual gain for the biggest since June 2008.Lodging away from home, which sees volatile swings from month to month, rose 2% in January and 3.1% for the year.All items excluding food, shelter and energy still were up a more moderate 1.5% from a year ago.The core inflation rate has risen above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. But the Fed pays more attention to another price gauge, the core PCE deflator, which has shown little pickup in recent months.UnitedHealth shares fell fractionally on the stock market today in morning trade. Aetna, Humana and Gilead Sciences fell 1.3%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals tumbled 7.6% after Wells Fargo downgraded the drugmaker, saying there are ""too many questions.""

183,AET,"Health Reform: It wasn’t that long ago when ObamaCare fans were wagging their fingers at critics, saying industry profits proved that the law was working. They’ve been noticeably silent as insurers report huge losses.“It turns out that the law that the insurance industry's shills demonized has been awfully good to insurance-company investors.” That was from a piece in the Huffington Post almost exactly a year ago, after UnitedHealth Group released its Q1 earnings.The writer went on to point out that the good news was reported in the pages of IBD, while our editorial page has long been critical of the law. “I can't wait,” Wendell Potter concluded, “to see how IBD's editorial writers spin UnitedHealth's ObamaCare success.”We can’t wait to see how Potter and other ObamaCare fans are spinning the law’s “success,” now that insurance companies are showing big, sustained losses and threatening to pull out of the program next year.The latest to join the list is Humana, which just reported that profits fell 30% in the last quarter of 2015 and has set aside a reserve for expected losses this year. It’s now saying it “continues to evaluate its participation” in the individual insurance market.A few days earlier, Aetna said it lost up to 4% on its ObamaCare policies in 2015 and said it had “serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.”And UnitedHealth Group said it expects losses from its ObamaCare enrollees to top $650 million this year and next. “We cannot sustain these losses,” is how CEO Stephen Hemsley put it.Humana, as with other insurers, discovered that ObamaCare enrollees were sicker and more expensive to cover than they anticipated. And worse, they're finding that ObamaCare officials are letting too many people game the system by waiting until after they are sick to enroll for coverage, knowing they can get it guaranteed.Spiraling premiums, an unstable insurance market, people gaming the system. These were predictions made by ObamaCare’s free market critics, including IBD, who said this is where the law's mountain of regulations would inevitably lead.So, what say you now, ObamaCare fans?
"
184,AET,"At the close of the third sign-up season for ObamaCare, 12.7 million people had selected plans, the Obama administration reported on Thursday. It's not yet clear how many of those are paying customers, though well more than 1 million will likely never submit a payment, based on last year's experience.While the Obama administration, as always, hailed the results as evidence the public insurance exchanges are working, it is clearly bad news. Even with an individual mandate penalty for going without coverage -- a minimum of $695 per uninsured adult in 2016 -- half or more of those eligible for subsidies still haven't enrolled.The news is bad for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), who had hoped to see a broader, healthier risk pool and are now questioning the sustainability of the exchanges. Above all, it's bad for millions and millions with modest or moderate incomes, who faced an unhappy choice between paying for a plan they couldn't afford or paying a fine and praying that they'd stay healthy.Supporters argue that the reason so few people are signing up is that they don't know enough about ObamaCare. Yet there's a much simpler explanation as to why people would spurn ObamaCare coverage as such a bad deal that they'd rather risk paying a penalty: Either the silver-plan premiums are too high for them to afford -- even with subsidies -- or the common $6,000-plus deductibles make bronze plans of marginal usefulness.While the Obama administration thinks it's a success when anyone signs up for a plan, it's hard to see why. Preliminary data suggest that many of the new enrollees may have opted for a low-cost bronze plan to avoid a fine -- even if the unrealistic deductible would torpedo their finances if they actually have a health emergency.The Urban Institute estimated that 24 million people would be eligible for exchange subsidies this year. The Congressional Budget Office had projected that an annual average of 15 million people would receive subsidies this year, but last month it cut that estimate to 11 million. The data released by HHS on Thursday suggest that 10 million or fewer subsidized customers will hold policies once payments are submitted, and that number is likely to dwindle as the year progresses.After three years of enrollment, it's now fair to say that the reality of the individual mandate penalty is much harsher than the way that the Obama administration advertised it. Back then, the White House described it as ""a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance -- even though they can afford it.""The lack of any sizable jump in enrollment from last year's 11.7 million signup total is sending a jarring message. Consider that HHS pushed enrollment this year by saying most people qualifying for subsidies could get a plan for $900 or less this year. So why would people risk throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash on a penalty? The message is that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.As insurers continue to have their earnings pressured by the individual exchange business, and as the backlash over the individual mandate builds, it will increasingly become evident that the individual exchanges can't be made to work well unless Congress rolls up its sleeves and fixes them. That would surely require a major rethinking of the law.Department of Health and Human Services officials explained that the 12.7 million sign-up figure understated the gains from last year's 11.7 million figure. That's true to an extent, because perhaps 300,000 people who haven't paid already have had their applications discounted. New York also steered about 200,000 people with income up to 200% of the poverty level from private plans into a government-run version of ObamaCare. That, in itself, was an admission of ObamaCare's affordability shortcomings.Officials continue to celebrate one enrollment data point: Four million ""new"" enrollees signed up for coverage in the 38 states using HealthCare.gov. If that were the case, why did total HealthCare.gov sign-ups rise by less than 1 million? There's a simple reason: ""New"" is defined to include anyone who had previously signed up but never paid, or stopped paying their premium by the fall of 2015. In other words, new enrollees include the usual suspects.

185,AET,"The manufacturing sector contracted modestly for a fourth straight month in January, the Institute for Supply Management said Monday.A further drop in export orders and the weakest read on factory employment since June 2009 offset modest gains in production and new orders.Amid a strong dollar and tepid global growth, there's little surprise that the manufacturing sector is stuck in reverse. The real problem is that the rest of the economy isn't taking up the slack.The consumer also ended the year on a flat note, with personal consumption expenditures unchanged in December after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in November. The data provided further indications that consumers are saving a good portion of their windfall from cheaper gas. Consumers saved 5.5% of disposable income, matching a three-year high.Meanwhile, construction spending rose just 0.1% in December, well below the 0.6% expected, while November was revised to show a bigger decline.The construction sector ""lost all momentum in the fourth quarter,"" noted IHS Global Insight economist Patrick Newport.He expects a 0.15 percentage cut to fourth-quarter GDP growth, based on the weaker construction data.The Commerce Department's advance GDP estimate on Friday showed the economy grew just 0.7% in Q4. While Wall Street economists have penciled in first-quarter growth of 2.4%, on average, the Atlanta Federal Reserve on Monday said that growth is currently tracking at just 1.2% for the quarter.With little hope for a quick upturn in manufacturing, the question is whether something will boost the economy out of its current growth lull, or whether the slowdown will be protracted.Yet the decline in financial markets to start the year presents a new risk, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Monday.""If these developments lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global economy that could affect growth and inflation in the United States,"" he said in a Monday speech.The auto sector had been one of the drivers over the past two quarters but subtracted 0.19 percentage point from GDP in the fourth quarter. U.S. auto sales hit a record 17.47 million in 2015, topping an 18 million annual rate in late 2015. The first read on 2016 sales will come Tuesday, when General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and other automakers release January U.S. sales. General Motors and Ford stock rose more than 1% Monday.The biggest driver of consumption has been health care, which added 0.62 percentage point to GDP last  quarter, or 28% of the consumption gain. On Monday, Aetna (AET) said that while the ObamaCare exchange business may not yet be sustainable, higher premiums and gains in enrollment for its Medicaid and Medicare plans fueled a 12% jump in quarterly profit. Aetna stock rose 1.5% on Monday.The possible ray of light in the manufacturing news is that things have stopped getting worse and may, in time, get better. The ISM manufacturing index rose to 48.2 from 48.0, not too far below the neutral 50 level. New orders picked up to 51.5 from 48.8, while factory inventories fell at the same pace (43.5), a sign that inventories may be getting more in line with demand.But drops in the gauge of export orders (to 47.0 from 51.0) and employment (to 45.9 from 48.0) suggest any progress will be slow in coming.In recent weeks, Caterpillar (CAT) announced a new round of layoffs after sales fell 15% in 2015 amid weak commodity markets. Boeing (BA) said it would scale back production of the 747-8, citing the soft air cargo business. Caterpillar and Boeing stock rose about 1% Monday.Weak manufacturing is among the reasons why private nonresidential construction investment sagged 2.1% in December. Overall, factory construction spending sank 7.3%, while spending on chemical manufacturing sank 8.4%.Single-family and multifamily construction continued to post solid gains and should continue to do so in 2016, thanks to a pickup in household formation by young adults, Newport said.

UnitedHealth undercut its 50-day moving average after attempting a breakout earlier in the week.The lawsuit, filed in 2011 by former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling, was unsealed Thursday.

189,AET,"A key House committee has proposed delaying any changes in Medicaid funding until 2020 to win over moderate Republicans as the effort to repeal and replace the major parts of ObamaCare runs into trouble.Although the ability of Republicans to bridge a wide divide between moderates and conservatives still looks iffy, especially in the Senate, the signal of retreat on Medicaid cuts had the health care sector breathing a sigh of relief.While the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were slightly negative as of early afternoon in the stock market today, health stocks were mostly higher.Among hospitals, HCA Holdings (HCA) closed up 1.4% at 88.53, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 10% to 20.99 and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 2.2% to 125.58.Among insurers, Molina Healthcare (MOH) was unchanged at 49.99, and Aetna (AET) climbed 0.9% to 130.69, while Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) edged up 0.5% 168.20.Drugmakers, which also have benefited from President Trump backing away from earlier threats of an intervention to bring down the high cost of prescriptions, were mixed. Dow component Merck (MRK) rose 0.8%, but Pfizer (PFE), another Dow member, ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which plays a key role in shaping health reform, will release a plan next week maintaining Medicaid funding levels until 2020, before cuts would take effect, the Wall Street Journal reported.The retreat by the House comes as GOP governors have been making their voices heard about preserving ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has embraced the Medicaid expansion, met with Trump a week ago and has been among the leaders of the effort.RELATED:Biotechs Leap On Trump's Calls For Innovation, Speedy FDA ApprovalTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

191,AET,"The reviews for President Trump's speech to Congress were strongly positive, from pundits, the public and, so far, investors. But does the speech really matter.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time at Wednesday's opening bell, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also jumping to record highs. On Tuesday, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1% to end a string of 12 straight gains, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.If Trump is right that the stock market's impressive rise since his election has been driven by his policies, then what he didn't say in his speech matters a whole lot more than anything he did say. (Some of Wednesday's early gains may reflect shifting views and Treasury yields regarding a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting.)He didn't say how he would pay for or when he would advance his trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, a potential boon to Caterpillar (CAT), steel makers like U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), engineering and construction firms like Fluor (FLR) and construction aggregates suppliers like Vulcan Materials (VMC). Could last week's report that the plan will be delayed until 2018 be true? Not clear, but there's more reason to think so after Tuesday night.However, Nucor, U.S. Steel, Vulcan Materials, Caterpillar and Fluor were up 2%-3% in morning action.In any event, there appears to be a logjam of contentious issues blocking the road to more spending on highways and bridges. Trump managed to successfully turn the page after a rocky first five weeks in office in part because he stayed above the fray, declining to take any clear positions on the two issues that could largely determine whether his economic agenda rises or falls: ObamaCare and tax reform.Now he's about to enter a potentially hazardous stretch of his presidency in which he'll have to take firm policy stands that may divide his narrow governing majority in the Senate.On ObamaCare, the issue that Trump said must be addressed before tax reform, the clock is ticking for him to come up with a replacement that can unify Republicans, something that has proved impossible in the seven years since the law's passage. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers rose 1%-2% intraday.Come April, if Republicans haven't gotten their ducks in a row, insurers faced with setting premiums for 2018 will be in full panic mode and may start to pull the plug on their participation in the exchanges, leaving swaths of the country with no insurers for 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Despite growing doubts about the timing and size of President Trump's tax and spending stimulus plans, markets are pricing in higher odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again as early as this month. Tax reform doesn't look to be any easier. Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, but the House proposal for doing so depends on raising $1 trillion with a 20% tax on imports that's being fought by Wal-Mart (WMT) and the entire retail sector. Now General Motors (GM) is calling the tax ""problematic,"" and a growing number of GOP senators oppose the idea.Trump stuck to vague generalities in his speech, saying, ""We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.""Who would oppose that? It's only when he arrives at a plan to pay for it — if not with a border tax then by taking away valued corporate tax subsidies — that the effort will turn into a mud fight.Trump is off to a slow start in clarifying how he will put his economic agenda into action. That's not surprising, because his agenda tackles major problems that have long defied solutions, but it should make investors nervous, regardless of what Trump said last night.RELATED: 
"
192,AET,"President Trump on Monday called the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare ""unbelievably complex"" and said that his tax cut plans will have to wait in line.But Trump sounded all fired up to begin making good on his campaign plans for a massive infrastructure spending boost. That may be the easiest lift because of the bipartisan appeal of creating more construction jobs while making investments in highways, bridges and other productivity-enhancing projects.Trump's comments on Monday lit a fire under infrastructure stocks. Caterpillar (CAT) rose about 2%, U.S. Steel (X) 3.2%, Fluor (FLR) 1.9% and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 2.4%. Those stocks got hammered last week when reports emerged that the White House was thinking of pushing an infrastructure bill to 2018.Yet there still might not be a green light for Trump's infrastructure plans. With the repeal-and-replace plan for President Obama's signature program running into trouble on multiple fronts, it's looking increasingly possible that Republicans will have to signal a retreat before the rest of their economic agenda can advance.According to Trump, everything is under control. He said on Monday that the White House has arrived at a ""really, really good"" solution to ObamaCare that he will discuss Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress.""I think you'll like what you hear,"" he told insurers at the White House on Monday, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).Investor confidence in President Trump may be riding on his Tuesday speech. High hopes for tax cuts, a surge in infrastructure spending and regulatory reform have helped fuel an explosive postelection stock market rally, but doubts have been creeping in about his ability to deliver.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average has rallied for 11 straight sessions as of Friday, the longest winning streak in decades.Trump's vow to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20% may hinge on the House GOP proposal for a 20% border tax that faces serious opposition in the Senate because it pits big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) against exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE).No hint of a Plan B has emerged, and Trump signaled that he won't provide any details that might help investors gauge the prospects for tax reform advancing while ObamaCare is dominating the agenda. Trump's explanation was that tax reform would have to take into account the budget effect of repeal and replace.While there's good reason to expect regulatory reform to ease compliance costs across a wide array of industries, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) also have been lifted by hopes for a lower corporate tax rate and a steeper yield curve, which boosts net interest margins. Yet diminished confidence that a Trump economic package will do much for growth over the next year have led Treasury yields to sag in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet, if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.The White House seems to have gone back and forth on whether it will support a border tax, which would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade and offset the cost of a lower corporate tax rate. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News that he has only just begun to study the border tax proposal. Last week, Mnuchin said the goal was to pass tax reform by August but acknowledged that the timetable could slip.Trump has made clear that figuring out what to do about ObamaCare is the top priority in the short term, but dissension among Republicans about how to replace the law raises the risk of a drawn-out effort, at best, with some risk of a quagmire. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office score of the House's approach to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare reportedly showed a big increase in the ranks of the uninsured, which runs counter to White House promises.Republicans are considering holding a vote to repeal big parts of ObamaCare, even if a victory is uncertain. That may be the best outcome for investors. Win or lose, ObamaCare would fall off the top of the agenda, clearing the way for more growth-oriented policies.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rally As Trump Seeks Defense Budget BoostInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'Steel, Materials, Mining Stocks Dive As Trump Mulls Infrastructure Delay To 2018Will Heavy Construction's Rebound Receive A Trump Infrastructure Boost?If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse

193,AET,"A federal judge late Wednesday blocked the planned Anthem (ANTM) merger with Cigna (CI), ruling that it would be anticompetitive.District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the $48 billion merger would have left too few health insurers to serve employers.Last month, another federal judge stopped Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from combining, also on antitrust grounds.Aetna is still mulling an appeal, but Cigna and Anthem have bickered for months, suggesting their boards may be satisfied with walking away. Anthem faces a $1.85 billion breakup fee payment to Cigna under their deal reached back in July 2015.The Justice Department, under the outgoing Obama administration had objected to the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals.The news was too late for after-hours trading, so investors will have to wait until Thursday's premarket to get an idea of how markets will judge Anthem and Cigna as independent entities.Given the Aetna-Humana decision, Wednesday's ruling wasn't a shock.RELATED:Aetna's $37 Billion Deal For Humana Blocked By Federal Judge

194,AET,"After 18 months of courtship and court cases, two massive deals that would have reshaped the U.S. health insurance industry have both been declared dead, blocked by judges who said they'd do unacceptable harm to competition in the industry.Now, the companies are right back where they started. Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion deal to buy Cigna (CI) was blocked by a federal judge late Wednesday, weeks after another judge halted Aetna's (AET) bid for Humana (HUM). Anthem said it'll appeal, and Aetna and Humana have said they're still deciding where to appeal.The question now becomes what the companies will do with the large piles of cash they allocated for the acquisitions, and whether they'll try anew at fresh takeovers under a Trump administration, whose antitrust officials could be more amenable to large consolidations. They could also opt for something more conservative in the face of widespread uncertainty about the future of the U.S. health system.But first, they may be back in court.""Anthem is significantly disappointed by the decision,"" Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in a prepared statement. ""If not overturned, the consequences of the decision are far-reaching and will hurt American consumers.""Cigna, for its part, said it ""intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options in accordance with the merger agreement."" CEO David Cordani has estimated that his company will have $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital, with the high end including extra debt that the company could take on if it decided to make acquisitions.""We have a track record of being very disciplined relative to our capital priorities and not allowing surplus capital to sit around,"" Cordani said on Jan. 11.Humana may be a target, once again. Cigna or Anthem may make a bid for the Louisville, Ky.-based company, which specializes in the fast-growing business of selling private health plans for the elderly, said Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. Cigna could also bid for WellCare Health Plans (WCG), she said.Also likely are more conservative moves by the companies, like buying back shares or investing in their own businesses, said Sarah James of Piper Jaffray.""The four deal stocks have been hoarding cash for 18 months, and now that the rulings have been announced, we believe the companies will look to deploy the capital,"" she said in a note to clients. ""The companies will most likely favor share repurchases.""The Justice Department, along with the antitrust division that sued to block the deals, could be remade under new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was confirmed Wednesday. While antitrust officials under the Obama administration aggressively blocked a number of megadeals, over time the antitrust laws have ensured some consistency in enforcement between Republican and Democratic administrations.The case is a holdover from the Obama administration, where the Justice Department thwarted several megamergers, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS)""If health-insurance companies are thinking of merging, and they don't really compete with each other, then these decisions shouldn't discourage them,"" said Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Companies with serious overlaps in business would still face obstacles, he said.There's also the risk that Republicans will remake large parts of the U.S. health care system as part of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Insurance executives may wait to see which parts of the industry the new administration and Congress favor before writing checks.The ACA, which expanded the market for Medicaid health plans and for coverage sold to individuals, hasn't been a big driver of growth for any of the firms. Still, its demise could cut off a source of growth at a time when they're looking for ways to expand.""We expect potential buyers to take their time,"" Thomas Carroll, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note. ""In our view, all potential buyers will sit back, see how the new administration reshapes U.S. health care, and digest the deal commentary of the last year and a half.""Anthem has also said it would pursue deals and buybacks as its ""Plan B"" if the Cigna transaction didn't go through. CEO Swedish has said he might attempt to expand in the Medicare Advantage market through acquisitions, for example.The 18-month effort to get the transaction done was marked by discord between Anthem and Cigna. Last year, the companies accused each other of violating the merger agreement, and the government said in court that disputes among executives had undercut the rationale for the deal.The hostility could continue. With the deal defeated, Anthem owes Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee under the terms of the agreement. Anthem wouldn't have to pay the breakup fee if it could prove that Cigna committed a ""willful breach"" of the merger agreement.The disputes, which spilled into court, harmed the deal's chances, said U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson. She called the hostility the ""elephant in the courtroom.""""Cigna officials provided compelling testimony undermining the projections of future savings, and the disagreement runs so deep that Cigna cross-examined the defendants' own expert,"" she wrote. ""Anthem urges the court to look away, and it attempts to minimize the merging parties' differences as a 'side issue,' a mere 'rift between the CEOs.' But the court cannot properly ignore the remarkable circumstances that have unfolded both before and during the trial.""The Anthem-Cigna case turned on the market for health plans sold to employers. In her ruling, Jackson looked at its likely effect on the sale of health insurance to ""national accounts"" — customers with more than 5,000 employees, usually spread over at least two states — within the 14 states where Anthem operates as the Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee.""Eliminating this competition from the marketplace would diminish the opportunity for the firms' ideas to be tested and refined, when this is just the sort of innovation the antitrust rules are supposed to foster,"" Jackson said in her 12-page order. Her accompanying opinion fully detailing her reasons for ruling against the deal was filed under seal.Acting Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Justice Department's antitrust division called the ruling ""a victory for American consumers.""""This merger would have stifled competition, harming consumers by increasing their health insurance premiums and slowing innovation aimed at lowering the costs of health care,"" Snyder said in a statement.

199,AET,"Aetna (AET) ended its $37 billion takeover of Humana (HUM), after deciding not to appeal a ruling by a federal judge who blocked the health insurers' combination on antitrust grounds.The companies came to a mutual agreement to terminate the deal, and Aetna will pay Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, or about $630 million after taxes. A plan to divest some assets to Molina Healthcare (MOH) — a remedy that was rejected by the judge — was also canceled, Aetna said in a statement Tuesday.Aetna and Humana, which had agreed to combine in July 2015, are free to make new deals or spend billions of dollars on buying back their own shares. Another massive health insurance deal, meanwhile, is grinding forward — for now. Anthem said on Monday that it's seeking a fast-track appeal of a different judge's ruling that blocked its own proposed $48 billion acquisition of Cigna (CI).The federal judge who blocked the Aetna-Humana deal on Jan. 23 sided with Justice Department lawyers who said that allowing the insurers to combine would harm competition, mainly in the market for Medicare Advantage plans.""While we continue to believe that a combined company would create greater value for health care consumers through improved affordability and quality, the current environment makes it too challenging to continue pursuing the transaction,"" Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said in the statement. ""Both companies need to move forward with their respective strategies.""On Jan. 31, Aetna had given a forecast for this year's profit that assumed the termination of the Humana and Molina deals.

201,AET,"Aetna's (AET) $37 billion deal to buy rival insurer Humana (HUM) was blocked by a federal judge Monday, thwarting one of two large mergers that would reshape the U.S. health care landscape. Aetna said it was considering an appeal.The transaction would violate antitrust laws by reducing competition among insurers, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates in Washington ruled. With the deal defeated, Aetna owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee under the terms of the merger agreement.Aetna lost 2.5% in midday trades. Humana fell 1.4%. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which would have benefited from a deal to buy divested assets from Aetna and Humana, slumped 2.5%.""We're reviewing the opinion now and giving serious to consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case,"" T.J. Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, said. A Humana spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The ruling is another victory for antitrust enforcement efforts initiated by the Obama administration. A separate Justice Department challenge, against Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion bid for Cigna (CI), is also pending a ruling. Investors saw the ruling as a bad sign for that deal. Anthem fell 1.1%, while Cigna lost 0.5%.""If the judge blocked this deal, there is very little, if any, chance that the Anthem-Cigna deal gets cleared,"" Jason McGorman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said by email. He added that analysts and investors had thought that the Aetna-Humana deal ""had a better chance of settlement/clearance"" than Anthem-Cigna.The Obama Justice Department frustrated a slew of megamergers amid a wave of record deal making, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile US (TMUS). The Trump administration is taking over investigations into AT&T's deal for Time Warner (TWX) and Bayer's (BAYRY) proposed combination with Monsanto (MON).The government case against the merger focused on the market for private health plans for the elderly, known as Medicare Advantage. The U.S. argued the Aetna-Humana deal would have eliminated competition between the insurers in 364 counties in 21 states and likely forced seniors to pay higher premiums for Medicare Advantage plans. It also threatened competition on the insurance exchanges set up under ObamaCare, the Justice Department said.Aetna countered that the Medicare market is much larger than the Justice Department claims because it includes both Medicare Advantage plans and original Medicare, providing more choice for seniors than the government portrayed. Competition on the exchanges isn't an issue, they said, because Aetna withdrew from all 17 counties at issue in the government's case.The judge sided with the government's view of the Medicare Advantage market.""In that market, which is the primary focus of this case, the merger is presumptively unlawful — a conclusion that is strongly supported by direct evidence of head-to head competition as well,"" Bates wrote. ""The companies' rebuttal arguments are not persuasive.""

202,AET,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) beat fourth-quarter earnings forecasts Tuesday, helped by reduced cost pressure from its ObamaCare exchange business.Earnings of $2.11 per share were up 50.7% from a year ago and 4 cents ahead of the consensus. Revenue rose 9.0% to $47.52 billion, topping views of $47.13 billion.The company stood by its financial outlook for 2017: Revenue of $197 billion-$199 billion and adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60. Wall Street analysts see revenue of $198.3 billion and EPS of $9.51.Shares eased by 0.7% to 160.66 on the stock market today, despite the positive tone of the earnings and analyst call.UnitedHealth appeared to be caught up in a downdraft triggered by President-elect Donald Trump's weekend comments that clouded the prospects for corporate tax reform. Aetna (AET) was off 1% to 121.04, Anthem (ANTM) lost 1.2% to 146.75, Cigna (CI) dropped 1.1% to 144.77, while Humana (HUM) shares managed a 0.6% gain to 204.04.While other insurers' shares have been volatile amid ObamaCare woes and the antitrust outlook, UnitedHealth has been a standout stock, driven by its fast-growing Optum health services unit. UnitedHealth, whose shares vaulted above a buy point on Nov. 10 on the way to a 13% postelection rise, had been carving out a tight, constructive consolidation base before Tuesday's volatile session.Optum unit revenue growth temporarily slowed in Q4 due a 4.8% decline in revenues at the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management services unit. That decline reflected a loss of business that had been anticipated when UnitedHealth bought Catamaran.As the first big health insurer to report, UnitedHealth said its medical costs as a share of premium revenue fell 1.9 percentage points to 80.8% in Q4, helped by ""reduced individual market pressure.""While exchange losses were basically in line with expectations in Q4, the real improvement came vs. a year ago when UnitedHealth had recognized a premium deficiency reserve due to its ailing exchange business.UnitedHealth remains in a handful of ObamaCare exchange markets in 2017, but management said it has virtually no earnings exposure to the exchanges this year.The company added 2.2 million insured members in 2016, including 585,000 Medicaid beneficiaries.

Small caps were under pressure during the session, leaving the Russell 2000 with a flat finish.The Dow and S&P 500 backed out of early gains ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's midafternoon policy announcement, although the no-change, no-news release itself appeared to levy little impact on the rest of the day's trade.Today's stock market then turned its attention to Facebook (FB), which reported results after the close. The social media company beat sales and profit expectations, sending its shares up about 2% in extended trading. That would leave Facebook with an all-time high.Apple ended the day up 6% and at an 18-month high after blowing past analyst expectations in its fiscal first-quarter report delivered late Tuesday. At least nine analysts raised their price targets on the stock following the report, in which both sales and earnings growth turned positive after three quarters of declines.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) flashed 16% higher in a powerful rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. The company reported a narrow revenue beat and a 1-cent loss vs. expectations for a 2-cent loss.Office supplies brand Avery Dennison (AVY) filed a 9% advance, outpacing analysts' fourth-quarter revenue and earnings estimates and guiding full-year earnings above consensus forecasts. The gain left Avery just above a 79.37 buy point in a five-month cup base.Nvidia (NVDA) bolted 4% higher in weak trade, continuing further up the right side of a five-week consolidation.Managed care provider Anthem (ANTM) grabbed a 4% gain in heavy trade. Fourth-quarter earnings and revenue easily topped analysts' targets, and patient enrollment growth was stronger-than-expected.Among IBD 50 stocks, Aetna (AET), Facebook and Ellie Mae (ELLI) all booked gains of better than 2%. Among those three, only Facebook was near a buy point — less than 3% above a 129.37 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Other than Facebook, today's A-list after hours reporting schedule includes results from NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Tractor Supply (TSCO), Weatherford International (WFT) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS), among others.RELATED:Facebook, Symantec, Cavium, Apple Chip Suppliers' Earnings After The CloseApple Stock Hits 18-Month High, Scores Slew Of Price Target Hikes

204,AET,"If the House wins its ObamaCare lawsuit, the ruling would be an unprecedented rebuke of a president for brazenly usurping the power of the purse that the Constitution entrusts to Congress.But the celebration may not last long, because the GOP may be in for a shocker: Eliminating $130 billion or so in unappropriated funds that the Obama administration has carved out for ObamaCare may significantly increase the cost of the law.That's the surprising conclusion of a new Urban Institute study which finds that total ObamaCare costs will rise by $47 billion over 10 years if a court ruling nixes the spending program which compensates insurers for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs charged to low-income policy holders.Yet the study's authors ignore the political ramifications of such an increase in costs, which would come about only if the Obama administration (or the Clinton administration, perhaps following a 2017 Supreme Court ruling) rewrites regulations to permit a dramatic change in the way premiums are priced.It strains belief to imagine that Republicans would sit idly by as a Democratic administration effectively boosts spending by about $175 billion by executive fiat. Such a move would seem almost guaranteed to set off a heated budget showdown, with the GOP threatening to withhold funds from other programs near and dear to Democrats.Gaming out the chain of events that would follow a ruling in favor of the House is much more than idle speculation. As University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley, a reliable ObamaCare supporter, writes in a new paper, ""the president appears to have broken the law.""The legal question over funding of ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies is straightforward, so the only real question in the case is whether the House has standing to sue. That would be a first, but the case itself is unprecedented: The Obama administration unilaterally decided to appropriate $10 billion-plus a year — not as a one-time thing, but on a permanent basis.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer already decided that the House has standing, so it is virtually certain that she will rule against the Obama administration, likely in the first half of 2016. The White House will surely appeal and seek a stay of her ruling, which could push the endgame into 2017.  But the verdict will pose a serious threat to the health of the ObamaCare exchanges — and to insurer profits — at a time that UnitedHealth (UNH) is thinking about exiting the business and Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) have been struggling to earn a profit.To understand why the future of ObamaCare's exchanges could be seriously hurt by the outcome of the House lawsuit, consider what these cost-sharing subsidies mean to an individual earning 200% of the poverty level, about $23,500 a year. The cheapest silver plan in Houston comes with a $2,000 deductible and caps a plan member's cost for medical expenses at $6,850, after which the insurer pays all bills. But for lower earners, the insurer reduces the deductible to $450 and puts a $2,250 limit on out-of-pocket costs.You might say that the cost-sharing subsidies put the ""affordable"" in Affordable Care Act. But even if government funding of these subsidies is eliminated, insurers must still provide the same cost-sharing breaks to lower earners under the 2010 law.The logical way for insurers to make up for the loss of government funding for the cost-sharing subsidies is to charge higher premiums. But if insurers spread this expense across all plan levels, people who don't qualify for the subsidies would, in effect, have to pay a surtax for the cost-sharing benefits that go to someone else.""This would be a strong disincentive for individuals to enroll"" in exchange plans, write the Urban Institute's Linda Blumberg and Matthew Buettgens.Not only would the higher premiums dissuade people who don't get subsidies from signing up, but insurers who only offer individual-market policies off the subsidized ObamaCare exchanges wouldn't have to charge a surtax, giving them a competitive edge. Under that scenario, ObamaCare's problems with a narrow, high-cost insured pool will only get worse.The best solution for insurers and customers alike, the authors reasonably conclude, would be to charge a surtax only on silver plans. Since the cost-sharing subsidies only come with silver plans, people who don't qualify could still buy bronze or gold without paying extra. Further, because the size of premium subsidies is based on the cost of silver plans, and silver-plan premiums would jump by about 29%, the value of premium subsidies also would soar.This approach would produce some odd consequences, to say the least. Silver plans would become more expensive than gold plans, even though gold plans provide a much higher level of benefits. Because subsidies would be much bigger, many more people could get bronze plans for free, so more people would buy coverage and fewer would pay the mandate fine.Meanwhile, many people who now take advantage of the cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid directly to insurance companies, could instead opt for bronze coverage and reap a windfall in refundable premium tax credits. A 64-year-old couple earning just under $24,000 could get bronze coverage for free and an extra $8,000 tax credit to do with as they please.If the GOP wins their suit, as seems likely, the strategy mapped out by the Urban Institute could, in theory, be a boon to ObamaCare. But there's no chance that a Republican president would consider it, and it's likely to escalate the partisan war over ObamaCare.
"
205,AET,"The ObamaCare exchanges have added so few customers in the past three weeks that it almost seems like there must be some kind of glitch. With less than three weeks left to enroll, the exchanges still have fewer customers than signed up in 2015, yet the rate of new sign-ups now appears to be slower than it has been since the glitch-filled launch in the fourth quarter of 2013.That's worrying news for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). Without an infusion of fresh blood during this final sprint, the exchanges will tilt a bit older and not much bigger than 2015's make-up that prompted double-digit premium hikes and UnitedHealth's threat to exit the exchanges if losses don't end.It's also troubling for ObamaCare's supporters who have hoped that a jump in the individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695 for going without coverage in 2016, more than double 2015's minimum hit, would result in a big increase in enrollment rather than a big jump in the tax penalty millions of people will have to pay. Since there's no glitch holding down enrollment as the individual mandate penalty spikes, the problem must be in the marketability of the plans.Just 74,000 Sign-Ups Last WeekIn the past week, HealthCare.gov, which handles operations for 38 states, added just 74,000 customers, or less than half the 163,000 customers added in the same week a year ago.In fact the totals in each of the past three weeks are the three slowest weeks since the Obama administration began breaking out weekly HealthCare.gov totals at the start of 2015 enrollment. The three-week total of 231,800 new sign-ups is likely the worst stretch since late 2013 because the weakest month since then (February 2014) still saw close to 700,000 sign-ups.So far there's no hint that activity is accelerating as the clock winds down on 2016 open enrollment. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made no mention of a pick-up in her statement announcing the latest figures, referring only to a burst of activity in mid-December. One leading indicator of sign-up activity also has lagged. Over the past two weeks, 451,000 customers submitted applications, a necessary precursor to selecting an exchange plan. That's down by nearly one-fourth from the 579,000 application filers in the same period a year earlier.The drop in applications provides confirmation that sign-up activity is genuinely slow, rather than just an illusory effect of a shift in accounting for plan cancellations. Like last year, the HealthCare.gov states are subtracting customers when people cancel their plans, and each week's total represents the net addition of customers.In addition, insurers in HealthCare.gov states will strip out customers who never pay as their deadlines for monthly payments pass, rather than waiting until the end of open enrollment to do so.An example of what that culling of nonpaying customers looks like comes from Rhode Island, which operates its own exchange. This week, the state reported 30,015 paying and nonpaying customers, down 15.3% from the prior week's 34,627.There's no indication of any similar purging of nonpayers in the HealthCare.gov states. Two states did report that their sign-up totals edged lower last week. Montana sign-ups fell by 78, or 0.1%, from 55,555, and Pennsylvania's slipped by 1,239, or 0.3%, from 412,914. It's not clear whether those mild declines are just related to stripping out plans actively cancelled by consumers or whether an insurer here or there has started to winnow nonpayers.Aetna, Humana Signal Enrollment WeakFurther suggestions ObamaCare enrollment is weak have come from Aetna and Humana (HUM) recently. This week, Aetna told investors that its first-quarter individual market enrollment will be at least as high as at the end of 2015. That's a pretty low bar considering that Aetna's exchange enrollment shrank by more than 100,000, or 11%, in the third quarter as customers dropped coverage and likely continued to fall in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Humana reported that its individual enrollment will shrink by 200,000 to 300,000 by the end of 2016. (Aetna has agreed to buy Humana, but regulators have yet to approve it.)While Medicaid insurers such as Centene (CNC) that have been more aggressive in pricing premiums lower may be stealing customers from the competition — often with high deductibles — the size of the pie is likely to be smaller than companies were expecting.In 2015, 11.7 million sign-ups dwindled to 10.2 million paying customers by March and likely fewer than 9 million by year-end. The Obama administration's estimate of 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016, which had seemed shockingly low compared to the Congressional Budget Office's projected annual average of 20 million paid enrollees, now looks on the money and possibly optimistic.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.Related:ObamaCare Employer Mandate Is Worse Than Feared.

While ObamaCare…
"
209,AET,"The Obama administration has shifted expectations about ObamaCare to such an extent that the latest enrollment data were, quite remarkably, reported as good news.Yet the best measure of how well ObamaCare is providing affordable care to the broad group that the exchanges were meant to help should ring alarm bells.Many journalists and policy analysts seem to be grading on a curve, perhaps thinking that ObamaCare has earned goodwill by making insurance affordable for the very-near-poor and many with pre-existing conditions who previously had to pay an arm and a leg for coverage.That attitude would be reasonable if ObamaCare was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. But ObamaCare is a mandate for millions of modest-income people to buy unaffordable coverage or pay a penalty. There's a reason why the uninsured disapprove of the law by an overwhelming 2-to-1 margin: To paraphrase Jimmy Stewart, they know the difference between a blessing and a punch in the nose.Enrollment Dived In Late 2015One metric that's yet to be reported is what happened to enrollment in the final quarter of 2015, but the indications are that it continued to sink by 5% or more.Consider that HealthCare.gov ended 2014 with 4.3 million customers and re-enrolled 4.2 million of them. If customers don't actively renew their insurance or select another option, they get renewed automatically, unless they actively opt out, which almost no one did a year ago. Yet this year, of 9.3 million customers nationwide who were enrolled at the end of the third quarter, only 8.2 million re-enrolled.Now that doesn't mean that close to 1 million ObamaCare customers bolted in the fourth quarter. New York moved customers from 139% to 200% of the poverty level to a new public plan, and a handful of other states are still moving people into other coverage whose nonprofit co-op plans were shut down. Still, it seems clear that the number of people with exchange coverage shrank by at least 500,000 in Q4 to 8.8 million or fewer.Big insurers like Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Molina Health (MOH) reported an average 8% drop in exchange customers in the third quarter. Then, in November, UnitedHealth (UNH) warned that it might get out of the exchange business in 2017, in part because it has seen people rack up big health bills and then stop paying their premiums.'New Enrollees' = 'The Usual Suspects'One amusing spin from the Obama administration is that the new group of enrollees — those who didn't re-enroll — is younger than the new group who signed up last year at the same point. But ""new enrollees"" includes anyone who previously dropped coverage before November. Enrollment sank by nearly 3 million from the 11.7 million total that signed up for 2015, so there is a big pool of young, uninsured former customers that ObamaCare is trying to woo back with the threat of an individual mandate penalty of $695-plus.A case in point comes from Abby Goodnough of the New York Times, who reported on a California couple who dropped coverage. The man, age 37, plans to stay uninsured and pay the fine, but his 26-year-old wife will sign up because she's now thinking about having a baby.Total signups through the first week in January are still about 300,000 below last year's 11.7 million final total, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net. If, say, one-third of the ""new"" signups are past dropouts, then the actual pace of new enrollment is running way behind last year's pace. The upshot is that demand appears tepid and the final signup total may not even break 13.5 million, a far cry from the 20 million annual average projected by the Congressional Budget Office.Of course, paying customers mean a lot more than signups. If past is prologue, a couple of million people will never pay or drop coverage for a variety of reasons as the year progresses, and many more people will be left with policies that do little to make care affordable.A Bigger Bronze TrapOne thing that's clear from the latest enrollment period is that those who sign up close to the wire are much more likely to choose bronze plans — 29% of HealthCare.gov signups did in last year's final month vs. 19% in the first two months. That makes sense, because people who drag their feet but sign up to avoid paying a fine are more likely to opt for the cheapest plan available.Thus, the bronze share of plan selections is sure to rise over the next month, yet bronze is already more popular among HealthCare.gov signups this year than it was in the first two months of enrollment a year ago: 21% have opted for bronze vs. 19% at the same point.This is a concern because even among those earning above 300% of the poverty level (just over $35,000 for a single), relatively few are in a position to handle bronze-plan deductibles of up to $6,850 this year. But it's a huge concern when a sizable share of lower earners opts for bronze, and it looks like more will do so this year.ObamaCare made a priority of limiting out-of-pocket medical spending for those with incomes of up to 250% of the poverty level, so that they wouldn't face a pileup of medical debt or avoid getting necessary care at the risk of worse health outcomes. That's why the law provides both premium subsidies and an extra slice of cost-sharing subsidies for households in this income range.But because Democrats were so focused on limiting unmanageable out-of-pocket costs, the law's crafters linked the extra cost-sharing subsidies exclusively to silver plans as an extra incentive for modest-income individuals to buy comprehensive coverage. Those who buy cheaper bronze plans lose out on the extra subsidies.In this signup period, like last year's, 20% to 25% of those who would be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies — based on their low income if they bought silver — have instead selected bronze. (Both years' data are missing some income information, so exact numbers aren't available.)The bigger problem is this: Not only are many low-income enrollees choosing bronze coverage that may not help them much in a pinch, but millions of low-income households are steering clear of the exchanges because all of their options are bad. On top of that, due to ObamaCare employer rules, a few million modest-wage, full-time workers are ineligible for the subsidies — even if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.The bottom line is that even in the modest-income group from 150% to 250% of the poverty level, ObamaCare isn't helping a wide majority of people who surely could use help, but it may cost them $695 if they don't sign up.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

211,AET,"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday that 8.25 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov.Despite the upbeat tone after a last-minute rush led officials to push back the Dec. 15 deadline by a few days, the total so far trails the 8.8 million who signed up during open enrollment for 2015 coverage.At this point a year ago, HealthCare.gov sign-ups already had eclipsed its first-year total, so the news may be a sign that there's no great untapped ObamaCare demand. HHS touted 2.4 million ""new"" enrollees, but that includes people who previously signed up and dropped their plans.When the Obama administration projected that national enrollment would end 2016 at 11.4 million — at best — most analysts figured the estimate was intentionally way too low. Yet that's beginning to look plausible. Certainly, the Congressional Budget Office estimate of 21 million exchange enrollees in 2016 looks divorced from reality.Only 5.8 million people of the 7.2 million who held policies in June renewed coverage via HealthCare.gov, which operates exchanges for 37 states. An apparent auto-renewal snag means that this figure will rise slightly.Bad News For Insurers?People are automatically renewed if they don't visit the exchanges to select a plan. Though data from the other 13 states and D.C. haven't yet been compiled, the implication is that national enrollment in 2015 plans dived between June and December to roughly 9 million, down nearly one-fourth from the 11.7 million initial sign-ups. Big insurers, including Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH), reported losing an average 8% of exchange members in Q3.Tuesday's news may not be a great sign for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money in their ObamaCare exchange business. While the jump in 2016 premiums and deductibles will make a difference in insurer bottom lines, making plans less affordable may be taking a toll on consumer demand.UnitedHealth warned that it would exit the exchanges after 2016 unless things turned around. So far, at least, there's no clear evidence of a turnaround.Even the same kind of surge in January and February as last year would only put sign-ups roughly in line with HHS' modest target.Bronze Age, ContinuedHHS predicted that national sign-ups could rise as high as 14.1 million but end the year nearly 20% lower as people drop out, either because they get coverage from another source (employer, Medicaid or Medicare) or go uninsured.Another datapoint may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the sign-up rush is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's key when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since they qualify for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The catch is that the extra subsidies are only available to those who buy silver plans.For a 30-year-old couple in Richmond, Va., earning 200% of the poverty level ($40,000 for a family of three), buying a silver plan cuts their family deductible to $1,500, while the cheapest bronze plan has a $12,900 deductible. Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze as the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills. If a hospital trip could still torpedo their finances, does it really count as a success if the couple pays $1,000 for a bronze plan so that they don't have to pay a combined $1,390 fine?The Kaiser Family Foundation says 3.5 million uninsured could buy 2016 bronze coverage for less than the mandate penalty.

"
222,AET,"The reality is that the program, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse. Take single 27-year-olds in St. Louis earning $24,000, whose cheapest option is a $1,000 bronze plan with a $6,850 deductible. In other words, they can pay a fine equal to 3% of their income or spend 4% of income on a plan that will be of little use.
"
223,AET,"ObamaCare has succeeded in making health care much more accessible to people whose health conditions make them desperate for comprehensive policies to limit high out-of-pocket costs and for people with income below 150% of the poverty level for whom subsidies are especially generous. But most people with income above that level aren't being served well by the exchanges.
"
224,AET,"An Urban Institute analysis estimated that just 35% of people eligible for exchange subsidies had purchased plans. Yet the reality may be even worse for two reasons: The figure includes low-income people who settled for bronze plans and it excludes some 3 million uninsured who would be eligible for subsidies based on income but work full-time for companies that offer ""affordable"" coverage.
"
225,AET,"Those low-wage, full-time workers get the worst deal from ObamaCare. For example, in 2015, workers earning $17,500 a year — and their spouses — were ineligible for subsidies if their employer offered them bronze-type coverage for no more than $1,670. That's 15 times the $9 per month a bronze plan would cost via the subsidized exchanges.
"
226,AET,"When you include low-income uninsured workers with an offer of employer care, only about 1 in 4 with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level got silver coverage in 2015 that would protect their finances if they landed in the hospital.

Take single 27-year-olds in St. Louis earning $24,000, whose cheapest option is a $1,000 bronze plan with a $6,850 deductible. In other words, they can pay a fine equal to 3% of their income or spend 4% of income on a plan that will be of little use.ObamaCare has succeeded in making health care much more accessible to people whose health conditions make them desperate for comprehensive policies to limit high out-of-pocket costs and for people with income below 150% of the poverty level for whom subsidies are especially generous. But most people with income above that level aren't being served well by the exchanges.An Urban Institute analysis estimated that just 35% of people eligible for exchange subsidies had purchased plans. Yet the reality may be even worse for two reasons: The figure includes low-income people who settled for bronze plans and it excludes some 3 million uninsured who would be eligible for subsidies based on income but work full-time for companies that offer ""affordable"" coverage.Those low-wage, full-time workers get the worst deal from ObamaCare. For example, in 2015, workers earning $17,500 a year — and their spouses — were ineligible for subsidies if their employer offered them bronze-type coverage for no more than $1,670. That's 15 times the $9 per month a bronze plan would cost via the subsidized exchanges.When you include low-income uninsured workers with an offer of employer care, only about 1 in 4 with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level got silver coverage in 2015 that would protect their finances if they landed in the hospital. Even if enrollment jumps in 2016, it's not clear how much the 75% with no coverage or bronze plans will decrease.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

257,AET,"The backlash over ObamaCare deductibles will only intensify as customers shopping for 2017 plans a year from now face bronze-plan deductibles as high as $7,150.The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday detailed many key ObamaCare parameters for 2017, including a $300, or 4.4%, rise in the maximum out-of-pocket expense for covered medical bills — not including premium payments — from $6,850 in 2016.Some of the lowest-cost bronze plans for 2016 are setting deductibles and out-of-pocket limits at the $6,850 ceiling to hold down premiums, which still rose by about 12% over 2015, on average.That means that landing in the hospital could wreck the finances of many modest-income bronze plan enrollees.Aetna (AET) offers the cheapest bronze plan in St. Louis with a $6,850 deductible via its Coventry unit. Ambetter, affiliated with Centene (CNC), has the lowest-priced bronze in numerous markets such as Miami and Atlanta with a $6,800 deductible.UnitedHealth (UNH) roiled Aetna, Centene as well as other medical services stocks Thursday by warning it may exit the ObamaCare exchanges after 2016. UnitedHealth expects to continue losing money on such plans, even with deductibles rising and, in many markets, significant increases in premiums.The 2010 health reform law specifies that the maximum out-of-pocket cost will rise each year in tandem with the national average growth in premiums. The Obama administration only factors in the change in employer premiums.Employer penalties are indexed according to the same procedure, which means that companies will face a penalty of $2,260 per full-time worker in 2017 (with an exemption for 30 workers), up from $2,160 in 2016, if they fail to offer health coverage that meets ObamaCare standards.Unlike wages, employer fines are paid out of after-tax profits, so the $2,260 fine really equates to $3,711 in taxable wages, or $1.78 an hour for a full-time, year-round worker.In 2017, these key parameters will both be about 13% higher than their 2014 levels, with the maximum deductible rising to $7,150 from $6,350. The employer fine is up to $2,260 from $2,000, though the penalty was delayed until 2015.A long list of employers has limited work hours to dodge the fine while avoiding the cost of providing health benefits for some modest-wage workers.Still, the impact of the employer mandate has been more muted than the law's critics expected, but that's largely because low-wage, full-time workers are turning down employer coverage they find unaffordable.In 2017, as long as employers offer workers coverage that doesn't exceed 9.69% of pay — $1,938 for a $20,000-earner — they face no penalty under ObamaCare and the worker is ineligible for exchange subsidies. As a result, millions of low-wage workers remain uninsured because they can't access ObamaCare subsidies.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

258,AET,"UnitedHealth (UNH) is nearly out of patience with ObamaCare's individual market exchanges, warning Thursday that it may get soaked again in 2016. The outlook for other big insurers like Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) has gotten increasingly cloudy, with the forecast not clearing until 2017 or perhaps 2018.
"
259,AET,"But that may be optimistic because another huge, red-ink-imperiling curveball could come this spring with a ruling in House v. Burwell. Nearly 20% of total exchange subsidies paid out to insurers — or $136 billion over the next decade, by Congressional Budget Office estimates — is at stake.The House GOP's lawsuit against the Obama administration threatens the cost-sharing subsidies that turn silver plans to platinum for low-income exchange customers, dramatically shrinking their deductibles and out-of-pocket payments.The Affordable Care Act clearly requires insurers to provide these enhanced benefits to those who qualify based on income, and it directs the government to compensate insurers for those benefits. The problem is that, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has said, ""unlike the refundable (premium) tax credits, these payments to health plans do not appear to be funded through a permanent appropriation.""Initially, the Obama administration agreed, as evidenced by its $4 billion appropriation request for 2014 to pay out these cost-sharing subsidies. Yet, doubting that the House would go along, the Department of Health and Human Services reversed course and insisted that no annual appropriation was needed.The House voted to sue the Obama administration to protect its power of the purse and its lawsuit already cleared one huge hurdle. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled in September that the House has standing to sue in an opinion that strongly suggested she's likely to rule for the House on the merits.A decision is likely in the spring — around the time that insurers are figuring out where to set premiums in 2017.""If Judge Collyer rules that insurers cannot be reimbursed for the cost-sharing reductions they are required to provide . . . insurers would face substantial costs which are not covered by premiums,"" Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost wrote for Health Affairs. ""This could introduce serious instability into insurance markets.""Insurers would have to raise premiums to cover the cost-sharing reductions, perhaps by double-digits in many markets. That, in turn, could drive more relatively young and healthy customers out of markets in which the average customer is already ringing up higher costs than expected.There's also another potential problem. Insurers who sell ObamaCare-compliant policies both on and off the exchange have to offer the same price for the same coverage. But if the cost of exchange coverage spikes to make up for the loss of cost-sharing subsidies, insurers who exit the exchange may find a significant pricing advantage in selling off the exchange to higher-income customers who don't qualify for subsidies.In short, it may be clear by spring that the individual insurance exchanges, which are already failing to deliver for insurers and — more importantly — for a large majority of the modest-income uninsured population, won't have much of a future unless Congress and the next president can agree on a new path forward.While Judge Collyer won't have the final say — the case is likely to get to the Supreme Court — the merits of the case are far stronger than those of the recent King v. Burwell case in which conservatives argued that Congress intended to deny subsidies to states that didn't set up their own exchanges.The Government Accountability Office notes in its ""Principles of Federal Appropriations Law"" reference book that ""a direction to pay without a designation of the source of funds is not an appropriation.""Interestingly, the GAO included a new example to demonstrate the point: ObamaCare's risk-corridors program, which left insurers on the hook for some $2.5 billion in 2014 losses that the government was supposed to recoup.The statute ""directing HHS to make payments to qualified health plans did not, by its terms, enact an appropriation to make those payments.""

We as consumers are seeing the least desirable 'silver' plans increase rates by 7.5% on avg while the better plans are seeing increases of more than 10%, with higher deductibles and higher co-pays.........and just like ECON 101 taught you.....higher costs discourage buyers (in this case HEALTHY buyers) , which then only drives the costs even higher because the remaining consumers are sicker and need more healthcare....it's a vicious circle.....known as the 'death spiral'.....Now Republicans were quick  to jump on the bandwagon saying that ""Premiums are up and healthcare is more expensive...the consequences we see from this hastily and conceived legislation were entirely foreseeable and not at all surprising"" .....and as you expected the Democrats - led by Obama were quick to point out that the 'law is working well'.......Hmmm.....Well boys....you can't have it both ways - so which is it....is the ACA  working or not?  By the sounds of it.....CEO Helmsley clearly has a view......maybe the Democrats  need to talk to the insurers and see why the Doctor is NOT in......And in another move by the healthcare industry.....yesterday brought us news that Pfizer (PFE) is pressing ahead in its fight to save on corporate taxes by getting in bed with Ireland based Allergan (AGN)......putting the gov't and the company on a 'collision course' in what is known as the 'inversion trade'.......and here the Democrats want to prevent a company from 'strategically relocating' to take advantage of a broken US corp tax structure by piling on more regulations and red tape  while the Republicans say that the real problem here is the ""Broken US Corp Tax Structure"" as they call for a complete overhaul of the tax code - thereby eliminating the need or incentive to invert....Now back to the mkts......the broader mkt showed a lack of direction yesterday after Wednesday's surge......causing the S&P to tease both sides of the unchanged at least 25 times....the lack of any real significant change came as traders/investor took a breath.  The technical underpinnings of the mkt continue to argue that only a few companies continue to dominate the major indexes, while so many continue to drag....While the biggest companies with the largest capitalizations have pushed the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closer to their annual highs.....the broader indexes like the Wilshire 5000 and the Russell 2000 are still struggling.(The Wilshire 5000 - a total mkt index that measure the performance of all US stocks with 'readily available price data'.  But most people do not follow or even know what the Wilshire 5000 is.....because the media only talks about the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq, which are heavily weighted with large cap companies....that the average investors knows....  In fact the Wilshire 5000 is a much truer measure of the real health of the US economy as a whole.... I'm just sayin....) From a short term basis, the market is trying to work off last week’s sharp selloff and so far it appears to be doing just that......We need to continue to watch what crude oil prices do....Crude is now trading at $41/barrel....it needs to hold here.... A rally in oil will certainly help support the mkt but that is still a difficult call given the fundamentals and the strengthening dollar.....but it IS in a short-term oversold condition - so a bounce would not be out of the question......causing bargain hunters to go on a shopping spree.Overnight - the Asian mkts finished the week strong... Japan +0.1%, Hong Kong + 1.13%, China + 0.37% and ASX +0.26%. In Europe - mkts are churning.....even as Draghi hints at more stimulus......The Mali hostage crisis this morning is raising concerns over global security..... causing the focus to once again turn to ISIS and the recent events in France.  In the end - the mkts need to digest the action of late as we move into the weekend.  FTSE +0.12%, CAC 40 -0.13%, DAX +0.3%, EUROSTOXX -0.01%, SPAIN -0.5% AND ITALY -0.6%.  US Futures are pointing higher.....currently +5 pts.....but keeping us still within the 2065/2100 trading range.  We will get another load of FED speakers today.....St Louis FED Pres Bullard and NY's Dudley - both speaking on the economy......and you can believe that they will hammer home the message of 'normalization' coming to a theater near you in December.  On the eco front - look for reports form the Kansas City FED......survey says 0.  Take good care    KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

270,AET,"The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver-plan deductibles and results in smaller government subsidies.
"
271,AET,"This is likely good news for Centene (CNC), which could see big enrollment gains in 2016 because its Ambetter affiliate managed to significantly underprice competitors in a number of major markets by attaching deductibles as high as $6,500 to silver plans. But it's bad news for modest- to moderate-income customers buying coverage in some Ambetter markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., which will face the highest after-subsidy premiums in the country in 2016.
"
272,AET,"Many Bronze Premiums Spike
"
273,AET,"The cheapest bronze plan available in 2016 in those three cities will cost about $2,220, or $185 a month, for 27-year-olds earning about $30,000, just over 250% of the poverty level. That's 21% more than the average $152-per-month cost of the cheapest bronze plan found by IBD in a review of the largest market in each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov.
"
274,AET,"Paying the individual mandate penalty of $695 — less than one-third of the cost of the cheapest, $6,800-deductible bronze plan in those Centene-Ambetter markets — may look like the best option.
"
275,AET,"Although ObamaCare is already struggling to attract relatively young and healthy customers, and Centene's pricing strategy will make it even harder to do so, HHS said it has no plans to add new restrictions to the type of policies an insurer can offer.
"
276,AET,"While the Obama administration plans to create a standard silver plan that will have a $3,500 deductible, and it will aim to highlight that option for customers, that won't do anything to address the real threat: smaller subsidies.
"
277,AET,"Silver Deductibles Deduct From Subsidies
"
278,AET,"That's because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. Largely because two Ambetter plans are priced so low in its markets — with a $6,500 deductible for the cheapest silver plan and a $5,500 deductible for the second-lowest-cost plan — the subsidy available to 27-year-olds earning about $30,000 in Jackson will fall from $757 in 2015 to $439 in 2016.
"
279,AET,"The pricing shift in Jackson has been especially dramatic. In 2015, the second-lowest-cost silver plan cost 35% more than the cheapest bronze, but the gap has narrowed to just 13% in 2016.
"
280,AET,"One key reason is that Ambetter's cheapest silver plans cover only about 68% of eligible expenses of the insured group, not too far above the typical 60% covered by bronze plans. The standardized silver-plan option HHS envisions would cover 71% of group costs.
"
281,AET,"Centene also may be pricing in somewhat smaller bills among customers attracted by its lower-premium, high-deductible plans. Customers who choose Ambetter's $6,500 deductible plan in Indianapolis will get limited benefits before the deductible is met, such as primary-care visits at a cost of $30, specialist visits for $60 and generic drugs for $15, along with free preventative care such as vaccines. But big-ticket items like diagnostic testing, MRIs, specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren't covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.
"
282,AET,"Silver plans are the most common exchange selection because customers with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level are eligible for extra subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs.
"
283,AET,"Even with these extra cost-sharing subsidies, people earning from 201% to 250% of the poverty level would face a $4,500 deductible under the cheapest Ambetter silver plan.
"
284,AET,"After its $6.8 billion merger with HealthNet (HNT), Centene will have about 500,000 individual market customers in 14 markets.
"
285,AET,"Medicaid Insurers Expand In Exchanges
"
286,AET,"Along with Centene, Molina HealthCare (MOH), CareSource and other Medicaid managed care specialists have been among the most aggressive exchange competitors in terms of pricing. This group — not the start-up ObamaCare co-ops that are dropping like flies — looks likes the real threat to a profitable ObamaCare exchange presence for the biggest insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).
"
287,AET,"Last week, UnitedHealth shook up the entire sector with its warning that it may abandon the exchanges in 2017 if it keeps bleeding red ink in the coming year.
"
288,AET,"If it wanted to, the Obama administration could modify regulations to require silver plans to cover at least 70% of group costs, though it may be leery of taking steps that will lead to bigger premium hikes (before subsidies) in 2017, particularly since those will become evident by the time voters go to the polls in 2016.

"
299,AET,"The just-started enrollment period for ObamaCare exchange plans in 2016 is likely to yield one of two dismal outcomes. In the first, enrollment soars as people sign up in droves for the cheapest plan available to avoid the individual mandate tax penalty, whose minimum bite will spike from $325 to $695.
"
300,AET,"Although the law's strongest backers might celebrate this, it's not clear why: Millions of modest-income individuals who opt for bronze would get policies with deductibles as high as $6,850. Yet the Obama administration's own analysis reveals that among those still uninsured, 80% have less than $1,000 in savings.
"
301,AET,"Thus, landing in the hospital could torpedo the finances of many who buy bronze plans — exactly what ObamaCare was supposed to fix.

"
303,AET,"Penalty Better Than 'Coverage'?
"
304,AET,"HHS says that most exchange enrollees will be able to get coverage for no more than $900, meaning that it won't cost much more than the mandate penalty and for many it will cost less.
"
305,AET,"Why would people spurn coverage if the alternative is throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash? The jarring message would be that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for insurance — especially for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.
"
306,AET,"It's hard to imagine that the Democratic Party, which rails against income inequality, is prepared to tax away about 3% of pre-tax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage which may be of little use to them.
"
307,AET,"Consider the options for single 27-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, or just over 200% of the poverty level, who live in St. Louis.
"
308,AET,"The cheapest coverage available is the lowest-cost bronze plan from Coventry, a division of Aetna (AET), for $960. But 4% of income for someone of modest means is a lot to spend for a plan that won't cover much before the $6,850 deductible is met.
"
309,AET,"Keep in mind that after-subsidy premiums in St. Louis are close to the national average. A 27-year-old in Miami earning $24,000 would have to pay nearly $1,300 for the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter, which is affiliated with Centene (CNC).
"
310,AET,"ObamaCare also offers a catastrophic option, supposedly to make coverage more affordable for so-called young invincibles in their 20s. But the cheapest catastrophic plan in St. Louis, from Anthem (ANTM), would cost a 27-year-old just under $2,500.
"
311,AET,"The lowest-cost silver plan, from Cigna (CI), carries a more realistic $2,100 deductible but costs nearly $1,400. Yet coming up with $116 a month, or 5.8% of income, is no small thing for someone living more or less paycheck to paycheck. For these people, the $695 mandate penalty will itself be a big burden and might even help keep them uninsured in 2017.
"
312,AET,"This Isn't RomneyCare
"
313,AET,"Although the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.
"
314,AET,"ObamaCare silver plans provide extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket health expenses for those earning up to 250% of the poverty level. Yet, so far, most modest-income individuals are forgoing that extra support by choosing bronze or going uninsured.

316,AET,"The political left is crossing its fingers that people have yet to enroll because they either don't know about or don't understand the subsidies.
"
317,AET,"There's some truth to that. But ObamaCare is having trouble making the sale to millions of people who have kicked its tires. In the 2015 enrollment period, 11.7 million sign-ups in late February dwindled to 10.2 million paying members at the end of March, with the biggest drop among those who selected bronze. At least another 3 million people registered for coverage but never chose a plan.
"
318,AET,"HHS recently noted survey data showing that 60% of the uninsured are familiar with the mandate penalty. Among those who hadn't heard about it, only 30% said a penalty would make them more likely to get coverage.
"
319,AET,"While 12 million uninsured claimed exemptions from the mandate penalty, some 7.5 million people paid an average $200 penalty during tax time in 2015 for being uncovered in 2014.

Their results suggest that national enrollment has continued to sink from 9.9 million at the end of June to perhaps 9.5 million or lower at present. A drop below 9 million by year-end looks like a good bet based on the decline during last year's fourth quarter.
"
325,AET,"ACASignups.net, which compiled the data, noted that if national enrollment fell in Q3 at the same rate as it did for this group of insurers, it would have dropped to about 9.2 million at the end of September, but the actual decline was probably more modest. Charles Gaba, who runs the enrollment-tracking site, also posted data from a small sample of states that saw roughly flat enrollment in Q3, while exchange membership jumped in Massachusetts, which has no cut-off date for signing up.

Exchange customers at Centene (CNC) fell 7%, from 167,400 to 155,600. UnitedHealth Group saw a relatively tame decline of less than 2%, from about 550,000 to 540,000.
"
328,AET,"HealthNet (HNT) said its ObamaCare-plan customers fell from 350,000 to 334,000 in the quarter, a 4.6% decline, but that includes off-exchange customers, which make up about one-fourth of the total. Cigna (CI) saw individual market enrollment slip 3.6%, from 223,000 to 215,000, but it didn't disclose how many of those are in exchange, off-exchange or grandfathered plans.

329,AET,"Low enrollment is a concern for ObamaCare because the exchanges are having trouble getting enough young adults to balance out the risk of a customer base that has higher medical costs than expected.

334,AET,"ObamaCare's rules let many people skip their final payment of the year without consequence. Under ObamaCare's 90-day grace period, insurers must pay all claims for an enrollee for the first month after a payment due date is missed. For policyholders who aren't close to meeting their deductible, there isn't any risk in waiting to pay their December bill and doing so only if they have a costly medical emergency during the month.
"
335,AET,"The other factor that could lead people to take a free ride in December is that many of the low-cost policies on various state exchanges have seen significant price hikes, while other competitors have taken over as the lowest-cost provider. As a result, people shopping for bargains may consider switching plans and leaving their old provider in the lurch for December.

397,AET,"Anthem (ANTM) will announce a deal to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, or $187 a share as soon as Thursday, according to a variety of reports. Along with other mergers, the managed care industry on the road to shrinking to three giants from five today — if they pass antitrust musterCigna, which fell a fraction to 151.07 on Wednesday, rose to about 162 in after-hours trading as reports of an imminent deal came out. Cigna hit a record 170.68 on June 26.Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in many states, has been trying to buy Cigna for weeks. On June 20, it made a hostile bid of about $184. Apparently key questions over who would run the combined entity have been resolved.Anthem-Cigna would be larger than current No. 1, UnitedHealth Group (UNH).Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) reached a deal to buy Humana (HUM) for $35 billion earlier this month.There are other notable managed care firms. A day before the Aetna-Humana announcement, mid-sized insurers Centene (CNC) said it would acquire Health Net (HNT) for $6.3 billion.Still, the number of health insurance giants could fall to three — UnitedHealth, Anthem and Aetna — in the near future.That is, if antitrust regulators allow the takeovers to go forward. Investors aren't so sure. Humana is trading at a significant discount to Aetna's offer, while the spread has widened on the Centene-Health Net deal. Cigna's relatively modest rise late Wednesday also may indicate market doubt that the deals will get down.On the one hand, a handful of big insurers may have more market power to raise premiums or limit benefits. But they also could drive harder bargains with hospitals and drugmakers, helping consumers.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

407,AET,"As consolidation fever grips the managed care industry, Molina Healthcare (MOH) prefers to ""stick to our knitting,"" as chief financial officer John Molina likes to say.Its knitting since its founding in 1980 by Molina's father, David Molina, has revolved around the health care needs of low-income people who face barriers to care.Based in Long Beach, Calif., not far from where it was founded, Molina operates health plans in 11 states and Puerto Rico, most of them managed-care Medicaid programs for low-income and needy populations.If the pending merger of Centene (CNC) and Health Net (HNT) goes through, Molina would be ""the purest of the pure plays"" in Medicaid managed care and, more broadly, government-aided programs for low-income populations, Molina said in an interview with IBD.""We don't want to get into the broad commercial business. We don't want to take care of Medicare retirees who play golf three times a week,"" he said.Managed-Care MedicaidAs it happens, the managed-care Medicaid market is the fastest growing segment of the managed care industry, says Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne Agee CRT.""About 28% of all Medicaid expenditures are in managed-care Medicaid,"" he said. ""Our view is that this is a market that can triple from where it is (today).""Molina is benefiting from that growth as states shift Medicaid patients to managed care programs. It also has gained business from state exchanges under ObamaCare, covering the ""lowest income levels,"" says Wright.Molina's largest number of members are in California, Washington, Florida, Ohio and Texas.In April, Molina added Puerto Rico to its roster, covering around 350,000 members for more than 3.3 million in total. It's currently bidding for new business in Iowa and Georgia. But the company is also looking to grow in existing markets such as Florida and Texas.""We're hiring folks. We're expanding. At the same time, we're sticking to the core business dad put us into 35 years ago,"" Molina said.The company is still a family business of sorts. Molina's older brother, Mario Molina, is the CEO; his sister, Martha Molina Bernadett, is an executive vice president. Both are physicians. ""I went to law school and became the numbers guy,"" Molina said.Through various trusts, the Molina family owns a 25%-30% stake in the company, Molina says. The company went public in 2003.New contract wins and privatization of Medicaid programs will continue to drive Molina's top-line growth, says Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners.Revenue has grown around 26% on a compounded annual rate over the last two years. But growth has picked up sharply this year. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 53% over the earlier year to $3.2 billion. Enrollment grew 38% across all its health plans.Its Florida health plan alone added 185,000 federally subsidized exchange members in the quarter, resulting in a tripling of premium revenue over the prior year.Earnings per share in the quarter soared to 56 cents a share from 10 cents. Second-quarter results will be released on July 30.Economies Of ScaleAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Molina's revenue for all of 2015 will jump 49% over last year to $14.4 billion, slightly above Molina's forecast for $14.3 billion. They see earnings rising 99% to $2.59 per share.""We have the lowest (general and) administrative costs in the managed care industry,"" said Molina, noting that it's around 8% of revenue compared to the average 12% to 15%. The company forecasts a 7.6% ratio for the full year.Even though it's a relatively small managed-care player compared with UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which plans to acquire Humana (HUM), ""scale and critical mass give it leverage to improve fixed costs,"" Gupte said.Rather than drive costs down through a merger, Molina seems more intent on improving net profit margin to 2% from less than 1% by increasing revenue on its own. It raised around $400 million in a secondary equity offering in June and has since announced three small acquisitions for putting that capital to work.The three are in Florida, Michigan and Illinois, states where it already has business.Molina's scale in local markets is viewed as more crucial by some than scale across state borders. ""The benefits of scale (through mergers) have been greatly exaggerated in this industry,"" Wright said. ""You have to have local market share. There are plenty of quite successful (companies) of smaller scale such as Molina. It's growing nicely organically. I think it has enough scale in the Medicaid business in its major markets to compete quite effectively.""Analysts have speculated that Molina might indeed get swept up in merger mania, though. Much of the speculation has centered on a combination with WellCare Health Plans (WCG) . Molina wouldn't comment as a matter of policy.But Molina did offer an argument against a merger: ""There is a notion people have that being larger is beneficial. Medicaid is in some respects unique because it is one state at a time. You don't do Medicaid across three states at once, so economies of scale are a little different.""Wright doesn't rule out a potential merger. But he doesn't think Molina ""needs to be bought.""""I think there are plenty of people interested in buying it,"" he said. ""The question is, at what price? The issue with price is that people don't want to pay what its value will be three years down the line. Potential acquirers have vastly underappreciated the growth of the company and the Medicaid business in general.""

Revenue rose 7.3% to $21.5 billion, topping estimates of $20.9 billion.Benefits as a share of premiums rose to 87.2% from 87.0% a year ago, reflecting high costs among Iowa Medicaid customers and individual market policyholders.The insurer offered earnings guidance for 2017 of ""greater than $11.50"" per share vs. current estimates of $11.53.Anthem had about 1.7 million members with individual insurance policies in December out of a total of 39.9 million.

The company warned in early November that it wanted to see moves by Washington to strengthen those markets, or else it might bolt.Yet uncertainty about the future of the exchanges has grown as Republicans move toward repealing key features of ObamaCare, without any clarity on replacement.Meanwhile, Anthem is awaiting a judge's ruling on the fate of its $54 billion merger with Cigna (CI), which got a thumbs-down from the Justice Department under President Obama. A federal judge recently blocked the planned Aetna-Humana (HUM) merger, following DOJ objections.Despite major doubts that the merger will close, Anthem shares have surged since the election, helped partly by prospects for a big corporate tax cut. Anthem will have to pay Cigna a $1.8 billion break-up fee if the deal doesn't go through.RELATED:Aetna Plans Full ObamaCare Exit, Mulls Humana MoveUnitedHealth Earnings Beat As ObamaCare Exchange Costs ImproveTrump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

483,AET,"Aetna (AET) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, overcoming ObamaCare exchange losses, but offered guidance for 2017 that trailed analyst estimates.The insurer, which exited most but not all of its ObamaCare exchange markets at the end of 2016, says it will get out completely amid a disruptive political battle over their future.CEO Mark Betolini said he sees ""no possible way"" to set premiums for 2018 to meet regulatory deadlines ""given the unclear nature"" of how the exchanges will operate.The company also said it's still evaluating next steps in its proposed merger with Humana (HUM) after a federal judge rejected the $37 billion deal last week on antitrust grounds.Anthem (ANTM), whose lawsuit to salvage its proposed merger with Cigna (CI) will be ruled on soon, reports earnings before Wednesday's open.Estimates: Analysts expected Aetna to report a fourth-quarter profit of $1.44 per share, up 5.1% from a year ago, on a 5% rise in revenue to $15.841 billion.Results: The insurer easily topped profit estimates, earning $1.63 a share, helped by strong margins in its Medicare and Medicaid business, but fell a bit short of targets with revenue of $15.717 billion.Outlook: Full-year EPS of at least $8.55 vs. Wall Street views for $8.79, on revenue of $60 billion-$61 billion, below consensus for $62.225 billion.Aetna said revenue from individual and small group customers would fall by $4 billion and Medicaid contract losses would cut another $1.4 billion, with not-quite-offsetting gains from Medicare, Medicaid and its core commercial markets.Stock reaction: Aetna shares rose 1.6% to 118.61 on the stock market today. Anthem stock dipped 4 cents to 154.14. Cigna rose 0.4% and Humana fell 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under President Trump.Aetna shares initially surged after the election because it stands to benefit from corporate tax cuts and investors may have hoped a Trump administration would be more friendly to big corporate mergers.But analysts increasingly doubt that the Humana deal can be resurrected after a judge ruled it would reduce competition in Medicaid Advantage and ObamaCare exchange markets.The health care sector has underperformed during the Trump rally because of uncertainty over ObamaCare and drug pricing. Aetna said it expects its drug costs to rise in the low double-digits in 2017, reflecting both price increases and usage.RELATED:Apple, Aetna, Humana Downgraded; Comcast PT Raised Ahead Of Q4Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. Verizon sought an edge over T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. T-Mobile quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers.

"
487,AET,"ObamaCare was on the way to the emergency room and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election.The pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums are soaring as a result. The reason is simple: The law succeeded in making insurance affordable for older, higher-cost, and near-poor individuals, but has fallen far short of its promise for those who are relatively young, lower cost, working class and middle class.Those latter groups comprise some 24 million people who lack either employer or government coverage, and if TrumpCare were to give them a better deal, while preserving the protections afforded to the vulnerable, Democrats would have every reason to get on board.There is an exceedingly simple bipartisan formula for replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms with ""something terrific,"" in Donald Trump's words, at least relative to the status quo and to the GOP plans on the table.That formula, explained in further detail below, is this: Get rid of the heavy-handed mandates and give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic care and set aside funds in a Health Savings Account to cover basic medical needs.There's good reason to think that this is the only possible path to a bipartisan health care fix and that the political window for seizing this opportunity may quickly shut if not seized early in 2017. Unfortunately, the GOP is contemplating a repeal-now, fix-later strategy that, at worst, could blow up the individual health insurance market or, at best, let ObamaCare's problems fester for three years or more, hurting millions and millions of working-class and middle-class individuals and families that need — and in many cases voted for — a better deal.Keeping ObamaCare on life support for years while the GOP wracks its collective brain to come up with something terrific would require insurer ""bailouts"" — the Republicans' own term for it — that could exceed anything seen under President Obama. To keep insurers from bolting the troubled markets en masse after a repeal vote, Republicans would have to essentially guarantee that they'll at least break even after administrative expenses.Republicans would be attending to the bottom line of big insurers such as Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM) while ignoring the needs of 20-plus million people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare and would like to see that deal ripped up tomorrow.Before getting into the details of a replacement, let's take a moment to consider just who these 20-plus million people are who have nothing to gain and much to lose from repeal and delay.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.There are about 7 million people buying ObamaCare plans off the exchange, mostly because they earn too much to qualify for exchange subsidies. That's hardly fair treatment when nearly everybody else gets government subsidies to buy health insurance, either through the tax exclusion for employer-provided coverage or through a government program. On top of that, there are another 3 million with income above ObamaCare's 400% of poverty level cut-off for subsidies who remain uninsured and more than a million buying unsubsidized coverage through the exchanges. All of these people would stand to benefit from GOP proposals to offer a tax credit for everyone buying coverage in the non-employer market, but Republicans in Congress now say that such ideas may be put on ice, even as ObamaCare premiums are soaring, making coverage harder to attain.Another 4.5 million people are uninsured despite working full time and having an offer of employer coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These people have modest to moderate incomes that would qualify them for ObamaCare subsidies, but they — and their spouses — are ineligible as long as employer coverage doesn't cost more than about 9.7% of income. That means high-deductible bronze-level coverage can cost some full-timers five times or even upwards of 10 times what its costs someone at the same income level who is eligible for exchange subsidies (perhaps because they work two part-time jobs or at a smaller company not subject to ObamaCare's employer mandate).KFF estimates that there are another 5.3 million uninsured people who are eligible for subsidies but have spurned ObamaCare coverage, either because they see it as a bad deal — even with subsidies, if they buy coverage, and fines, if they don't — or perhaps aren't fully aware of their eligibility. The Urban Institute estimates this group is even larger, comprising 6.9 million people.Finally, there are 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary for states.That makes about 24 million Americans who have a huge stake in the GOP's coming decision, and that doesn't even include the 8 million-plus subsidized ObamaCare exchange customers who don't want to see their coverage disrupted or roughly 10 million gaining coverage via the Medicaid expansion.If Republicans stick to their repeal and delay strategy, experts warn that the individual insurance market could be thrown into crisis with far-reaching repercussions. While the GOP can conceivably avoid outright chaos in the individual market by protecting insurers' bottom lines, what will that achieve? They'll never get any Democratic votes needed to overcome a filibuster and there will likely never be a bridge to a strictly Republican vision of reform. To understand why, just consider this analysis showing that the same plan which costs a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $23,600) less than $1,000 under ObamaCare would cost the couple roughly $18,000 under the Empowering Patients First Act authored by Rep. Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Making coverage affordable for older, higher-cost, low-income patients isn't the problem with ObamaCare. The problem is that ObamaCare's rules stacked the deck in favor of comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly.Even among households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, a group that was supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of the law, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster, an IBD analysis of ObamaCare's effect on the working class has found.Consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare this year costs about $2,200, and carries a $1,000 deductible (and $4,500 out-of-pocket limit on top of premiums), but they're probably already struggling to save money and that may be too much of a financial stretch.Alternatively, this couple could buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support only to silver plans, effectively turning silver plans to platinum for modest-income beneficiaries while making bronze plans of questionable value. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement that merges Republican principles and Democratic values is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a comprehensive policy that limits their liability.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option: a high-deductible plan with a Health Savings Account on top. TrumpCare, unlike ObamaCare, could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings with two simple tweaks. ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young could be eased for high-deductible plans (without putting comprehensive plans out of reach of older adults), and cost-sharing subsidies could be used against bronze plan premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's premium to zero this year, and they'd have about $800 left in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses.While Democrats don't want modest-income households to opt for high-deductible plans that could sink their finances, having some coverage is better than none, as is all too common at present — despite ObamaCare's penalties for those who go uncovered. That's why families above 200% of the poverty level should be able to opt for catastrophic coverage — with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democratic senators. This approach, along with the tweaks noted above, could make coverage free for everyone up to about 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There's no reason why members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be denied a comparable level of help given to those who get coverage through the workplace. A logical way to do this would be giving a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. Further, full-time low-wage workers who can't afford the coverage offered at work and their spouses shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and those with lower incomes get Health Saving Account deposits on top, there's really no point in threatening them with penalties.Even for people above 250% of the poverty level, coverage would be a lot cheaper for the young adults who are the prime target of the individual mandate, so take-up would naturally increase. Still, to ensure a broad risk pool, TrumpCare should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach would very gradually and incrementally shrink tax subsidies for those above 250% of the poverty level based on how long they go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if the coverage provided by these separate high-risk pools is good and affordable (as it should be), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's one reason why it may make more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal. That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups insurer expenses of the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government for financial backing). Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. Public reinsurance is a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best, including an option for modest-income households to deposit subsidies in excess of premiums in a Health Savings Account. This approach, or something very close to it, is likely the only approach to replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms that can win bipartisan support, but the chance for seizing it may go quickly out the window if Republicans opt for repeal and put the replacement debate on hold.The reason why should be clear: Making sure that no one currently benefiting from ObamaCare is ""worse off"" and that the 20 million-plus who get a bad deal can get a better deal — the goal for replacing the law sketched out by Paul Ryan — will require some hard choices. That includes reforming the income-tax (though not payroll-tax) exclusion for employer-provided coverage as outlined above. There are other logical offsets as well to pay for what essentially would be a tax cut for millions of people without raising tax rates. But once the debate is poisoned by the consequences of repeal and delay on the individual market, and once Republicans move forward with the rest of their tax-cutting agenda, the opportunity will almost certainly be gone. At that point, as in President Bush's failed push for Social Security reform in 2005, Democrats will have a whole list of Trump tax cuts they'll want repealed before they begin to consider reforms that require any politically difficult trade-offs.

488,AET,"No industry faces more upheaval from the changing of the guard in the White House than the health sector, with Donald Trump pledging to sweep away ObamaCare, the defining policy effort of outgoing President Barack Obama.Yet, despite the uncertainty over whether up to 22 million people might lose coverage, health insurance stocks — with a few exceptions — have been among the big winners of the stock market's postelection rally.A few drivers of the rally are pretty obvious. Repeal of ObamaCare is expected to kill an insurance industry tax that cut the profit of industry leader UnitedHealth Group (UNH) by $1.85 billion in 2016. President Obama and Congress already passed a one-year moratorium of the tax for 2017.A Trump administration that may be less hostile to big business combinations could let Aetna (AET) complete its acquisition of Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM) close its deal to buy Cigna (CI). That latter deal could create the nation's largest health insurer, displacing UnitedHealth for the top spot in the number of insured.Still, UnitedHealth, though it's not the best sector performer since the election, is alone among major insurers in reaching an all-time high.""We see the next 10 years as holding even greater opportunity and growth than the last 10 years for this company,"" Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said at the company's recent Investor Day conference.UnitedHealth, which is No. 6 on the Fortune 500 list and still would tower over Anthem-Cigna based on revenue — an estimated $184 billion vs. $123 billion combined in 2016 — doesn't have to have the most clients to be the Amazon.com (AMZN) of health care, as it appears well on its way to becoming.No company is better situated to capitalize on the irrepressible growth in health care spending, aging demographics and the inevitable need to control costs, and those trends are far too powerful to be derailed by a change at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.""What has UnitedHealth standing apart from other insurers is Optum,"" its fast-growing, higher-margin, health-services division that will contribute more than 40% of company operating profit this year, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily.Optum, which is on pace to grow revenue by 22.8% to $83 billion for 2016, has three main parts: OptumInsight, a data-analytics division; OptumRx, its prescription benefit management business; and OptumHealth, which provides medical care via 20,000 physicians and more than 500 primary and urgent care centers.Like Amazon, UnitedHealth has become the leader in customer data analytics and personalization — though instead of suggesting other books you might like, Optum can provide proactive help filling gaps in care. That might include scheduling an overdue mammogram or signing up someone ordering a prescription for a long-term diabetes-management program.Also like Amazon, UnitedHealth has expanded horizontally, carving out new ground to better fulfill its customers' needs, such as through its fast-growing network of urgent care centers. Similarly, UnitedHealth's OptumInsight unit has opened up fast-growing markets selling its expertise, just like Amazon Web Services.""Optum, while participating in a contested market, has created a demand for its technologies and services,"" noted research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in naming Optum its 2016 company of the year in population health management. ""The company is equally versed to draw evidence from payers, providers, employers and consumers,"" informing its ""holistic health care approach.""IBD'S TAKE: Shares of UnitedHealth are extended after breaking above a buy point at 144.58 on Nov. 10. Visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock purchases and be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's underlying trend and what it means for investment decisions.All these elements, along with its mining of data derived from the 50 million people it covers and the 1 billion prescriptions it processes in a year, come together to let UnitedHealth deliver what executives like to say is ""the right care at the right place at the right time"" to achieve the best outcome while holding down costs.Despite political uncertainty over ObamaCare, Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick upgraded UnitedHealth to a buy rating this week following the company's Tuesday investor conference.""UnitedHealth made a compelling argument at its Investors Day that its balanced portfolio and growth, its innovative approaches and its commitment to fixing a broken health care system likely insulate it from downside due to political change,"" she wrote, seeing sustainable double-digit growth in earnings per share.OptumInsight CEO Bill Miller told investors that nearly 700 hospitals are using Optum analytics to predict outcomes and guide treatment for their patient populations, including more than 100 additional hospitals over the past year. Further, he said, 20 of the 25 top health plans have tapped Optum to improve their claims processing.UnitedHealth stubbed its toe with ObamaCare, piling up losses and beating a nearly full retreat from individual exchange business, but Loo sees that as being due to problems with the exchanges, rather than exposing a weakness of the company.While big coverage losses with the unwinding of ObamaCare could hurt UnitedHealth, which has benefited from the expansion of Medicaid coverage, Loo also sees potential upside from the GOP's election sweep. On one hand, efforts to rein in Medicaid could be a negative, but fiscal curbs also could lead more states to shift to Medicaid managed care. UnitedHealth told investors that it is starting five new Medicaid managed care contracts in 2017.Likewise, the GOP has always preferred Medicare Advantage to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, so there's a possibility of faster growth there. Hemsley preached his vision to investors — as the company does to policymakers in Washington — of fully shifting both Medicaid and Medicare to managed care.Such a strategy could reap savings for the government while giving UnitedHealth and other insurers a bigger cut of the government health-care pie. Currently, less than two-thirds of 72 million Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care programs, while about 30% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.UnitedHealth signaled to analysts that its insured base could drop by 1 million in the individual market — both on and off the exchanges — amid its pullback from ObamaCare, but that will be a tailwind for earnings in 2017 because the company has lost about $850 million on the exchanges this year.UnitedHealth shares started to break out in late October, retreated, and then surged in mid-November. Shares had been on a four-day rally but slowed to a crawl, and fell by 1.9% to close at 157.63 on Monday.

489,AET,"Aetna's (AET) attempt to assuage U.S. antitrust concerns about its $37 billion takeover of Humana (HUM) by selling certain assets to a smaller company landed with a resounding thud.The companies are trying to convince a federal judge that the Justice Department's rejection of the deal was wrong. A trial on the government's lawsuit started Monday in Washington.The firm Aetna wants to sell assets to, Molina Healthcare (MOH), is unlikely to replace the competition that would be lost from the merger, according a filing by the U.S. Molina was criticized by the government as a junk-rated company whose previous foray into the Medicare Advantage market flopped.""Today, the companies compete directly against one another,"" Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said in his opening statement. ""All this competition would be eliminated by the merger.""The Justice Department sued Humana and Aetna in July, the same day it filed a complaint seeking to halt Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion acquisition of Cigna (CI). The antitrust lawsuits are aimed at preventing the contraction of the national health insurance market to just a handful of players and protect competition in an industry that President Barack Obama reshaped with the 2010 Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.""Health insurance can mean the difference between life and death,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said when the lawsuits were filed. ""If the big five were to become the big three, not only would the bank accounts of American people suffer, but the American people themselves.""While the ACA was meant to make health insurance more accessible and more affordable to tens of millions of people who lacked coverage, the law has been beset by legal and political opposition. Enrollment has fallen short of estimates and financial losses have prompted some companies to withdraw from the market.Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna in August announced it would stop selling ObamaCare coverage in 11 of the 15 states in which it participated in the program, including all 17 of the Florida, Georgia and Missouri counties where the U.S. has claimed its merger with Humana would decrease competition.""Because Aetna no longer operates in the challenged counties, the merger will have no effect on market concentration or competition,"" the company said in a Nov. 23 filing with U.S. District Judge John Bates.The U.S. argues that Aetna's withdrawal was aimed at undermining the government's case and said that nothing prevents Aetna from re-entering those markets after sitting out a year.Aetna's acquisition of Humana would leave the carrier dominant in Medicare Advantage coverage for the elderly in 364 counties in 21 states, Justice Department lawyers argued.Aetna and Humana attorneys claim that Medicare Advantage operates in the same market as the government's Medicare program and therefore the combined company can't be dominant.""To be sure, there may be differences among original Medicare options and Medicare Advantage products, but such differences are not sufficient to support separate markets,"" the companies said in a filing.Aetna shares plunged 3% to close at 129.45 Monday. Humana fell 2.3% to 208.83. Anthem was off fractionally to 144.09 while Cigna was up nearly 1% to 134.70. UnitedHealth dropped 1.9% to 157.63.

Here's one plan to make sure TrumpCare is ""terrific."" 
"
495,AET,"There are a number of huge problems with Republicans repealing ObamaCare now but putting off a fix for several years as they figure out how to replace it.The first is that repeal without replace risks blowing up the already-ailing exchanges. The news that ObamaCare has been repealed, even if the fine print says the individual mandate penalties stay in force, will lead the young and healthy to abandon the exchanges in droves for the same reason that relatively few signed up in the first place: ObamaCare offers them a pretty unattractive deal.UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have already mostly exited the exchanges. If ObamaCare were repealed now but kept on life support while the GOP figures out how to replace it, other insurers like Anthem (ANTM) would be crazy to keep offering coverage — short of a government backstop that ensures they'll do no worse than break even. Without such a commitment, it's reasonable to expect huge swathes of the country to have zero insurers left on the subsidized exchanges, and Republicans would reap a backlash.What would happen then? The GOP would likely have to resort to what is effectively an emergency public option, with the government filling the void via Medicare or Medicaid — just as occurred in Massachusetts in 2014 because of that exchange's temporary technical glitches. Wouldn't it be ironic if ObamaCare repeal turns out to be a big step to single payer?While avoiding this disruptive scenario is critically important, that's hardly the only reason why it's essential to replace ObamaCare without delay. Even if Republicans can buy time by removing insurer risk, there's another huge reason to move forward without delay.Much of the reason is embedded in this first chart, which shows that ObamaCare hasn't only been a failure for middle-class households, which get little or no help buying coverage, but it's failing a wide majority of working-class households too.The chart shows that 2 in 3 members of the working class (with incomes from 150% to 250% of the poverty level) who lack coverage from other sources remain uninsured or, to a lesser extent, are getting bronze coverage that won't protect them from a devastating financial hit if they land in the hospital.Republicans were hired to replace ObamaCare with ""something terrific,"" as Donald Trump promised to do, not to kick the can and do nothing for far too many millions of people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare. And Republicans should remember something that Democrats too easily forgot: Millions of full-time low-wage workers get perhaps the worst deal of all from ObamaCare, since they are excluded from subsidies, but may still be subject to penalties.Also, don't forget about those 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that states must be able to opt out of the Medicaid expansion.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.These problems are far too urgent for Republicans to waste several years trying to come up with a plan that has eluded them for the nearly seven years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.The reality is that Republicans are not ready for prime time when it comes to health care. They have no actual plan to replace ObamaCare with either something that is terrific or even that comes close to Paul Ryan's pledge to leave no one ""worse off"" while giving most people a better deal.To see just how far the GOP is from keeping faith with Ryan's word, all you really have to do is look at one chart that exposes the weakest link in the Empowering Patients First plan put forward by Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The chart shows that a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $24,000) would have to pay about $18,000 a year for the same low-deductible coverage that costs less than $1,000 under ObamaCare.The reality is that Republicans are at a loss about how to proceed, but that doesn't provide a legitimate excuse for, at best, letting ObamaCare's very serious problems fester while the government soaks up insurer losses or, at worst, blowing apart the exchanges. Repeal and replace later is a bridge to nowhere.It should be clear that repealing without replacing ObamaCare will inflict great damage for no good reason. Republicans don't need moral victories. They're in power and need to show they can govern. So what is the GOP to do? Monday's piece will explain a surprisingly logical path to making TrumpCare terrific without an individual mandate — and without delay.RELATED:Trump, GOP Will Create New ObamaCare Winners, LosersWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart

The major indexes settled for pinched gains as volume rose.The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% at one point, closed up just 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 did a little better, rising 0.3%.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher after logging bigger gains earlier in the stock market today. The Russell 2000, still catching its breath after three straight weeks of huge gains, fell 0.1%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the Dow 30 components, soaring 3.6% to 157.59 and continuing its impressive rebound since resuming a rally past a 141.88 handle buy point on a nearly three-month base.The managed care giant issued strong earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 just after President-elect Donald Trump on Monday named Georgia Congressman Tom Price as his health and human services Cabinet secretary to oversee the federal government's Medicare and Medicaid programs. Price is reportedly known for his anti-ObamaCare policy stance.While UnitedHealth cannot equal the outstanding run that tech giant Apple (AAPL) made from its initial breakout in 2004 through its latest peak in 2015, in recent years the big-cap health care play has been a superb long-term performer.After the market's key follow-through on Sept. 1, 2010, UnitedHealth broke out of a fresh base at 33.89 and has since risen 365% — more than the 237% maximum gain achieved by Apple when it broke out that same month six years ago.The Street currently sees UnitedHealth's profit rising 24% to $8.01 this year and 14% to $9.14 in 2017.UnitedHealth weighs in at $150 billion in market value, a fraction of Apple at $594 billion. Yet UnitedHealth's proprietary IBD rankings, as seen in IBD's diagnostic tool Stock Checkup, are much stronger than its tech peer for now, including a group-leading 88 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 (vs. a 47 for Apple), an 83 for Relative Strength and a B+ for Accumulation/Distribution.An Accumulation grade of C+ or higher hints at net institutional buying in the stock over the past 13 weeks.UnitedHealth's recent rally is affirmed by solid moves in the Medical-Managed Care group.Aetna (AET) ran up nearly 3% to 132.03 on Tuesday, extending recent gains. The insurance giant is now up 8% past an 121.70 early buy point within a nearly five-month cup-like pattern. EPS growth is expected to accelerate in 2017 at 9% vs. a 4% jump expected this year.Humana (HUM), another fellow large cap play with a market value of $31.3 billion, rose 2% to 210 in fast trading and has gained 9.5% since surpassing a 191.75 entry within an unusual-looking four-month consolidation. The provider of health insurance to the military and civilian consumers sports an outstanding A+ Accumulation grade according to IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, other top stocks are still in bases. They include NetEase (NTES) and GrubHub (GRUB), ranked No. 9 and 10, respectively, in the current IBD 50. However, both stocks are swimming below their 50-day moving averages.A leading growth stock tends to break out after rising above its 50-day line, not trading below it. Such action indicates that the stock has been making stronger-than-usual price gains in the near term.NetEase began its new base after peaking at 272.58 and reversing lower on Oct. 14.GrubHub, the leader in online and mobile-based food ordering, has been working on the right side of a potential cup base since reversing lower in above-average turnover on Sept. 29.Both stocks show Composite Ratings of 90 or higher, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:UnitedHealth Sees Revenue Topping $184 Billion In 2017

499,AET,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has put payday loans in its cross hairs as it rewrites the rules for short-term loans that carry an interest rate in excess of 36%.Maybe it should investigate ObamaCare, which effectively charges more than 100% interest to members of the working class for accessing their own cash because they only see unaffordable options under the law and opt to remain uninsured.There were noble intentions behind the mandate as a cog in ObamaCare's machine for making coverage affordable and accessible to those who were priced out of it due to income or a pre-existing condition. Yet the reality of the coverage options and the way the law is administered have undermined those high-minded goals and often made income inequality worse.The individual mandate is looking like a failure in its goal to make coverage affordable by coaxing the relatively young and healthy to get coverage. Premiums for the cheapest HealthCare.gov bronze plans are set to spike 28% in 2017 to cover the costs of the exchange pool that is disproportionately old and unhealthy. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET), and Humana (HUM) are bailing out of most of the state exchanges where they do business this year. Now Anthem (ANTM), which runs Blue Cross Blue Shield in many states, says it may follow suit.This year, roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual-mandate penalties totaling more than $3 billion, even before the penalty jumped from a minimum $325 to at least $695 in the coming tax season. It's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual-mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Consider, by contrast, the perspective of diner cashier Wylene Gary of Yazoo City, Miss., who dropped her coverage in 2014 when she discovered it had a $6,000 deductible, enough to torpedo her finances if she landed in the hospital. ""This ain't worth a tooth,"" she told Kaiser Health News.Democratic politicians rail against income inequality. Yet they defend ObamaCare, when the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away something like 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.IBD'S TAKE: News that the Justice Department is investigating generic drug makers for price collusion is just the latest sign of the growing political risk facing the health care sector as cost growth ramps up again.Although ObamaCare's problems run much deeper, consider for a moment how the administration of the mandate penalty undermines the law and has a negative effect on the working class.The Obama administration likes to tout affordability by saying that most people eligible for subsidies can get a plan for $75 a month (or less). But paying around $900 a year for a bronze plan that carries deductibles as high as $7,150 in 2017 may seem like too much of a stretch for many.That first $75-a-month payment comes due in December 2016, while the penalty of $695 isn't paid until March or April 2018.The option of keeping your $75 a month is akin to letting ObamaCare be one's payday lender on a loan that averages $450 over the course of the year and charges $695 in interest.And like payday loans, people who have their finances sapped in this way are more likely to pay the mandate penalty again. That's because $75 a month may seem even less affordable the following December if they're about to have $695 taken out of their tax refund in April.ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate, even as some on the left are arguing that the fines need to be strengthened.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare Enrollment Sinks Again, Now Trails Worst-Case Scenario

604,AET,"Anthem's proposed merger with Cigna would reduce health care competition and raise costs for consumers, U.S. antitrust lawyers will argue Monday when the government goes to court to block the transaction.Their $48 billion merger — the biggest in the history of the American health -insurance industry — would likely give the enlarged company the power to raise prices for insurance, cut payments to doctors and reduce the quality of service, the Justice Department has said in court papers.Anthem (ANTM) counters that by buying Cigna (CI) it would be able to lower reimbursement rates to health care providers. Those savings would be passed on to employers and policyholders, the Indianapolis-based company says.The Justice Department's lawsuit opposing the Anthem-Cigna merger is one of two health care antitrust cases going to trial in the waning days of the Obama administration as it tries to prevent that industry from shrinking to three national carriers from five. The second case, against the $38 billion tie-up of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), opens before another judge in Washington on Dec. 5. The fifth major carrier, and largest, in the U.S. is UnitedHealth Group (UNH).By challenging the deals earlier this year, President Barack Obama's administration seized an opportunity to further shape the future of health care after passage of the Affordable Care Act.President-elect Donald Trump has said his administration will be more pro-business than his predecessor's, but he has also said he would block AT&T's (T) plan to buy Time Warner (TWX). Trump, who is to take office on Jan. 20, said Friday he would nominate Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. The Alabama Republican doesn't have a clear track record on antitrust issues, leaving his approach to competition preservation unclear.The government said in its complaint that Anthem's deal for Cigna would hurt competition for millions of consumers who receive commercial insurance from national employers as well as large-group employers in at least 35 metropolitan areas, including New York.The run-up to the Anthem-Cigna trial was marked by acrimony between the companies, with each accusing the other of breaching terms of their deal. Cigna stands to collect a $1.85 billion break up fee if the merger is blocked. Last month, the U.S. won an order compelling the companies to turn over written correspondence between the two, which the government argued was relevant to combating the carriers' claims that their combination would create a more efficient company. The U.S. could use those letters as evidence during the trial.""Governance disputes between defendants have escalated, and the firms are now accusing each other of breaching the merger agreement,"" the U.S. said in court papers. ""Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant"" to the defenses raised by the companies.The trial is scheduled to last more than a month, in two phases. In the first, the U.S. will attempt to prove that the combined company would hurt large national employers. The second phase, set to start Dec. 12, will focus on the proposed tie-up's effect on local markets.Backing the Justice Department are 11 states, including New York, California and Connecticut, plus the District of Columbia.Anthem had pushed the judge for a trial scheduled to finish by the end of the year so it has time to get state regulatory approvals by the merger deadline of April 30.
"
605,AET,"The Obama administration's worst-case scenario for 2016 ObamaCare exchange enrollment now looks too optimistic.Third-quarter earnings reports from Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) showed that their combined exchange enrollment totals fell by 113,000 to 1.6 million from the end of June through September, a decline of 6.6%.These two big insurers account for nearly one in six exchange enrollees, and UnitedHealth has tended to see less net enrollment attrition than others, possibly because midyear enrollees tend to be sicker and prefer its broader networks.Bottom line: These enrollment declines provide a strong indication that national enrollment has fallen from an official 10.5 million total as of June 30 to less than 10 million — likely around 9.8 million — at the end of September.On top of that, the fourth quarter appears headed toward big enrollment declines as it has in the past, as people take advantage of the law's 90-day grace period that leaves insurers on the hook even after customers stop paying their premiums. IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem (ATHM) and Centene (CNC) are being dogged by concerns they'll get more unhealthy ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting near a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.In last year's fourth quarter, enrollment fell by about 530,000, or 5.7%, to 8.8 million.Taken together, it now looks like the Obama administration's worst-case scenario of 9.4 million enrollees at year's end has become the best outcome possible. But the trend from UnitedHealth and Aetna, along with last year's fourth-quarter slide, point to a year-end level of 9.25 million enrollees.If that turns out to be true, that would fall well short of the Department of Health and Human Services prediction from last October when it dropped some jaws on how negative 2016 enrollment would be. Despite the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty in 2016 to a minimum of $695 per adult from $325 in 2015, HHS predicted that enrollment would rise only slightly, offering a range of 9.4 million to 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016.While the Obama administration set out the lowest of bars for claiming success, it now looks likely to come up short even by its own generous measure.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. The news that premiums will spike in 2017 — ObamaCare's cheapest plans will cost 28% more — most of the commentary has focused on people with middle-class incomes that earn too much to qualify for subsidies.The Obama administration and the law's defenders emphasize, in rebuttal, that most exchange shoppers are eligible for subsidies. Yet poor enrollment even among those who qualify for subsidies, even though millions will be subject to ObamaCare's individual mandate fine, offers powerful evidence that exchange plans offer a bad deal.Here's why Obama is wrong about ObamaCare: Even among those with working-class incomes at 150% to 250% of the poverty level, lacking insurance from other sources and who were supposed to be big beneficiaries of ObamaCare, two in three are either uninsured or seriously underinsured, an IBD analysis finds.RELATED:Aetna Tops Profit Views Amid Wider ObamaCare LossUnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceObamaCare Subsidies To Explode As Cheapest Bronze-Plan Costs Surge 28%ObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These Cities
"
606,AET,"Window shopping for 2017 ObamaCare plans has just opened on HealthCare.gov, and an IBD analysis of next year's deductibles and premiums — both before subsidies and after — reveals some surprising findings.Overall, the cheapest bronze-plan premium will spike by an average 28.2% before subsidies, based on a review of prices in the biggest market in each of the 38 states utilizing the federal government website. That follows a 12.7% rise in 2016. For a 30-year old, a bronze premium will rise to $272 per month from $212 this year,Six markets will see increases of more than 50%, including Nashville, Tenn. (54%); Columbia, S.C. (54%); Charlotte, N.C. (55%); Chicago (65%); Oklahoma City (80%) and Phoenix (177%).The huge premium hikes will be a shock for middle-class households that earn too much to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies restricted to those earning up to 400% of the poverty level ($47,520 for a single person). But for those who get subsidies, the premium hikes look like much ado about exactly nothing.IBD's analysis looked at how subsidies would change for individuals earning 257% of the poverty level, or $30,539. Here is the shock: Subsidies are set to explode by 99%, to an average $121 per month vs. $61 this year. Once the bigger subsidies are factored in, the average cost of a bronze plan will be $152 per month — exactly the same as in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem and Centene are being dogged by concerns that they'll get more ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting at a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.President Obama last week called for subsidies for the middle class who are excluded from the law's help. Yet IBD explained why Obama's ObamaCare prescription misses the law's most fundamental problem: Two in three people who earning a working-class income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level remain either uninsured or woefully underinsured.Even consumers who are eligible for subsidies and don't face a premium increase may find other reasons to be unhappy about the new offerings at HealthCare.gov. Plan choice is down dramatically as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) exited most exchanges where they are doing business this year, and many nonprofit co-ops went out of business. Even if people can get a plan at the same after-subsidy cost, it may force them to change doctors.UnitedHealth lost 0.5% to 144.69 on the stock market today. Aetna gained 0.7% to 112.02 while Humana ticked up 0.2% to 176.27.The average deductible for the cheapest bronze plan in each of these 38 markets will rise to $6,358, up 5% from $6,045 this year. But that's nothing compared to the rise in deductibles among the cheapest silver plan, which will jump 18% to $4,261 from $3,613 in 2016. That jump is no small part due to the impact of Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC), which carry silver-plan deductibles of up to $7,050. Although the plans do offer some predeductible benefits, most big-ticket items aren't covered until the deductible is exhausted.Centene was up 1.5% to 63.05.The cheapest silver plan is set to rise 25%, IBD finds, to $322 a month from $258 this year. Taking into account the subsidy increase, the cheapest silver plan will cost an average $202, up 2.3% from $197.There are lots of reasons that ObamaCare is poorly designed to attract relatively young and healthy enrollees, even with a mandate penalty for those who go uninsured. A huge increase in subsidies to offset soaring premiums isn't going to make ObamaCare popular all of a sudden, but it may keep most exchanges from entering a death spiral.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralNew ObamaCare Shock: $7,050 Silver-Plan Deductible

607,AET,"UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, sailed past third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, raised its 2016 earnings forecast, and indicated that it would likely boost 2017 guidance next month.Earnings per share climbed 23% to $2.17 vs. the expected $2.08, due to a drop in medical costs as a share of premiums and strong growth in its Optum health services unit, which has seen revenue growth of 34% year to date. Overall revenue rose 12% from a year ago to $46.3 billion, topping estimates of $46.09 billion.The company said it now expects to earn $8 per share for the full year, up from the prior guidance range of $7.80-$7.95 and above consensus estimates for $7.90. And CEO Stephen Hemsley also said 2017 earnings could top consensus views if 2016 ends on a strong note.UnitedHealth shares surged 6.9% to close at 143.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 144.58 buy point.Aetna (AET) rose 2.7%, Humana (HUM) added 2%, Anthem (ANTM) rallied 4.1%, Centene (CNC) rose 2.8, and Molina Healthcare (MOH) gapped up 3.1%.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. UnitedHealth stock has outperformed its peers and is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group. Generally, investors will maximize their chances for success by focusing on leading stocks in top-tier industry groups.Still, UnitedHealth's earnings reflect a company that is much more than an insurer. It also has a leading position in the pharmacy benefit management industry, as well as a provider of population health and revenue management technology services. And UnitedHealth's Optum unit is building walk-in clinics in 75 markets.The sum of its businesses is greater than the parts, allowing it to deliver better health at a lower cost, UnitedHealth management says, and so far its results are proving its value.The earnings release offered no update about the impact of the ObamaCare exchange business on the bottom line because things didn't get any worse. Previously, the company said it expects ObamaCare-compliant policies to be an $850 million drag on earnings this year. But with UnitedHealth set to exit all but three of the 34 state exchanges where it's doing business at year-end, 2017 earnings will get an automatic boost.Aetna and Humana also are scaling back their ObamaCare footprint in 2017 and may get an earnings lift as a result. On the other hand, Anthem, Centene and Molina Healthcare are likely to see their ObamaCare business grow, which some analysts think may be a negative for earnings.In the earnings-call question-and-answer portion, UnitedHealth management said that its ObamaCare exchange enrollment slipped from 870,000 at the end of June to 820,000 at the end of September. If exchange enrollment attrition was similar among other carriers, total exchange enrollment is likely around the 10 million mark, down from 12.7 million signups in February. UnitedHealth also has an additional 110,000 off-exchange members in ObamaCare-compliant products.The company said it will ""lean into"" subsidized markets that are working better, noting new Medicaid contract wins in Virginia and Missouri and the rollout of a new nationwide product for the Medicare prescription-drug market, though one analyst noted that some states are cutting Medicaid reimbursements.""Our growth indicators are positive as we conclude 2016, and we expect to be well-positioned in 2017 to better serve consumers and deliver more value to the health system overall,"" CEO Hemsley said in a statement.RELATED:UnitedHealth Profits To Jump As It Exits ObamaCare ObamaCare Medicaid Costs Rocket 49% Above Estimates

608,AET,"Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI) sank on Wednesday after government data showed that the managed health care providers had a much smaller portion of their members enrolled in higher-quality Medicare plans.The data, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, showed that the percentage of Humana's membership on 4-star or higher plans declined to around 37%, from 78% in the prior year. For Cigna, members enrolled in 4-star or higher plans dropped to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note.The government uses a five-star rating system to evaluate the health-plan offerings. Plans with higher ratings get bonuses, plus bragging rights to tout to Medicare enrollees. The star ratings out today are used for the 2018 plan year.""Weakness in HUM's ratings is a surprise and could hurt HUM's competitive positioning for 2018,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a research note.Humana said that the decline did not account for the company's plans ""to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on Star bonus revenues for 2018."" The company also said the ratings were ""not anticipated to materially impact Medicare membership growth for 2017.""Humana said the decline was likely due to a recent CMS audit that resulted in a civil penalty and downgrades to some Star measures. The company said it expected the impact of the audit on its Star ratings to be limited to the 2018 bonus year.""Humana believes that its Star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect the company's actual performance under the applicable Star measures,"" the company said. ""Consequently, the company intends to file for reconsideration of certain of those ratings under the appropriate administrative process.""Humana tumbled more than 5% to 168.44 on the stock market today, puncturing the bottom of a flat base begun in August. Cigna fell 2.4% to 121.96.Out of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, the Medical-Managed Care group was the worst performer.Humana nonetheless reported strong preliminary third-quarter earnings. The company gave preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15, above forecasts for $2.88. Humana is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 4.Largely on that strong Q3 figure, the health insurer raised its full-year EPS to $9.50, above views for $9.24. In August, Human said it had expected EPS of at least $9.25.IBD'S TAKE: As many large health insurers shrink their Affordable Care Act plan offerings, the law itself could face destruction or a massive overhaul depending on the outcome of next month's election.

609,AET,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

610,AET,"New ObamaCare exchange enrollment via HealthCare.gov continued to lag behind last year's pace during Thanksgiving week. That's an unwelcome sign for the insurance industry and the Obama administration, which has been expecting the ramping up of the individual mandate to boost new sign-ups by as much as 30% this enrollment period.Comparing new enrollment with last year's sign-up period is tricky, because this period runs from Nov. 1 to Feb. 1, while last enrollment season went from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. As the mid-December enrollment deadline for being covered on New Year's Day approaches, activity will pick up.So ObamaCare supporters needn't panic yet that HealthCare.gov has signed up only 714,000 new customers through the first four weeks of open enrollment, nearly 40% below the 1,176,000 through four weeks of enrollment last year.Still, even comparing the last two full weeks of November with the same period a year ago, new enrollment ran 6% below last year's pace.ObamaCare Stakes High In 2016The stakes are high for ObamaCare in 2016: UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, says that it may bow out of the individual exchange business if it can't turn a profit this year. Other insurers, including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM), marked down their expectations after seeing a big outflow of customers in the third quarter. While they're expressing patience, a weak enrollment year could lead to another big round of premium hikes for 2017.A ruling on the House lawsuit against the Obama administration for spending never-appropriated billions on cost-sharing subsidies will come during the spring, and a victory for Republicans would cast further doubt on ObamaCare's future.So far, the Obama administration is releasing data for only the 37 states whose exchanges are operated by HealthCare.gov. New enrollees include anyone who didn't hold an exchange policy when they signed up in the current enrollment period — even if they had signed up previously and dropped their coverage for whatever reason.New enrollment is only part of the equation. Getting current members to re-up also matters. So does getting people who sign up to pay for coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services expects up to 14.1 million people to sign up, including as many as 5.4 million new members, but it sees paid enrollment falling to a maximum of 11.4 million at year-end 2016.Some analysts see 11.4 million as a low-ball estimate. In any case, a total of 5.4 million new sign-ups doesn't look likely, since the pace of sign-ups is running behind last year's total, which ended below 4.2 million.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

"
624,AET,"The root of ObamaCare's mounting problems is that far too many people — even those eligible for big subsidies — see the plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine.That goes a long way to explaining why the exchanges are attracting a small group of customers who are disproportionately old and in relatively poor health, why the cheapest bronze-plan premiums are set to spike 28%, and why UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are bolting most of the markets where they're doing business.In replacing ObamaCare with ""something terrific,"" as Donald Trump has pledged to do, he may not find it especially hard to give a better deal to those millions of middle-class and working-class households that get a bad deal from the exchanges. Yet Trump also will have to find a way to meet the needs of millions of low-income families and older adults, many with costly chronic conditions, for whom the law has been a godsend.The reality check for Trump is that there is a vast gap between the financial support that a modest-income older adult with a chronic condition will need to make health care affordable and what the GOP is on record as supporting.This look at just how the Empowering Patients First Act, a GOP blueprint for replacing ObamaCare, would serve the needs of modest-income, older adults relative to the ObamaCare exchanges should be eye-opening — to say the least.Consider that for a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level ($23,895), an ObamaCare silver plan in 2017 will cost a bit less than $1,000, after subsidies, and cap out-of-pocket spending at $1,000 to $2,000. That means, in a really bad scenario, the couple might end up spending from 8% to 12% of annual income on insurance and medical bills.A key question is how much low-income adults can reasonably afford to pay in premiums and additional medical expenses before the cost of health care overwhelms their finances. Those on the right worried about the size of government might argue that the couple could reasonably afford to pay a somewhat bigger share of income, but how much more? Would it be reasonable to put this couple on the hook for up to 15% of income? Would 25% of income make the couple shoulder too much financial risk?Now consider how the couple would fare under the Empowering Patients First Act, legislation put forward by House and Senate Republicans that has been at least loosely endorsed by every GOP health policy wonk. The same low-deductible coverage that costs less than $1,000 in after-subsidy premiums under ObamaCare could cost the couple about $18,000 under this leading Republican plan, putting them on the hook for up to 80% of their annual income, including out-of-pocket costs.How does a sub-$1,000 plan under ObamaCare turn into an $18,000 plan under the GOP? First, the GOP believes it's a bad idea to provide subsidies that rise with income, because that can be an incentive for people to earn less, but there are other ways to mitigate this concern than slashing subsidies to lower earners. The GOP plan gives $6,000 to couples at least 50 years old to help with premiums. Back in 2015, before exchange premiums began to spike due to the exchanges' stunted growth and unhealthy risk pool, ObamaCare gave the same couple a premium subsidy of $14,846, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health subsidy calculator.(For 2017, ObamaCare's subsidy will rise to $19,592 to offset the surge in premiums. The comparison here uses ObamaCare's 2015 premiums and subsidies to provide a fair comparison, or else the GOP subsidies would look stingier.)Second, even a comparison of premium subsidies understates the cost difference between ObamaCare and GOP alternatives, because ObamaCare provides another layer of subsidies to low-income enrollees to offset out-of-pocket costs. Those extra cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid directly to insurers, effectively turn a silver plan to platinum, lowering the cap on out-of-pocket medical bills from about $13,000 to $2,000 or less. For the older 64-year-old couple, those extra cost-sharing subsidies effectively add just over $5,000 to ObamaCare's premium subsidy.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of some health insurers have been flying since Donald Trump's surprise victory, now that big mergers might get a friendlier hearing than they did from the Obama administration. Although UnitedHealth is staying solo, for now, its stock surged above a buy point and hit a record high. Meanwhile, Centene and Molina, the fastest growing insurers in the ObamaCare era, are tanking amid uncertainty about the Medicaid expansion on top of sagging hopes for the exchanges. Check out the group at IBD Stock Checkup. So, as far as subsidies go, ObamaCare is giving the 64-year-old couple just under $20,000 to the $6,000 provided by the leading GOP plan. Yet, even that understates the cost gap for low-income older adults, because GOP plans would eliminate the ObamaCare regulation that limits how much insurers can charge older adults to three times the premium charged to 24-year-olds. Removing that age-rating restriction and returning insurance markets to the common 5-to-1 gap between premiums charged to old and young before ObamaCare would raise the cost of premiums (before subsidies) by about 16.5%. So the older couple would have a much smaller subsidy to buy a more expensive plan.The comparison is a rough one, because ObamaCare's list of essential benefits might raise the cost of exchange plans by 3% to 9%, various analyses have shown. Yet that doesn't change the math very much.The challenge of taking care of the needs of low-income ObamaCare enrollees with chronic health problems helps explain why, before the election, a murderer's row of health policy wonks offered a GOP plan to kill ObamaCare softly. The plan from the American Enterprise Institute effectively promised that people who liked their ObamaCare plan could keep it, while everyone who got a bad deal under the law could opt for the new GOP deal. Their goal was to make the idea of replacing ObamaCare less scary for the public and to avoid the backlash seen in 2013 with the cancellations of millions of plans. Yet the promise people can keep their ObamaCare plan is an empty one because the approach would drain younger, healthier people from the risk pool and would undoubtedly trigger the kind of death spiral that conservatives have warned about. Insurers would simply refuse to participate.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare Subsidies To Explode As Cheapest Bronze-Plan Costs Surge 28%

625,AET,"Anthem (ANTM) said Wednesday it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses. The retreats threaten to further destabilize coverage in the markets for individual coverage, known as exchanges, that provide insurance to millions of Americans.""If we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path toward sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018,"" Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said on a call discussing third-quarter results. ""Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.""Anthem sells health coverage under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in 14 states. The company will continue offering plans for next year in the new markets created by the Affordable Care Act. If it pulls back in 2018, it will leave mostly regional and not-for-profit firms on the markets.Swedish said that the U.S. needed to help insurers get better prices under the law, as well as improve the regulations that govern the sale and administration of plans. He also said that too few people were signing up. The company said Wednesday that it had 889,000 people signed up under individual ObamaCare plans at the end of the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Anthem shares have been steadily declining since reaching an intraday peak of 173.59 in June 2015. Shares touched a two-year low during opening trades on Wednesday but then recovered and closed up nearly 4% from Tuesday's nine-month low. Anthem is the second-biggest insurer in the U.S., just behind UnitedHealth, but UnitedHealth is tops among managed-care providers in IBD rankings, while Anthem is eighth.""The financial performance in individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing as membership has been short of our original expectations,"" Swedish said. The company could also pull back from some states and not others, executives said on the call.Earlier Wednesday, Anthem reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates as medical spending increased, driven in part by costs in the company's business serving poor people through Medicaid.Net income fell to $617.8 million, or $2.30 a share, from $654.8 million, or $2.43, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.5% to $21.4 billion. Anthem spent 85.5 cents of every premium dollar on medical costs, compared with a medical loss ratio of 83.6 cents per dollar a year earlier. Medical membership rose to 39.9 million people as of Sept. 30 from 39.8 million three months earlier.Adjusted profit was $2.45 a share, Anthem said Wednesday in a statement, compared with the $2.47 average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year adjusted profit will be about $10.80 a share, Anthem said, compared with the company's forecast earlier this year that it would report more than $10.80.Anthem, which agreed more than a year ago to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, is now facing a court battle to win U.S. approval of the deal. The Justice Department sued to block the takeover on antitrust grounds in July, saying the combined firm would control too much of the market for health insurance sold to big employers.While the company added more customers in its Medicaid business, costs there rose as well, which hurt profitability in the quarter. Anthem said expenses also rose in its individual business, which includes plans sold under ObamaCare.Anthem's stock has declined 16% this year, the second-worst performance among the six biggest U.S. health insurers.

627,AET,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment has tumbled from 12.7 million people who signed up for plans as of early February to 10.5 million at the end of June, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday.Even worse, an early snapshot of third-quarter enrollment on Tuesday from UnitedHealth (UNH) -- which saw its exchange enrollment slide by 50,000, or 6%, to 770,000 from June to September — suggests that national enrollment has fallen to 10 million, perhaps lower.The fact that the big drop in enrollment in the first half of the year even exceeds the attrition rate seen in the first half of 2015 should be a major concern, given that the cost of going uninsured jumped in 2016 with the ramping up of ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695, from $325 last year. This year, about 8 million people paid ObamaCare's penalty for going without coverage. When so many millions of people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine, ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate.What is more, the Obama administration is only expecting modestly better enrollment in 2017. The official estimate released Wednesday predicts 13.8 million people will select plans during the open enrollment period, with paid monthly enrollment averaging 11.4 million. Still, that's better than some outside analysts expect. Goldman Sachs predicted recently that enrollment could drop by 20% from 2016 levels amid surging premiums and the exit of major carriers including UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most of the exchanges where they do business this year.Other research analysts have warned investors that companies like Anthem (ANTH) and Centene (CNC) could take a profit hit in 2017 as they capture some of the enrollment from exiting players. JPMorgan Chase downgraded shares of Anthem to neutral from overweight this week, citing the company's exposure to the ObamaCare risk pool due to averse selection, as higher prices lead healthier customers to drop coverage.Political opponents of ObamaCare have hailed its run of really bad news, including some jaw-dropping rate hikes, as evidence that the exchanges are close to blowing up. The irony, though, is that the spike in premiums may help to temporarily stabilize the exchanges.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. Here are three reasons why the near-term outlook for the exchanges may not be as disastrous as many critics expect, even though everyone should be against the status quo in which ObamaCare is failing far too many millions of Americans who could really use a better deal.Few insurance markets are more expensive than New York for young adults because the state is alone in imposing a 1:1 age rating on individual market insurers, meaning that 24-year-olds pay just as much as 64-year-olds. In most states before ObamaCare, insurers could charge a 64-year-old five times as much as a young adult. Some ObamaCare critics have blamed the law's age-rating restriction, allowing insurers to charge older adults only three times as much as a young adult, for the exchanges' failure to attract a younger, healthier risk pool.Yet New York is so expensive that subsidies actually make ObamaCare coverage relatively inexpensive — at least bronze-level coverage. Take the cost of a bronze plan this year for a 30-year-old earning about $32,500. For a full year, the bronze plan costs $3,577 in Albany, N.Y., but just $2,459 in Miami — before any subsidy. But a young adult at that income level gets no subsidy in Florida, even as the New Yorker gets a subsidy of $1,836, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health insurance marketplace calculator. Bottom line: The individual in Albany saves $60 a month vs. the one in Miami.BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina is boosting its ObamaCare premiums by 24.3% in 2017. That's higher than its original request of an 18.8% increase, which the insurer revised after UnitedHealth's exit from the market. But the bad news may turn out to be good news for many of its customers. Because of the way ObamaCare subsidies work, 72% of its customers will pay either the same or less than they're paying this year, the company explained.Those who don't qualify for subsidies because they earn more than 400% of the poverty level may get badly hurt by the coming premium hikes. That seems unfair because there is no income cap for getting tax-subsidized health insurance through one's employer. Still, about 85% of exchange customers get subsidies, and the Obama administration explained recently that 2.5 million of 6.9 million off-exchange customers have incomes low enough to qualify for subsidies. Many may be in the same situation as the young adult in the Miami example: unsubsidized because of the way age and income interact in ObamaCare's subsidy formula.Yet many people who get little or nothing in the way of subsidies this year may find that they qualify for substantially more in 2017. That's not to say that higher premiums and bigger subsidies will fix ObamaCare — they won't.  Many will qualify for bigger subsidies for policies that they still don't want. There's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.With the increasing likelihood that Hillary Clinton will be the next president and she'll have to work with a Republican House of Representatives, there's a strong chance that the individual and employer mandates will be repealed in order to pave the way for the next chapter of health reform.While the ObamaCare exchanges are good for the near-poor and those with pre-existing conditions who qualify for big subsidies, there's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.Here's one data point that drives home one of ObamaCare's biggest and most important failures. Back in 2013, the Obama administration set a first-year target of 2.7 million enrollees age 18 to 34 — and enrollment was expected to keep ramping up in a big way in subsequent years — but the best evidence suggests that young adult enrollment is currently south of that first-year goal, likely around 2.5 million.That inference is pretty clear because young adults made up just under 28% of signups in 2016, but the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were age 18 to 34.RELATED:ObamaCare Individual Mandate Fine Hit 8 Million People This Year ObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

628,AET,"The main indexes closed narrowly mixed Wednesday afternoon after details of the Fed's September meeting left few doubts that a rate increase is looming.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1%. But the Nasdaq dipped 0.1%. Volume was lower across the board, suggesting a lack of appetite among institutional buyers.Minutes fr0m the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting left more signs that policymakers are inclined to raise interest rates by year's end. In fact, a rate hike last month was termed a ""close call"" by participants, who judged the economy strong enough to make a ""reasonable argument"" to raise the fed funds rate.Some officials voiced concern that a delay in a rate increase could hurt the Fed's credibility. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee saw Brexit risks receding and that the labor market has improved appreciably in past year. Those are ingredients for an increase in borrowing costs.Mining, retail and some building stocks led today's trading, while the health care sector continued to show broad weakness. Managed-care stocks made up a cluster of stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Humana (HUM) plunged 5% in heavy volume. The HMO had been forming a shallow base, but the sell-off has soiled the pattern. Humana announced preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15 a share, above views. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the company's share of members in four-star or higher-quality plans fell to around 37%, from 78% the prior year. The drop threatens to hurt bonuses that Humana earns.Aetna (AET), which is fighting antitrust issues to acquire Humana, fell 1.5% to the lowest level since May.Cigna (CI) was down more than 2% as its four-star-or-higher enrollments dived to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note. Anthem (ANTM), which is trying to merge with Cigna, was off nearly 1%. That deal also faces objections from the U.S. Justice Department.In other parts of the medical sector, Illumina (ILMN) continued to weaken following Tuesday's 25% crash on a lowered sales outlook.

Higher-end models track heart rate.""We continue to believe that a large portion of Fitbit owners stop using the device within months, which is a fundamental issue driving high churn and that will make growth more challenging,"" Erickson said.Fitbit also is facing increased competition from more capable smartwatches that have fitness features, such as the Apple Watch Series 2.Apple's (AAPL) deal with Aetna (AET) is a ""substantial negative"" for Fitbit, which has been trying to grow its corporate wellness business, Erickson said.Health insurer Aetna announced Tuesday that it will subsidize the cost of the Apple Watch to select large employers and individual customers in the upcoming enrollment season. Aetna also will provide Apple Watch at no cost to its nearly 50,000 employees, who will participate in the company's wellness reimbursement program.Aetna shares fell 1% in afternoon trade.

637,AET,"BY JED GRAHAMHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell recently declared that the latest ObamaCare sign-up tally was proof that the exchanges offer ""a product that consumers need, want and like.""Yet the one family that she highlighted to demonstrate that ""the Affordable Care Act is working"" does more to cast doubt on her claims than to back them up.Is it really proof that a family wants and likes your product if you threaten to impose a $650 tax on them for not buying it when the product costs only $492?And how badly does any family really need coverage that won't begin to pay for medical treatments until after their finances are blown up?A million or more ObamaCare customers may find themselves in roughly the same straits this year. An individual earning a bit more than $20,000 a year will be able to buy a bronze plan for less than the minimum $325 individual mandate that the government will impose at tax time next year, the Kaiser Family Foundation health insurance marketplace calculator shows.The same appears to apply for a family of four earning a bit more than $40,000.Don't Get SickOf course, even though a family would have to throw away money if it doesn't buy your product, that doesn't mean that the family isn't a happy customer.A closer look at the family that Burwell touted as a success story shows why it may be pleased with its coverage — as long as the family members don't get sick.Here is what Burwell says about the family: Laura Gonzalez is a 26-year-old mother of two who is studying to be an ultrasound technician. She and her husband, a truck driver who doesn't get coverage through his employer, live in Jacksonville, Fla. They were able to get a subsidized exchange plan for $41 a month.The low cost implies that the family earns so little that the children are covered under CHIP. A check of Healthcare.gov reveals that the cheapest bronze coverage in Jacksonville is $41 a month for two adults in a family of four with earnings of $38,300.That plan, from Aetna's (AET) Coventry Health Care, carries a $12,600 family deductible, apparently offering only preventive care before the deductible is paid.The Commonwealth Fund considers individuals and families earning up to 200% of the poverty level to be underinsured if they have to spend more than 5% of income on medical care, excluding premiums.The ObamaCare plan chosen by the Gonzalezes, whose income puts them at about 160% of the poverty level, could have them pay as much as 33% of income before it starts covering nonpreventative medical bills.Yet in the same op-ed, Burwell touts a Commonwealth Fund survey revealing a drop in the number of Americans putting off necessary care or facing financial distress because of medical bills.That's undoubtedly true, given that more than 10 million have joined Medicaid since the fall of 2013. The subsidized ObamaCare exchanges also have contributed to making health care bills more manageable — at least for low-income households able to afford silver-level coverage. Silver plans have extra cost-sharing subsidies to hold down medical expenses on top of premiums.The Gonzalezes could have gotten a silver plan for about $142 a month, or $1,704 a year — an extra $101 per month vs. bronze coverage. It would have shrunk their deductible to $2,900 this year — $9,700 less than the plan they chose — while limiting their maximum expense (excluding premiums) to $3,800.Signing Up To Avoid FinesIn January, the Congressional Budget Office cut its projection of spending on cost-sharing subsidies through 2024 by $39 billion because it expects that 3 million low-income ObamaCare enrollees will forgo the subsidies.""Some people purchasing coverage through exchanges solely to comply with the individual mandate will be focused on minimizing their premium payments and thus will continue to choose bronze plans,"" the CBO said.

638,AET,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is expected to produce its best performance in years when it reports first-quarter results Thursday, while its stock price continues to trade near record highs following a major acquisition at the end of March.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the nation's No. 1 health insurer to post Q1 earnings of $1.34 a share, up 22% from the prior year. If that holds up, it would be the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2012.Revenue is seen rising 9% to $34.6 billion, which would be the biggest top-line increase since the September 2013 quarter.In Q4 2014, UnitedHealth topped sales and earnings views, as its Optum Health Services platform delivered a 23% revenue gain. Optum includes a managed care business, a software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) provider.The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get a lot bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran (CTRX), which was announced on March 30. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The merged entity will serve 65 million customers — nearly twice the 35 million that Catamaran currently serves. That should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs, analysts say.""The combination of the two entities will take the total annual prescriptions filled to nearly 1 billion and make it the third largest player in the industry with a market share of around 20%,"" Trefis analysts noted in a recent report.In comparison, the report said, ""CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), which together control more than 50% of the PBM market, filled around 1 billion prescriptions each in 2014.""Trefis says OptumRx was the fastest-growing business in the entire Optum division in 2014: ""OptumRx revenues have almost doubled since 2010, and there was improvement in the bottom line as well. This is exhibited by the fact that EBITDA margins improved from under 3% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2014.""UnitedHealth has an IBD Composite Rating of 92.

A check of Healthcare.gov reveals that the cheapest bronze coverage in Jacksonville is $41 a month for two adults in a family of four with earnings of $38,300.That plan, from Aetna's (AET) Coventry Health Care, carries a $12,600 family deductible, apparently offering only preventive care before the deductible is paid.The Commonwealth Fund considers individuals and families earning up to 200% of the poverty level to be underinsured if they have to spend more than 5% of income on medical care, excluding premiums.The ObamaCare plan chosen by the Gonzalezes, whose income puts them at about 160% of the poverty level, could have them pay as much as 33% of income before it starts covering nonpreventative medical bills.Yet in the same op-ed, Burwell touts a Commonwealth Fund survey revealing a drop in the number of Americans putting off necessary care or facing financial distress because of medical bills.That's undoubtedly true, given that more than 10 million have joined Medicaid since the fall of 2013. The subsidized ObamaCare exchanges also have contributed to making health care bills more manageable — at least for low-income households able to afford silver-level coverage. Silver plans have extra cost-sharing subsidies to hold down medical expenses on top of premiums.The Gonzalezes could have gotten a silver plan for about $142 a month, or $1,704 a year — an extra $101 per month vs. bronze coverage. It would have shrunk their deductible to $2,900 this year — $9,700 less than the plan they chose — while limiting their maximum expense (excluding premiums) to $3,800.Signing Up To Avoid FinesIn January, the Congressional Budget Office cut its projection of spending on cost-sharing subsidies through 2024 by $39 billion because it expects that 3 million low-income ObamaCare enrollees will forgo the subsidies.""Some people purchasing coverage through exchanges solely to comply with the individual mandate will be focused on minimizing their premium payments and thus will continue to choose bronze plans,"" the CBO said.

680,AET,"When Michael Farrell took the helm of ResMed in March, he came aboard in interesting times.
"
681,AET,"His father, Peter Farrell, had founded and built the company into a leader in devices to treat sleep apnea — disruptions to breathing while sleeping — with rock-steady quarterly growth and a frequent residency in the IBD 50.
"
682,AET,"But 2013 has been a difficult year for the industry. ObamaCare brought with it a new tax on devices, and the second round of competitive bidding under the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act has been squeezing prices. The magnitude of the latter was one reason ResMed's fiscal first quarter, reported in late October, missed expectations and hurt the stock.
"
683,AET,"Yet, Farrell is confident in the growth prospects for ResMed (RMD), as it continues to penetrate sleep apnea and branches out into respiratory care. He spoke with IBD recently about his new gig.
"
684,AET,"IBD: The impact of the competitive bidding seemed to take Wall Street by surprise in the last quarter. Did it surprise you?
"
685,AET,"Farrell: To put things in perspective, the U.S. market is about 50% of our global business, and Medicare is about 25% of that. So you're talking about 12% or less of the covered lives ResMed looks after.
"
686,AET,"It's been a two- or three-year process since competitive bidding, round one, started. Round one was nine cities, and competitive bidding round two was 91 cities. So we already knew there would be different impacts, but clearly there's been some temporary distraction of our channel through round two. We had indicated it to the market and had discussions about it. I think when the reality of it hit in Q1, there were some investors who may have been slightly surprised. But we always knew it would be a challenge, and we said on the (earnings conference) call that it will take a number of months for the distraction to clear up.
"
687,AET,"But the real focus is the long-term growth, which is incredibly exciting. What we focused on, talking about the rest of FY2014 and beyond, (was) that patient volumes — even in the U.S. market, even affected with ObamaCare, even with global financial crisis recovery and unemployment rates where they are — the patients turning up in primary-care offices, getting referrals to specialists in sleep diagnosis and therapy, (are) solid. So it's like you've got a garden hose with a bit of a crimp in it. Over the coming months, the garden hose is going to straighten out and start fertilizing the lawn.
"
688,AET,"IBD: After the last report, analyst Raj Denhoy of Jefferies wrote, ""There is still little acknowledgment from the company that private insurers could follow (Medicare's) lead and slash rates in the approximate 65% of the market outside Medicare."" How do you respond to that?
"
689,AET,"Farrell: It's about 75% that's private pay — Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI), Blue Cross/Blue Shield, innumerable others. What private payors have been doing for the last 10 to 15 years is adjusting on a mark-to-market, supply-and-demand basis on all of their services. (They've) actually had a very efficient reimbursement-reduction program. They do not respond to Medicare because Medicare really had a public process to try and catch up with where private pay already was. So private pay isn't looking to Medicare saying, ""Oooh, should we adjust rates 'cause they've caught up to us?"" It's the other way around.
"
690,AET,"IBD: What can we expect from ResMed over the next year?
"
691,AET,"Farrell: We've got quite a lot of exciting announcements for the coming 12 months. We will have three new mask systems. In the last 12 months (our mask systems) changed north of 7 million lives. We delivered around a million devices that sit on someone's bedside table that provide pressured, humidified and controlled air to the lungs. And we also delivered north of 6 million mask systems that have to be comfortable because the patients wear them all night and for the rest of their lives every night. We have three new products on that 6 million side, where ResMed is really the global leader and the No. 1 patient-preferred brand.
"
692,AET,"Of course, I can't give you details about them, but I can give you a personal anecdote. I wear our devices. I don't have apnea, but like many people I have a tendency to snore when I use alcohol or have a large meal. In testing our products, my wife found that when I use the product I don't snore. And I actually feel better in the morning — have less of a hangover and more of an ability to participate with my children.

720,AET,"Aetna (AET) Chief Executive Mark Bertolini defended his company's participation in ObamaCare public exchanges in 17 states as ""a risk worth taking,"" but worried that technical glitches in the federal government's website would keep younger, healthy people from enrolling.
"
721,AET,"""The younger healthy people are not going to give (enrollment sites) more than one shot so it could mean adverse selection in 2014,"" Bertolini said during a conference call Tuesday after the release of the firm's third-quarter results.
"
722,AET,"Bertolini said Aetna is working closely with the Obama administration to ""improve the exchange enrollment process.""
"
723,AET,"Aetna, the third largest health insurer in the U.S., said operating earnings fell 3% from the earlier year to $1.50 a share, missing analysts' views by 3 cents.
"
724,AET,"But operating revenue jumped 46% to a little under $13 billion, above views. Medical membership grew 22% to 22.2 million as the company logged its first full quarter with government insurance-focused Coventry Health, which it acquired in May.
"
725,AET,"Aetna also reaffirmed per-share earnings guidance for 2013 of $5.85-$5.90, which would be a 14% increase at the mid-point vs. 2012. The implied Q4 EPS guidance of $1.33-$1.38 is about in line with views.
"
726,AET,"The company didn't give specific 2014 guidance, but the CEO said the firm expects the ""floor"" on 2014's per-share operating earnings to be consistent with 2013's.
"
727,AET,"CFO Shawn Guertin added that any upside ""could be more difficult"" to achieve than in recent years as health-care utilization levels increase from their low levels.
"
728,AET,"Bertolini said cuts in government funding to Medicare Advantage programs would also likely pressure margins in 2014.

734,AET,"Bertolini was most excited about opportunities in private exchanges, which he said are more profitable than self-funded plans.Aetna (AET) Chief Executive Mark Bertolini defended his company's participation in ObamaCare public exchanges in 17 states as ""a risk worth taking,"" but worried that technical glitches in the federal government's website would keep younger, healthy people from enrolling.""The younger healthy people are not going to give (enrollment sites) more than one shot so it could mean adverse selection in 2014,"" Bertolini said during a conference call Tuesday after the release of the firm's third-quarter results.Bertolini said Aetna is working closely with the Obama administration to ""improve the exchange enrollment process.""Aetna, the third largest health insurer in the U.S., said operating earnings fell 3% from the earlier year to $1.50 a share, missing analysts' views by 3 cents.But operating revenue jumped 46% to a little under $13 billion, above views. Medical membership grew 22% to 22.2 million as the company logged its first full quarter with government insurance-focused Coventry Health, which it acquired in May.Aetna also reaffirmed per-share earnings guidance for 2013 of $5.85-$5.90, which would be a 14% increase at the mid-point vs. 2012. The implied Q4 EPS guidance of $1.33-$1.38 is about in line with views.The company didn't give specific 2014 guidance, but the CEO said the firm expects the ""floor"" on 2014's per-share operating earnings to be consistent with 2013's.CFO Shawn Guertin added that any upside ""could be more difficult"" to achieve than in recent years as health-care utilization levels increase from their low levels.Bertolini said cuts in government funding to Medicare Advantage programs would also likely pressure margins in 2014.Aetna's shares fell nearly 2%. WellPoint (WLP), the second-biggest U.S. insurer, fell more than 1%. No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth (UNH), which has a light exposure to public exchanges, rose 1%.Aetna's CEO said the public exchanges will not contribute to his company's revenue and profits in a meaningful way next year but said they are ""here to stay and we need to participate in some way.""The amount of risk we're taking is minimal to our overall results,"" Bertolini said, noting that the company is most competitive in catastrophic and bronze-plan offerings.""We worry about things like extended open enrollment and how long it goes on. We worry about the individual mandate not getting stronger,"" Bertolini said.""We think that participation of the full population is important. So the enrollment process and web site is incredibly important to get right.""Bertolini was most excited about opportunities in private exchanges, which he said are more profitable than self-funded plans.

736,AET,"Like a lot of managed care companies, Aetna has seen its stock price rise in recent weeks as investors get more comfortable with the idea that the Affordable Care Act might not send the industry tumbling over the cliff after all.Aetna (AET), the No. 3 publicly traded managed care firm by market cap, provides managed health care services nationwide to more than 36 million members.Its services are available through Point of Service plans, Preferred Provider Organizations, HMOs, Health Savings Accounts and other plans.The company has one of the largest memberships on Affordable Care Act (ACA), or ObamaCare, exchanges. In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Justin Lake noted that at the end of the first quarter, Aetna had 230,000 paid public exchange members, ""with expectations it will nearly double in size to 450,000"" by the end of the year.A few months ago — when managed-care companies were fretting over the risks and costs associated with ACA exchanges — having a large exposure to ObamaCare was considered a vulnerability.Those fears have eased in recent weeks, even if they haven't gone away altogether.""Early indicators on the risk profile look manageable relative to their pricing assumptions, though Aetna notes it is still early days and they lack enough experience to draw meaningful conclusions,"" Lake said.Coping With ObamaCareThe managed care industry has had few good things to say about ObamaCare, blaming it for everything from higher costs and tighter margins to more competition. Still, there's little question that recent news surrounding the program has calmed investor nerves.Aetna shares are up about 13% since an April 17 dip and currently trade near 76. Aetna and IBD's Medical-Managed Care group have both risen 10% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 index has lifted just 2%.""Almost everything moving these stocks has been Affordable Care related,"" said Vishnu Lekraj, analyst at Morningstar. ""A lot of the movement depends on how the major managed care firms have navigated the new landscape, and that's been largely positive.""These firms have been able to price their affordable care products better than investors initially expected, Lekraj says, and they have ""definitely"" been able to execute better than investors expected.""It's not that Affordable Care is great for the industry. There's still margin compression, more competition and a lot of headwinds,"" he said. ""But it's not as bad as everyone thought it would be, which has helped share prices.""Among the recent positive developments is a surge in younger members signing up for coverage under the ACA. Early ACA enrollees tended to be older than the managed care industry originally anticipated and had a higher-than-expected use of medical services.The increase in younger, healthier members helps lower the risk profile for exchanges.""The estimate is that you need about 30% to 40% of younger, healthier members to offset members who are older or may have health problems, and we have definitely seen more younger people signing up,"" Lekraj said. ""We should continue to see that happen.""While UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the largest managed care company, recently said ObamaCare costs and high drug prices have hurt its earnings, other firms have offered a more positive take.Earlier this month Cigna (CI) raised its full-year earnings guidance and sounded upbeat about the fact that more younger people began to sign up for ObamaCare during the last weeks of open enrollment.Meanwhile, WellPoint (WLP) said it would simply raise prices to offset costs tied to ObamaCare.Aetna officials were not available for comment. A spokeswoman with the company referred IBD to a webcast of Aetna investor presentations during the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference, held May 14, and the UBS Global Healthcare Conference, held May 20.During those presentations, Aetna said that one of its main focuses this year will be ""collecting or solving"" ACA-mandated fees and taxes.The company said that it accrued about $240 million of ACA mandated fees during the first quarter. It looks to offset some of those costs this year through a combination of price, premium and cost adjustments.'Manageable' ExposureAccording to a report that accompanied the investor presentation, Aetna said its public exchange membership ""still represents a manageable financial exposure.""While ObamaCare has garnered most of the recent attention surrounding Aetna and other managed care firms, it's not the only trend that has been changing the industry. Consolidation has been a major story as well.Aetna itself has seen a big spike in revenue in recent quarters, thanks to its $5.7 billion buyout of Coventry Health Care last year.When that deal closed, Aetna estimated that its synergies from the buyout would total about $50 million in 2013. The company later said it ""achieved the high end of its target,"" Citigroup analyst Carl McDonald noted in a report.""Aetna is projecting synergies of $150 million in 2014 and $200 million in 2015, driven by medical cost and network synergies, operational streamlining, vendor re-contracting and specialty pharmacy migration,"" McDonald added.More recently, Aetna in April completed its acquisition of UK-based InterGlobal from a group led by its majority shareholder, Alchemy Partners. InterGlobal specializes in international private medical insurance for groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe. Terms were not disclosed.Financially, Aetna has grown revenue at least 31% each of the last four quarters. During the previous six quarters, it logged only one quarter of double-digit growth.The company's first-quarter revenue gained 47% from the prior year to $14 billion — the biggest increase in years. Operating earnings climbed 27% to $1.98 a share, topping consensus estimates for $1.55.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 11% this year and 10% in 2015.

749,AET,"If 2014 seems daunting, give it a solid foundation. Build balance in yourself before taking a big leap.One approach comes from the other side of the globe. Ram Nidumolu, chief operating officer of business consulting firm Blu Skye and the author of  ""Two Birds in a Tree,""  helps executives by applying  Indian wisdom to their endeavors.His first tip: Think big.""We are so oriented in the short term, that which needs to be done immediately,"" Nidumolu told IBD. ""We are driven by what needs to be done in the short term. But we forget the context.""Ready to build a movement? Start by grasping the essence of who you are.In India, they call it Being.Martin Luther King Jr. voyaged to India in 1959 to study this philosophy and other ideas promoted by Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi.""To other countries I may go as a tourist,"" King said at the time. ""But to India I come as a pilgrim.""By the time he got back to America, he had sharpened his mission. He had also honed the peaceful resistance philosophy that drove the civil rights movement.The idea of protesting without violence came directly from the same Indian traditions and stories that Nidumolu uses to inspire today's leaders.How to build your base the ancient Indian way:• Imagine being CEO. ""Every person associated with business has the potential to be a business leader,"" Nidumolu said.The best chiefs are curious, caring, and always hunting for winning connections and a sense that they are making the world better through their labors.Start doing your part today.• Believe. Think mission when pursuing a particular goal or benchmark. When you know your calling, ""the scope of business — such as business purpose and vision, stakeholders, success criteria and management approaches — now becomes broader,"" Nidumolu said.• Sage it up. After a ski accident left him in constant pain, Aetna (AET) CEO Mark Bertolini was prescribed a handful of different narcotic painkillers that kept him from going to work. He didn't want to live that way, so he searched for alternative remedies.Among them: meditation, the act of regularly sitting quietly and focusing on breathing for a short period. It's a staple in India.To his surprise, Bertolini found that he had a stronger sense of purpose and got more done when he meditated. Plus, he was able to kick the painkillers.""People say, 'How do you block out everything for that long in meditation?' But meditation isn't about blocking out all that stuff. Meditation is about taking what comes, giving it appropriate reference and letting it go. Losing attachment,"" he said at a wellness conference last fall.Now Aetna trains its employees to meditate as a strategy for lessening stress and reducing sick days.• Flip troubles. Nidumolu says that crisis, if reframed, can become jet fuel for strengthening your company's values or realizing your own purpose.""You realize, 'I am here not to just do, but there is something else that has a larger meaning for my life. I need to leave a legacy,' "" he said.• See it. Your actions gain power if you use your brain, with its knack for advancing you with verve.Let studying, research, praying, visualization and routine gut checks anchor the decisions and actions you take at work.Said Nidumolu: ""Internal imagination and external work are two sources of knowledge that are necessary.""

792,AET,"They also point out that exchange subsidies will offset higher ObamaCare costs for many, and that in any case, higher premiums are worth it given the protections against coverage denials and the more comprehensive benefits required.
"
793,AET,"But not everyone will be eligible for these subsidies, which phase out entirely at 400% of the poverty rate. And even with them, costs will still go up for many. A young worker making $20,000 in Maryland, for example, would pay about $1,000 for the cheapest ObamaCare plan, after the subsidy. That's still $278 more than the least expensive plan offered in the state today.
"
794,AET,"And higher rates pose a significant risk to ObamaCare's success. If not enough young people sign up, premium costs will spiral upward.
"
795,AET,"That's been the experience in six states that have already imposed ObamaCare-style market reforms — known as ""guaranteed issue"" and ""community rating."" These rules prevent insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people who are sick. But they can easily backfire.
"
796,AET,"Because coverage is guaranteed, people have an incentive to put off buying insurance until they get sick, thereby saving premium costs in the meantime. And the community rating rules reduce premiums for the sick, but raise them for the healthy.
"
797,AET,"The combination of the two can create a premium ""death spiral."" If young, healthy people refuse to buy coverage, the insurance pool gets older and sicker, and premiums climb still higher.
"
798,AET,"The GAO data support this. The lowest-cost plans in the six states with guaranteed issue and community rating rules average $1,703 a year. But in the 44 states without these rules, the cheapest plans average only $615.
"
799,AET,"Two states — Kentucky and New Hampshire — abandoned these market regulations precisely because of this death spiral. And in New York, these rules left the state with just thousands able to afford individual policies, down from more than 1 million who bought them in 1992.
"
800,AET,"The designers of ObamaCare say the individual mandate will prevent sky-high rates by forcing young and healthy people to buy coverage or pay a fine. But there's no guarantee this will work.
"
801,AET,"In Massachusetts, for example, which has both the ObamaCare market reforms and an individual mandate, the cheapest plan available today costs $2,564 a year, according to the GAO. That's higher than any other state in the country, and more than three times the national average.
"
802,AET,"And while Washington state has guaranteed issue and community rating rules but no individual mandate, ObamaCare will nevertheless push its premiums still higher. The cheapest ""bronze"" plan proposed for a 25-year-old would run $2,000 a year — which amounts to a 60% increase over what's available to a young person in that state today.
"
803,AET,"Plus, even ObamaCare backers say that the penalties for not complying with the mandate are likely to be too weak to work effectively, according to the Washington Examiner's Philip Klein — who was one of the few to pick up on the GAO report.
"
804,AET,"Klein notes that liberal economist Uwe Reinhardt called these low penalties a ""major design flaw in the law.""The average price for the lowest-cost ObamaCare ""bronze"" plan in eight states is 122% higher than the cheapest plan currently available in those states, according to an IBD analysis of rate filings and a recent Government Accountability Office report.The late July report, largely overlooked by the press, provides detailed information on insurance plans today in all 50 states, from the cheapest plans offered to a 30-year-old nonsmoker to the most expensive plans 55-year-old couples can buy.A separate report from the Maryland insurance department lists the lowest-cost ""bronze"" plans proposed for ObamaCare exchanges in eight states.Comparing the two reveals a wide gulf between the cheapest plans available now and those that will be sold next year under ObamaCare.In Ohio, for example, the least expensive ""bronze"" plan for a 25-year-old will cost $1,956 a year. That's almost three times higher than the cheapest plan in that state today, and higher than even the median-priced plan in the state, according to the GAO report.In Virginia, the lowest ""bronze"" premium is $1,608 — which is 252% higher than the cheapest policy available today.And Maryland's least expensive ObamaCare plan will be 83% higher than the lowest-cost plan sold in that state this year.Aetna (AET) on Thursday pulled out of Maryland's exchange after state officials pressed it to lower its proposed rates by up to 29%.Subsidies, Benefits ToutedObamaCare backers point out that many people couldn't get these current low rates either because they aren't sold in their local area, or because of their health status.

828,AET,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the country's largest health insurer, will be the first of the ""Big 5"" to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts aren't expecting major surprises.They've already lowered their earnings estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.43, the consensus prior to the company's so-so Q3 results. But that would still be a gain of 17% over last year.In Q3, earnings just met views for $1.53 a share, up only 2% from the prior year. Revenue missed slightly, rising 12% to $30.6 billion. Revenue is seen climbing 8% in Q4, to nearly $31.1 billion.""The quarter is going to be pretty much in line, maybe a little higher than expected but not very much,"" said analyst David Windley of Jefferies & Co.Upside would likely come from stronger-than-expected results from UnitedHealth's OptumHealth, he says. In an investor day in early December, UnitedHealth said it expects ""exceptional"" growth from the health services business in 2014.Analysts will also be watching for commentary on the company's substantial Medicare Advantage business, the privately run version of the government's Medicare program, which has been impacted by reimbursement cuts.In a filing last week, Humana (HUM) said it expects gross sales and terminations for individual Medicare Advantage plans for 2014 to be ""meaningfully better"" than previously projected, resulting in Advantage membership gains in 2014.""UnitedHealth had taken the position that membership was more likely to be flattish and margin would be down some beginning in 2014,"" Windley said. ""So it will be interesting to watch if UnitedHealth's (Medicare Advantage) will also be better than expected.""He thinks the open enrollment period for this year will show higher numbers than expected.But Humana, in the same filing, increased its prior estimate regarding 2015 Medicare Advantage funding pressures from 4% to 5% to 6% to 7%, based on an update of medical cost trends from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Fidel upgraded UnitedHealth's stock last week to buy from hold, based on expectations for 2014, namely higher price increases than its peers and a more conservative approach to the public exchanges than its peers.UnitedHealth may be considered a bellwether in the health-insurance industry, but it's been a contrarian on ObamaCare. Unlike its peers, UnitedHealth is largely sitting out the public exchanges this year, participating in only a handful of state exchanges.That may turn out to be a wise move. In the same filing last week, Humana said it now expects the ""risk mix"" of members enrolling in the exchanges to be ""more adverse than previously expected,"" presumably meaning more older, sicker enrollees than ""young invincibles.""Deutsche Bank downgraded Humana to ""sell,"" noting it has the softest premium increases of its peer group. Humana will report Q4 results on Feb. 5, with Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI) following over the next two days.On Thursday, Credit Suisse upgraded Aetna to ""outperform"" on ""muted cost trends"" and synergies from its acquisition of Coventry Health Care last year.The other ""Big 5"" insurer, WellPoint (WLP), will report on Jan. 29.

845,AET,"Yet, as of March 25, when the final enrollment surge was still going strong, Washington Healthplanfinder reported paid and unpaid sign-ups of 192,000. That means the current paid-up enrollment is down more than 23% from the sign-up total that is apples-to-apples with other states' reports from April.
"

(Previously, the insurer said it expects exchange enrollment to end 2014 a little above 500,000.) That may be, in part, because the grace period lets people skip payments at year-end without any lapse in coverage.

901,AET," Medicaid-focused managed-care firm Centene is having its moment as states turn over Medicaid patients to managed-care firms.St. Louis-based Centene (CNC) has been expanding in Florida and Mississippi, and may get a lot bigger in Illinois next year.It already gets a big slice of Medicaid business from Texas.And Texas will likely hand over more business to Centene next year for a new pilot program for low-income ""dual eligibles"" — those on Medicare and Medicaid.Besides Texas, it could get new business from Michigan and South Carolina as they phase in similar programs, analysts say.""There's never been a better time to be in the Medicaid business,"" said Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach. ""You have a broader backdrop of states transitioning their higher-cost Medicaid populations into managed care.""Health-care reform has also been a positive for Centene, Wright says. ""Even in non-expansion states, we have seen growth in the overall Medicaid population because of awareness of those benefits becoming available,"" he said.Year For New EnrollmentsIn January, Centene began serving enrollees in health-insurance marketplaces in nine states.Centene's Medicaid business at the end of June covered 3.16 million members in 20 states, 23% more members than a year earlier.Centene took in $3.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 49% from the year-ago period. More than 75% of its membership during the quarter was Medicaid-related.Earnings rose 11% to 79 cents a share, despite higher costs associated with health reform and chronically ill cases.Revenue growth was due to a myriad of factors, the company said. It ticked off a list that included expansion in Florida, new business from a specialty pharma acquisition, a new contract in California, expansion in Ohio and health-insurance exchanges.As Centene has been on the move, so has its stock, which is up 40% this year.""The stock has gone up because they have executed well,"" said David Windley, an analyst with Jefferies. ""We have been cautious about the magnitude of the new business they've been adding in 2014. But so far, that caution has been unfounded.""Centene's strong second quarter was in stark contrast to WellCare Health Plans (WCG), which reported an unexpected seven-cent per-share loss and lowered its forecast for the year.Analysts blame WellCare's weak showing on company-specific issues such as recent management changes at the top.""Management changes can be very disruptive,"" said analyst Joseph France of Cantor Fitzgerald.Centene's management team is ""more experienced,"" he said. ""They have expanded rapidly into new markets without the disruptions we've seen at WellCare.""Centene was recently named Cantor Fitzgerald's ""top pick"" in managed care for 2014. Not only were Centene's Q2 results better than expected, ""we look for further upside as it rolls out in new markets over the next 12-18 months,"" France said in an August 25 note that singled out Centene.He says that Centene will likely become more involved in Illinois next year as the state expands its Medicaid population to put around half of total enrollees under managed care.Florida's Hot In Health CareFlorida's expanded Medicaid program will have an especially significant impact on Centene as it nearly doubles the number of Medicaid members in managed care this year, Wright says.That expansion about doubles Centene's revenue in Florida on an annual basis to over $1.5 billion, Wright says. ""It showed up a little in the second quarter, but you'll get more of an impact in the third quarter,"" he said.If Indiana further expands its Medicaid population into managed care, as it's considering, Centene could benefit there, too, Wright says. Centene already handles 200,500 members in Indiana.Texas is Centene's biggest state by far, accounting for 921,500 members as of June 30, or 29% of its total membership.Georgia was the next largest, with 373,000, followed by Florida, with 313,800. But unlike Georgia's modest growth, Florida's number was up 45% from a year earlier — and still growing over the summer.Texas has largely finished transitioning into managed care, Wright says. But next year's dual-eligible pilot will offer managed care firms new opportunities. Centene is a likely beneficiary since it has the largest share in managed care in Texas, Wright adds.Complex Conditions CoverageCentene has also been finding new revenue streams through acquisitions. Most notably was last year's buy of specialty pharma company AcariaHealth. AcariaHealth focuses on complex conditions and distributes high-cost medications such as hepatitis C drugs.AcariaHealth was largely why Centene's service revenue went from a little more than $100 million a quarter to more than $400 million a quarter, Wright says.Early this year, Centene bought a majority interest in U.S. Medical Management, an in-home health services firm focused on seriously ill patients. Centene said that the deal would add between $220 million and $240 million in annual revenue and two to five cents EPS in 2014, then 20-25 cents in 2015.A transaction in July with Community Health Solutions of America added around 200,000 Medicaid lives in Louisiana, noted France.For 2014, Centene expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.5 billion and per-share earnings of $3.70-$3.90. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast $16.2 billion in revenue, a 49% jump over 2013. They see earnings rising 33% to $3.83.Centene is the top-rated company in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Another big Medicaid player, Molina Healthcare (MOH), has a 73. Several highly rated managed-care names are more diversified. Aetna (AET) has a 94 rating, Cigna (CI) an 89 and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) an 86.
"
902,AET,"Monthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower-cost plans, according to a study released Monday by Avalere Health.After analyzing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the health care advisory firm estimated that average premiums would fall by 2% to $38.95, from $39.88 in 2014.As premiums decline, Avalere warns, Medicare Part D sponsors ""may be shifting more cost-sharing responsibilities to beneficiaries."" For example, the proportion of prescription drug plans with zero deductibles in 2015 will drop to 42% from 47% in 2014.In addition, Part D sponsors ""continue to move away"" from offering coverage in the drug-coverage gap, or donut hole, as the Affordable Care Act gradually closes the gap. Some 74% of such plans will not offer coverage of drugs in the gap next year, Avalere said.""While beneficiaries will welcome lower premiums, they will need to look at other facets of benefit design, including how their medications are covered, cost-sharing responsibilities and total out-of-pocket spending,"" stated Christine Harhaj, senior manager at Avalere.Avalere noted a wide variance among the top plans. For example, a consolidated plan from Aetna (AET), called Aetna Medicare Rx Saver, will reduce premiums by 31% to $24.46, while WellCare Health's (WCG) Classic plan will go up by 52% to $31.46.The two most expensive plans are Humana (HUM) Enhanced at $52.81, up 11% from 2014, and the AARP MedicareRx Preferred from UnitedHealth (UNH) at $50.15, up 16% over 2014, Avalere said. The latter plan is also the largest by number of enrollments, at nearly 3.8 million.Humana also has among two of the lowest-priced 2015 plans: the Humana Preferred Rx Plan at $26.40 and Humana's Wal-Mart (WMT) Rx Plan at $15.67.The second largest plan by enrollment (at nearly 2.5 million), SilverScript Choice, will see average premiums fall by 21% in 2015 to $23.16, Avalere said. SilverScript Choice is offered by SilverScript Insurance, a CVS Caremark company, part of CVS Health (CVS).Another plan from UnitedHealth, the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus, will have an average premium of $28, Avalere said.As for Medicare Advantage plans, Avalere found that the number of those plans will drop 3% amid continued government reimbursement cutbacks.

904,AET,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has made an initial investment in RxAdvance, which is a full-service pharmacy benefit manager (“PBM”).  This deal not only establishes a customer relationship between the two companies but is also a strategic investment for Centene.Inside the DealThe transaction aims at using RxAdvance’s best-in-class technology platform that would help Centene improve health outcomes and control administrative as well as medical costs related to drugs. Per the terms of the transaction, Centene can expand its equity investment in RxAdvance in the future.Through its Envolve division, Centene has been providing comprehensive and integrated specialty services for long, including pharmacy management services via its Envolve division. With the help of Envolve's clinical competencies and RxAdvance's Collaborative PBM Cloud platform, Centene will be able to deliver integrated, real-time and data-driven pharmacy management services.Centene’s management believes that the transformative partnership will enable the company to build its next generation pharmacy management solution.Why RxAdvance?RxAdvance is famous for its Collaborative PBM Cloud platform.  The cloud platform helps in the reduction of overall pharmacy costs and avoidable drug-impacted medical costs along with optimizing the specialty spend. RxAdvance's transparent and unique approach, combined with its disruptive technology is expected to facilitate Centene in further improvement of health outcomes for its members and other customers and also in bringing down the overall healthcare costs.Centene’s Inorganic GrowthCentene has been deploying capital in numerous acquisitions, mergers as well as alliances.  Its inorganic growth strategy aims at expanding the company’s markets and increasing its Medicaid membership. In March 2016, the company acquired Health Net, that substantially added to its top line.Price PerformanceCentene’s inorganic growth efforts have significantly boosted its top line. These efforts have also been appreciated by shareholders. Its shares have rallied 51% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s gain of 32%. The recent investment is likely to drive the shares higher.Pacts in the IndustryMergers and acquisitions have been a key driver for the U.S. healthcare space, lately. In fact, health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The recent announcement of the acquisition of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation point toward the growing trend of two industries of the healthcare sector coming together to provide comprehensive care in an amicable way.Zacks RankCentene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

905,AET,"Keeping in line with the projected time of completion of the Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its shareholders have voted in favor of the $69-billion acquisition of the health insurance giant. While the market is abuzz with this historically biggest healthcare deal nearing a step closer toward completion, investors are hesitant about its effectiveness.The deal surfaced when three corporate behemoths — Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase & co. (JPM  -  Free Report) — disclosed their plans to transform America’s healthcare landscape through their newly formed joint venture in the space. This is forcing investors to think that the deal is an attempt by the healthcare giants to hold on to their position.Supporting this, the former Aetna CEO John Rowe, in a CNBC report stated that both CVS Health and Aetna are trying to expand their footprint in healthcare with the entry of e-commerce and financial giants. According to him, “It's not quite explicit yet what they're planning on doing but whatever it is, it's scaring CVS.”Vision in Favor of the Deal — A Vertical Integration?According to CVS Health, with the closing of this consolidation, the combined company is expected to bring together two complementary businesses. This will lead to the creation of a new community-based open health care model that is user friendly and less expensive.Rowe and many other economists also opined that this merger has fair chances of passing the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article). Also, going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016.Blankenhorn, in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVS Health-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout are of the opinion that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view also underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the third-largest U.S. insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS Health drugstores to get the prescriptions filled through CVS Health’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries, resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the long term patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will, in fact, diminish competition in the sector leading to inflated prices.CVS Health and Aetna both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

906,AET,"Waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up the healthcare space this year that could change the landscape of healthcare business. This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The latest catalyst is the health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which has planned to acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion, including $15 billion in debt. The moves comes three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to buy the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), for $207 per share or $69 billion (read: 4 ETFs to Gain From CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Cigna shareholders will own approximately 64% of the combined company.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from sale of drugs to insurance cover. It would benefit consumers by bringing together the medical care and pharmacy benefits at one roof to improve treatments and lower costs.The combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS after it completes its merger with Aetna. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. The e-commerce giant recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) in order to curb medical costs for their employees.The transaction would result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after it closes. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The deal is expected to close by Dec 31, 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CI-ESRX deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 44 securities in its basket with Cigna and ESRX occupying the fourth and fifth position, accounting for over 5% share each. The fund has amassed $493.7 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 24,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Trump's 2019 Budget Blueprint: ETF Winners & Losers).SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (XHS  -  Free Report)The fund uses an equal-weight methodology to each security by tracking the S&P Health Care Services Select Industry Index. Holding 49 stocks in its basket, CI and ESRX account for 2% share each. The fund has accumulated $91.5 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 6,000 shares a day. Expense ratio comes in at 0.35%. The ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (FXH)This fund follows an AlphaDEX methodology and ranks stocks in the space on various growth and value factors, eliminating the bottom-ranked 25% of the stocks. This approach results in a basket of 73 stocks with ESRX and CI taking 2.4% and 1.4% share, respectively. Health care providers & services is the top sector with 38.4% allocation, followed by healthcare equipment (23.5%), and biotech (18.9%). This fund has AUM of $974.5 million in its asset base and trades in volume of around 85,000 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.62% annually. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)The most popular healthcare ETF, XLV follows the Health Care Select Sector Index. This fund manages nearly $15.8 billion in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of around 8.1 million shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.13% annually. In total, the fund holds 61 securities in its basket with CI and ESRX accounting for over 1% of the assets. Pharma takes the largest share at 31.7% from a sector look while healthcare providers and services, biotech, and healthcare equipment and supplies make up for a double-digit exposure each. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

907,AET,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) has announced that it will buy Express Scripts Holding Co., (ESRX  -  Free Report) a pharmacy benefits provider and other medical servcies.The deal, valued $67 billion, will be financed by a mix of cash and debt. It will be one of the biggest deals for Cigna. What’s in the Offing for Cigna?The deal is expected to be mutually beneficial, given that it would lead to a solid combination of Cigna’s strong position and expertise in the health benefits space with Express Scripts’ leading position in the pharmacy benefits market (PBM).This combined entity would create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drugs to insurance cover.The deal will add to Cigna’s scale and size and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies better. This would lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, enabling the company to share the savings in with its consumers by way of more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium, thus ultimately leading to market-share gains.    Odds of the deals getting a clearance from regulators seem high, as it will be a vertical integration. Last year, Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) was blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both companies had overlapping businesses. In a year’s time shares of the company have gained 28% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.2%.Growing Trend of Health Insures Catching up with PBMWith this deal, Cigna will be catching up with the growing bandwagon of health insurers tying up with pharmacy benefits mangers. The acquisition of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s leading health insurers, by pharmacy benefit major CVS Health Corp. is already underway. Another deal in the same vein was the takeover of Catamaran by health insurer leader UnitedHealth Group Inc., in 2015.  Pharmacy benefit managers work primarily for insurers and employers and seek to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and drugstores to reduce the pocket-pinch for consumers. This in turn lowers the medical cost for insurers.Moreover, insurers seek an attractive business opportunity in the PBM market, which largely benefits from an aging population, which depends largely on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above, which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts the continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Consolidation in HealthcareMost economists believe this coming together of two different industries in the healthcare sector will add a new dimension and might help in checking soaring costs.Moreover, necessitated by the need of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry, mergers and acquisitions (both horizontal and vertical) are common. No matter whether a company wishes to grow horizontally (expand in the existing business) or vertically (expand into new business), the most sought-after way is to acquire the best fit.  Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

912,AET,"The grocery and drug store industries are about to witness further consolidation with the country’s largest grocer Albertsons Companies proposing to buy the distressed drugstore retailer, Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report). This deal can be Albertsons’ and Rite Aid’s latest effort to dispel the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Though Rite Aid’s shares reacted positively to the news in the pre-market trading session on Feb 20, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 11.8% in the last two days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, Rite Aid has gained 19.5% in the last three months, against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.The DealPer the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares. For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. Consequently, Rite Aid shareholders will own about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Further, Albertsons’ shareholders will own nearly 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.Depending on the results of the cash election, Rite Aid is likely to be valued at $1.30-2.65 per share under the sale agreement. The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities. Albertsons’ proposal is backed by investments from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., along with Kimco Realty Corporation; Klaff Realty, L.P.; Lubert-Adler Partners, L.P. and Schottenstein Stores Corporation.Following the completion of the merger, the combined company will be steered by John Standley as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He is currently the Chairman and CEO of Rite Aid. Further, Albertsons’ current Chairman and CEO, Bob Miller will serve as the Chairman of the new company. With leadership from executives of both companies, the combined entity will have dual headquarters at Boise, Idaho and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The name for the new company will be decided as the transaction nears closure. Further, the new company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.Albertsons currently operates about 2,300 supermarket stores and nearly 1,800 pharmacies. Meanwhile, Rite Aid has 2,569 drug stores in operation, following the sale of 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) for $4.38 billion.Together, the new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger has been approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.Industry Background & Threat of AmazonMajority of the recent consolidation in the grocery and drugstore industries has been trying to fend off rising competition due to the entry of Amazon in these segments. While Amazon’s entry in the grocery industry was marked by the recent acquisition of Whole Foods, the company recently teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) forming a non-profit company providing healthcare solutions to its employees. This has perked up the drugstore industry’s concerns regarding the e-commerce giant’s entry in the healthcare business.Further, this threat comes at a time when the drug industry is dealing with challenges like weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. As the industry players look to cut down costs, the industry continues to witness soft traffic and sales at front-end stores for the last several years. The consequences of these challenges are clearly visible in Rite Aid’s tepid profits in the last two years.A few more instances of recent consolidation in the drugstore industry are CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018, as well as Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.More Stock News: This is Bigger Than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

914,AET,"Per a report in The Wall Street Journal, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is in early-stage talks to buy the remaining stake in the leading pharmaceutical services company, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report). Soon after the takeover rumor surfaced on Feb 12, shares of AmerisourceBergen gained 15.7% in after-hours trading and subsequently, closed with a 0.3% rise. However, the stock price of Walgreens remained unchanged.In this regard, we remind investors that the drugstore retailer and pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise already holds a 26% stake in AmerisourceBergen, which is part of their long-term strategic relationship, formed in 2013. That relationship comprises a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract with AmerisourceBergen.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote We believe, Walgreen’s latest decision to acquire AmerisourceBergen’s remaining stake, comes close on the heels of its rival CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) gigantic $69-billion acquisition deal of health insurer, Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report). According to a Reuters report, the Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen integration, similar to the CVS-Aetna deal, is likely to move toward a vertical consolidation, combining all members of a supply chain.This apart, some analysts believe that this move may be in response to Amazon’s latest decision to step into the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Notably, in December 2017, Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) had acquired pharmacy licenses in a dozen states.As far as the news revolving around Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen agreement is concerned, many market researchers view this takeover rumor to be strategic, although the companies themselves have remained silent on this speculative issue.Significantly, Walgreens has a market capitalization of $67.82 billion while the same for AmerisourceBergen remains at $19.65 billion.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

It has delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.6%. Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 3.7% backed by solid performance of its Retail segment. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Humana’s retail segment has been performing well over past many quarters driven by the company’s Medicare and Medicaid expansion initiatives.

The same trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well, putting pressure on margins.Humana’s Individual commercial membership has remained a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016.

919,AET,"In some market shaking news, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that they are partnering with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) to build a healthcare company in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.As a result, shares of health sector companies are sliding in intraday trading. Insurance players like Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) are all down between 2.5%-5.5%, while pharmacy giants CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) each dipped around 5%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) is down nearly 6% as well.The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce, and the future entity will not aim to make a profit, but instead focus on the technology that will provide “simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare.”Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long-term, and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third-party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line.“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.”Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that “Hard as [forming a new healthcare company] might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,” while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to “create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now—that so-called Amazon Effect—so this announcement is not entirely a surprise. The healthcare company is still in the “early planning” stages, though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

920,AET,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings of $1.25 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Earnings, however, declined 23% from the prior-year quarter.The decline in earnings was primarily due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in Aetna's Health Care segment and targeted investment spending on growth initiatives. These were to some extent offset by lower losses in the company’s individual commercial products.Weak RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $14.74 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.89 billion. Also, revenues compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of $15.72 billion. The downside was primarily due to lower premiums in Aetna's Health Care segment, including lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the Health Insurer Fee  (HIF) in 2017.Total expense ratio of 20.5% declined 240 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 4.8% decreased 160 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 49.4 million from 52.79 million in the year-ago quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteSegmental Performance UpdateHealth CareAdjusted revenues were $14.5 billion, down 4% year over year. The downside was due to lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, lower membership in Medicaid products and the temporary suspension of the HIF. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $662 million, down 31.3% year over year due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care costs estimates, higher targeted investment spending on Aetna's growth initiatives and the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017, partially offset by reduced losses in Aetna's individual commercial products.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) rose 220 basis points year over year to 84.3% due to deterioration in Commercial and Government benefit ratios.Group InsuranceDuring the fourth quarter, the company completed the sale of a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses.This sale adversely impacted the quarter’s revenues and pre-tax adjusted earnings of $237 million and $16 million, respectively, which were down 61.8% and 57%, respectively.Large Case PensionsAdjusted revenues came at $71 million, up 11% year over year led by higher premiums in fourth-quarter 2017.Financial PositionTotal assets were $55.1 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 20% year over year.Long-term debt declined 57% year over year to $8.2 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 37% of Dec 31, 2017 compared with 53.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Business UpdateDuring the quarter, the company sold a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. The sale is expected to result in an after-tax gain of approximately $710 million ($1.1 billion pretax).Also, Aetna entered into an agreement, in the quarter, to be acquired by CVS Health Corp.

921,AET,"Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries. Asian markets were down slightly overnight, and later this evening we await President Trump’s initial State of the Union address. Later this week, beginning tomorrow, we start to see new data on January jobs numbers.Keeping with Q4 earnings results, here are 4 leaders in their respective spaces and how well they have performed relative to expectations, particularly the Zacks consensus estimates:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted strong quarterly numbers both on top- and bottom-lines ahead of the opening bell today. Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%. In the quarter just reported, McDonald’s benefited from stronger comps, up 5.5% year over year. For more on MCD’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma player Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on both earnings and revenues, with 62 cents per share on $13.70 billion in sales topping the 56 cents and $13.61 billion expected, respectively. Earnings growth year over year was a nice 32%, while revenues were up 1%. Revenue guidance for full-year 2018 remains in range of the current Zacks consensus estimate, whereas earnings guidance of between $2.90-3.00 per share is out ahead of the $2.77 we had earlier expected. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.Health insurance major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), on the other hand, posted mixed results for its Q4, with $1.23 per share surpassing the $1.18 we were looking for, but revenues of $14.74 billion lower than the $14.89 billion expected, and down further from the $15.72 billion a year ago. Enrollment is down as Congress continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which was good for Aetna: the previous 4 quarters generated an average 23% positive earnings surprise. For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T.

922,AET,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.7%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.7%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in gaining new and retaining existing customers. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.In this regard, we are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM selling season, reflecting solid progress from last quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract loss but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteHowever, increased generic dispensing and price compression have been partially offsetting growth in this space. Moreover, there are several timing factors that have affected the cadence of profit delivery last quarter. One such aspect was the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business. Per the company, the same is expected to continue through the fourth-quarter as well.Largely due to weaker margin performance in the PBM client and retail network claims administration process, CVS Health now expects adjusted operating profit growth in mid-teens at the Pharmacy Services segment for fourth-quarter 2017 and around 4% for full-year 2017.Apart from the timing of Medicare Part D profitability, the company expects higher benefits from the streamlining initiatives in the back half of the year. Taking that into consideration, the company projected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share and consolidated operating profit growth at the low end of the $1.88-$1.92 and 5.75-8% range, respectively.Here are some other factors that might also influence CVS Health’s fourth-quarter results:The company maintains fourth-quarter operating loss projection for its Retail/LTC segment at the low end of the 1.0% to 3.5% range, largely due to restricted network changes. Notably, the decision to restrict CVS Health from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks have continued to affect Pharmacy sales and script comps. Moreover, total same-store sales are expected to decline 1-2.8% in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, the company has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of last July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company is planning to collaborate with PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health.

923,AET,"Tuesday, January 30, 2018Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries. Asian markets were down slightly overnight, and later this evening we await President Trump’s initial State of the Union address. Later this week, beginning tomorrow, we start to see new data on January jobs numbers.Keeping with Q4 earnings results, here are 4 leaders in their respective spaces and how well they have performed relative to expectations, particularly the Zacks consensus estimates:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted strong quarterly numbers both on top- and bottom-lines ahead of the opening bell today. Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%. In the quarter just reported, McDonald’s benefited from stronger comps, up 5.5% year over year. For more on MCD’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma player Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on both earnings and revenues, with 62 cents per share on $13.70 billion in sales topping the 56 cents and $13.61 billion expected, respectively. Earnings growth year over year was a nice 32%, while revenues were up 1%. Revenue guidance for full-year 2018 remains in range of the current Zacks consensus estimate, whereas earnings guidance of between $2.90-3.00 per share is out ahead of the $2.77 we had earlier expected. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.Health insurance major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), on the other hand, posted mixed results for its Q4, with $1.23 per share surpassing the $1.18 we were looking for, but revenues of $14.74 billion lower than the $14.89 billion expected, and down further from the $15.72 billion a year ago. Enrollment is down as Congress continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which was good for Aetna: the previous 4 quarters generated an average 23% positive earnings surprise. For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also posted earnings and revenue beats for its Q4 report: $1.52 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, while the $1.29 billion in revenues did better than the $1.27 billion estimated and the $1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter.

924,AET,"Have you been eager to see how Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) performed in Q4 in comparison with the market expectations? Let’s quickly scan through the key facts from this Hartford -based major health insurer’s earnings release this morning:An Earnings BeatAetna came out with earnings of $1.25 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Earnings, however, declined 23% over the prior year quarter.The year-over-year decline in earnings was primarily due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care costs estimates in Aetna's Health Care segment and targeted investment spending on the company’s growth initiatives. These were to some extent offset by, lower losses in the company’s individual commercial products.Earnings Surprise HistoryAetna has an impressive earnings surprise history.

The company’s fully insured and self-funded memberships have boosted the total enrollment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $22.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 3%.Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion has also significantly boosted the company’s medical enrollment.

926,AET,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 30, is expected to witness a decline in revenues due to lower premiums in its Health Care segment, including lower membership in its ACA compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the health insurer fee (HIF) in 2017.        Revenues from Health Care segment is expected to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter owing to the sale of its domestic life insurance group, group disability insurance and absence management business lines; the previously disclosed Medicaid contract termination; exits from individual Commercial products and continued repositioning of its ACA-compliant small group Commercial products. Management has also reduced its 2017 revenue guidance to approximately $60.5 billion from $61 billion earlier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Health Care segment for the fourth quarter is $14.5 billion, down 3.7% year over year. Medical Benefit Ratio, a metric used to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, led by an unfavorable performance of Individual Commercial products.The company projects an increase in the medical benefit ratio, driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee and experience rating pressure in the company's Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in its Individual Commercial Insured products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 85%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.18 million, down 4% year over year. We expect medical membership to suffer from declines in the company’s ACA-compliant individual and small group, and Medicaid products. The decrease should be partially offset by increases in its Commercial ASC, International Commercial Insured and Medicare Insured products.The company's focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses.Share repurchases made by the company in the fourth quarter will help to lift its earnings.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 23.1%. This is depicted in the chart below:Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc.

927,AET,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are scheduled to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Medical Sector TrendsThe medical sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S. healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicaid expansion under ACA. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, expansion into ancillary businesses, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position are expected to add to the top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. In addition, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were also a drag. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks — Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) — that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Jan 30, before the market opens.Aetna is an American managed health care company, engaged in selling traditional and consumer-directed health care insurance plans and related services. It is expected to be acquired by CVS Health in the second half of 2018, per a definitive merger agreement. On the other hand, HCA Healthcare, through its subsidiaries, provides health care services in the United States and England.Here are some companies from the medical sector that are likely to beat on earnings in the fourth quarter.Centene Corp.

Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteQ4 Expectations From HCA HealthcareThe company’s revenues have been rising over the past few years on the back of accretive acquisition of other hospitals.  Continuing the trend, patient admissions are expected to grow further in the fourth quarter, driving the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (representing the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 497,000, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for in patient revenues per admission is pegged at $13,433, up 2.5% year over year.The company has been deploying capital in terms of share repurchases to enhance investors’ value. Share buyback programs taken up during the fourth quarter are likely to favor the bottom line, limiting the share count.However, the company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to suffer from the industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.Operating expenses per equivalent admission are also likely to increase in the fourth quarter with a rise in admissions.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because, despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -0.20% makes the prediction inconclusive.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc.

929,AET,"The health insurers had a solid run last year thanks to increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position.  All these led to top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.  2018 Looks Promising Despite continued uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry is expected to continue performing well in 2018.  We see potential for sustained growth in expanding government programs. Increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions will keep the industry’s growth trend alive.A Top Ranked IndustryThe health insurance industry therefore looks attractive from an investment perspective. The Medical HMO carries a Zacks Industry Rank #24 (top 9% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Here we focus on two top health insurers, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report).Anthem is one of the largest publicly-traded managed care organizations in terms of membership with market capitalization of $58.33 billion. On the other hand, Aetna, with market capitalization of $58.24 billion, is an American managed health care company, engaged in selling traditional and consumer directed health care insurance plans and related services. It is expected to be acquired by CVS Health in the second half of 2018, per a definitive merger agreement.It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some top-ranked stocks in the industry are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks RankWhile Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Anthem has an edge with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).VGM ScoreBoth Aetna and Anthem have a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors. Both of the companies score equally on this ground.Price PerformanceBoth the companies have outperformed the industry in a year. While shares of Anthem have rallied 61.5%, Aetna stock has surged 50.6%. Here, Anthem performs better than Aetna.ValuationThe price-to-earnings (P/E) value metric is the best multiple used for valuing health insurers. Compared with the industry’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 21.7, both Anthem and Aetna are undervalued. Yet, with a trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 18, Aetna is relatively cheaper than Anthem’s trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 19.2. This round clearly goes to Aetna.Moreover, the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio also remains biased toward Aetna. Aetna has a trailing 12-month PEG ratio of 1.60 while Anthem has the same of 1.69. However, both look overpriced when compared to the industry average of 1.50.  Dividend YieldBoth Anthem and Aetna have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholders’ value. They also maintain a record of raising dividends at regular intervals.Anthem has a current dividend yield of 1.17% and a five-year growth rate of 21.1%, while Aetna has a dividend yield of 1.09% and a five-year growth rate of 9.9%.Both the stocks’ dividend yield is higher than the industry’s average of 1.07%. Comparatively, Anthem has an edge over Aetna here.Leverage Ratio Both Anthem and Aetna have higher debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 58.5. However, Anthem, with a leverage ratio of 59.4, has an edge over Aetna with the same of 64.2.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a comprehensive earnings history, both Anthem and Aetna delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While Anthem has an average earnings surprise of 11.5%, Aetna stands out with an average earnings surprise of 23.1%.Hence, Aetna scores over Anthem in this context.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsAnthem has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward by 0.02%, over the last 60 days. On the other hand, the same for Aetna has moved upward for 2018 by 1.1%, over the same time frame.For Anthem, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.21 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 10.4%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.7%.For Aetna, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $10.23 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.2%.This round is slightly biased toward Aetna.ConclusionAnthem is poised better than Aetna when considering rank, price performance, leverage ratio and dividend yield.  However, Aetna wins on valuation, earnings surprise history and earnings estimate revisions & growth projections.Our comparative analysis shows that Anthem presently has an advantage over Aetna and is a better investment option.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

930,AET,"Shares of CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) rose 2.64% in the last trading session to close at $75.13, following the company’s announcement of a promising 2018 earnings outlook.Per management, banking on solid growth in scripts and claims, increasing purchasing power due to the Red Oak venture, and rising net benefits from the company's reorganization initiative, CVS Health expects to witness net revenue growth in the range of 0.75-2.5% for full-year 2018. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $192.07 billion, which signifies growth of 4.4% year over year.Segment Wise OutlookCVS Health has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. Notably, it has been expanding partnerships with PBMs and health plans, and increasing participation as a preferred pharmacy in a larger number of Medicare Part D networks. Thus, for 2018, the company projects revenue growth in the range of 2.5-4% in this space, led by growth of 6-7% in the same store script. Moreover, CVS Health estimates same store sales to vary in the range of 2-3.5%.CVS Health expects to witness revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% in the Pharmacy Services segment with growth of roughly 8%. However, management of rebates for Aetna’s Medicare Part D business, a projected rise in generic specialty introductions, prevalent pricing pressures and decreased levels of brand inflation are expected to adversely impact this segment in 2018.2018 Operating Profit ForecastThis leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care expects adjusted consolidated operating profit growth in the band of 1-4% in 2018. Notably, the company expects to record low-single digit adjusted operating profit growth in Retail/ Long Term Care (LTC) segment, along with a low- to mid-single digit growth in the Pharmacy Services business.However, the operating profit growth in 2018 might be adversely impacted by around 125 basis points (bps) due to the costs associated with the following two deals inked by the company of late —To begin with, the company’s divestiture of the provider of tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers — RxCrossroads — to McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) for a cash deal valued around $735 million. Secondly, the company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. to provide services, including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.However, this guidance assumes the company’s major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) acquisition deal to close at the end of 2018 instead of the second half, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. Thus, all the takeover-related expenses will not be included in the company's adjusted figures.Notably, during the announcement of this $69-billion deal, the company projected $750 million of near-term synergies, with low- to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction. Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation Quote Benefits from the Latest U.S. Tax ReformThe latest U.S. tax legislation, which slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, is anticipated to benefit the company with an effective tax rate of 27% and an increased cash flow of around $1.2 billion in 2018.Revised Outlook for Q4CVS Health now expects to report a mid-teens Pharmacy Services segment's adjusted operating profit growth rate in fourth-quarter 2017 and around 4% for full-year 2017, largely due to weaker margin performance in the PBM client and retail network claims administration process. However, the company still expects fourth-quarter operating loss from its Retail/LTC segment to be at the lower end of the previously-provided range of 1.0% to 3.5%. Also, the company estimates adjusted EPS and consolidated operating profit growth at the low end of the previously-provided ranges of $1.88-$1.92 and 5.75-8%, respectively.Zacks Rank and Key PickCVS Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25% and has gained 32.5% over the past year.

931,AET,"Investors in Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 5, 2018 $130 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Aetna shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Aetna is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - HMOs industry that ranks in the Top 4% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have revised their estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.22 per share to $1.18 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Aetna right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

932,AET,"There is no doubt that 2017 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in the history of U.S. stock trading. The market touched more than 60 daily all-time highs, and the S&P 500 closed higher in every single month for the first time in history. That hot streaked has continued into the first days of the New Year, with our major indexes once again surging to new peaks in 2018.Another trend we have also seen move into 2018 is speculation over major mergers and acquisitions. Total M&A activity was actually relatively quiet in 2017—deals were down about 35% through mid-November—but several Wall Street titans either announced major deals or found themselves at the center of deal-related rumors throughout the year.From industry-shifting moves like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout of Whole Foods and CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) tie-up with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), to future-focused acquisitions like Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) purchase of CAR-T researcher Kite Pharma and Intel’s INTC deal to buy computer vision firm Mobileye, 2017 had plenty of huge M&A headlines to soak in (also read: 15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017).And so far in 2018, the headlines have continued. The entertainment industry is still reacting to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) acquisition of several major 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, and giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) have already caused the rumor mill to swirl.With this in mind, let’s take a look a three huge M&A deals that might happen this year:1.       Apple (Finally) Buying NetflixPeople have been arguing that Apple should use its massive cash pile to make a major media acquisition for years now, and video streaming giant Netflix is typically the first choice among speculators.But Apple has defied these speculators time and time again, opting instead to invest in itself. Indeed, the company recently promised $1 billion to its Apple Music division for the purposes of building out original video content, and its first in-house produced shows are starting to debut now.However, the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, could be the catalyst needed to inspire a major Apple deal.Earlier this week, shares of Netflix surged after a note on this very topic from Citigroup analysts emerged. The firm’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that Apple is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company. The analysts suggested that there is as high as a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix soon.But is Apple even interested in the company, or will its attention turn elsewhere? 2.       Amazon Targets… Target?As if Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods was not enough to satisfy the retail deal rumors, the latest batch of industry whispers point to the e-commerce king going after big-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report).The rumors were sparked by Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster, who recently published a report highlighting eight predictions for the technology industry this year.“Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,” Munster argued. “Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy.”Amazon burned a lot of its cash with its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, but if the financials work out, Target certainly makes sense within the context of the online retailer’s ongoing war with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, another brick-and-mortar acquisition could be a lofty move for the e-commerce company, especially considering how fresh the Whole Foods deal is. Can the internet giant really adapt to traditional retail that quickly? 3.       Time Warner and Comcast Snatch HuluAs mentioned, the entertainment industry is still figuring out what to do next after Disney decided to shell out more than $50 billion in stock for many of Fox’s most important assets. Disney has certainly beefed up the library for its upcoming streaming services, and ESPN’s grasp on the sports world is even tighter with the acquisition of Fox Sports Regional Networks.But one thing that remains unclear is the fate of Hulu, a budding video streaming platform co-owned by Fox, Disney, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and Time Warner . Disney bought Fox’s 30% stake in the brand, giving it a controlling 60% stake, but it is unlikely that Comcast and Time Warner will give up on the promising streaming platform just yet.Comcast still owns 30% of Hulu, and through its NBCUniversal subsidiary, it could certainly whip up a Hulu-NBC-Universal streaming service that could compete with Disney and Netflix. Teaming up with Time Warner and its HBO division could add even more firing power.Of course, we have yet to see any indication that Disney is looking to shed its new controlling stake in Hulu, but one would imagine that it could become a bargaining tool in what is sure to be a complicated regulatory approval process.With Netflix, Disney, and Amazon poised to be video streaming leaders in five years’ time, might Comcast and Time Warner look to toss a fourth hat into the ring? Want more stock market analysis from this author?

933,AET,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 4.Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management, the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90-day at retail (one prescription that is equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Moreover, the company expects these factors to affect first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Moreover, collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) raise caution.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters. To counter competition, Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern. In this regard, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to fend off competition.Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges.In this regard, the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third-party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks. Notably, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots, as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies in the United States.Per management, the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30-day prescriptions. However, it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs. It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency. The company’s U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, also bodes well. Notably, as of Aug 31, 2017, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million.Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) stores. While the transition process of these stores is underway, the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018. Notably, Walgreens Boots has purchased 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.Although the deal is not going to impact the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results, a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018. In this regard, the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial value is quite attractive. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years. This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C. However, to achieve the desired results, the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings in first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of +3.97%.

934,AET,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) is a provider of healthcare services through general hospitals and related healthcare facilities. The company has significantly grown inorganically over past many years. It has expanded scale of business, boosted operating capacity and geographical presence through numerous acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances. It has also joined forces with companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, Cigna Corp (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana, Centene and many more.Apart from buyouts, the company has been divesting its non-core and unprofitable business units to repay its debt and maintain financial liquidity. In December 2017, the company disclosed its intention to put up its Conifer segment for sale to offer quality health solutions to its clients including its own hospitals and maximize shareholders’ value.Tenet Healthcare is undertaking cost reduction initiatives to lower annual operating expenses by $250 million, with annualized run-rate savings to be achieved by 2018 end. Nearly 75% of the savings are likely to be achieved from actions within the company’s hospital operations and other segment. During the first nine months of 2017, the company’s total operating expenses decreased 1.5% year over year.Tenet Healthcare’s board is going through a reshuffle since Aug 31, 2017 for ensuring the right mix of opinions, skills and experience aimed at enhancing value of the company. To date, three new independent directors with significant healthcare, financial and operational expertise have been appointed. The board will continue its search for additional independent directors who can further enhance its expertise.In a year's time, shares of Tenet Healthcare have lost 1.6%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 6.4%. However, the company’s relentless efforts to create value for investors and other fundamentals are likely to favor the stock going forward. Notably, the stock has a Value Score of A.However, the company’s top line has been declining over the last two quarters due to reduced admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits. These can be attributed to the high deductible plans that result in more out-of-pocket expenses of the patients.Another headwind for the company is its rising level of debt. This has led to a rise in interest expenses which, in turn, weighs on the bottom line.Zacks RankTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

935,AET,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can’t help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC, and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.1. Amazon Buys Whole FoodsEarlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.2. Intel Acquires MobileyeIntel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell CollinsIn a major industry deal, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.4. Disney To Buy Some of 21st Century Fox’s AssetsJust a few weeks ago, Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse’s parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate’s assets, including the film studio 20th Century Fox, the company’s TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA’s stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.5. JAB Holdings Acquires PaneraFor $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo“Affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. This likely won’t be Kors’ last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, “luxury group.”7. Coach Buys Kate SpadeCoach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR, shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers—it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez—and to rebrand itself as a broader “lifestyle assortment company.”8. CVS Buys AetnaAfter weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.9. Gilead Acquires Kite PharmaIn October, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoftIn a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub “the future of work,” as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.11. Apple Buys ShazamRecently, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app’s augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.12. Arby’s Roark Buys Buffalo Wild WingsJust last month, Arby’s owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby’s has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby’s will also assume the debt of BWLD.13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines–based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Shape, among others, while Time owns Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks InteractiveIn November, Discovery’s (DISCA  -  Free Report) $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive  received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp’s portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone TeamThis fall, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC’s mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC’s team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

936,AET,"A wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has signed a definitive purchase agreement and is set to launch a tender offer for Empresas Banmédica — an initial step toward acquiring the Chilean company.The deal, valued at nearly $2.8 billion, will enhance UnitedHealth’s footprint in South America. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary terms and conditions.UnitedHealth already has a presence in South America, backed by its acquisition of Amil Participacoes SA in 2012, which made the former an operator of hospitals and clinics in Brazil.The above-mentioned deal will likely be beneficial for UnitedHealth, given Banmedica’s 25-year expertise in Latin America with the largest private health groups in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Further, this acquisition will boost UnitedHealth’s international operations.Diversifying geographically is one of the crucial long-term growth strategies of the company at a time when stringent and uncertain regulations are adversely impacting the U.S. healthcare industry.  Pressure on profit margins in the U.S. market has compelled American health insurers to target foreign markets for continued growth and profitability, since these markets are less penetrated and offer more competition. Notably, Asia and Europe provide the best near-term opportunities for U.S. health insurers.Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deals, followed by Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc. (HUM). These deals are either mergers and acquisitions, or joint ventures with local insurance companies.Some of the deals made by the players in this field reflect the emerging trend of globalization.  Recently, Aetna acquired U.K.-based Bupa Group’s Thai business — Bupa Thailand — which will significantly fortify the presence of the former in Asia. Earlier, it had bought U.K.-based company, InterGlobal, which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe.Another insurer, Cigna, operates in India through a joint venture with TTK Group.Notably, UnitedHealth seems focused on achieving fast-paced growth and mergers and acquisitions remain its top priority. In 2017, the company made a number of acquisitions in its health services segment — Optum. The latest deal includes the buyout of DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — which was announced early this month.Expansion of the Optum segment remains one of its primary goals, followed by growth of international operations.In last six months, the stock has gained 20%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18%.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

937,AET,"Health insurer Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to acquire Kindred-at-Home, a unit of Kindred Healthcare Inc.Details of the DealTPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Humana have formed a joint venture to buy Kindred for nearly $4.1 billion including the acquired company’s debt. Humana will occupy a 40% stake for $800 million in Kindred-at-Home, which will be separated from the rest of the company after the deal. The transaction will see light by the summer of 2018 and will be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings per share in 2019 and beyond.Essence of the Deal for HumanaThe deal will provide a vertical integration for Humana and aligns with the company’s strategy to grow in the home healthcare arena. The deal will allow the company to provide an improved care to patients at low cost.This transaction will provide Humana with an extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with Humana’s individual Medicare Advantage membership. The company will also have full access to extensive clinical capabilities to better serve its members.A deal of this kind comes as no surprise to us given that the company had kept its eyes wide open for such attractive acquisitions after its failed merger with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) earlier in the year. The company’s balance sheet with strong financial flexibility also provides enough support for capital deployment activities.Last week, the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program to buy back its common stock worth up to $3 billion.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has rallied 21%, significantly underperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Nonetheless, the recent announcement, a well-poised Medicare business as its solid balance sheet should drive the shares higher.Industry TrendA spate of similar deals is witnessed in the industry of late, driven by the increasing trend of health insurers foraying into patient-care business. The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna aims to dispense affordable cure to patients at their convenience closer home or at an outpatient location.Further competition is lent by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Recently, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group along with its clinics and urgent care centers.The central tenet for all these deals is to cut costs and improve care. These developments mark the coming forward of health insurers to play a more direct role in providing actual medical services and move beyond offering insurance.These deals seeking to reduce hospitalizations, lower emergency room visits and allowing physicians and clinicians to extend their care all the way to a patient’s home are, however, detrimental to hospital companies’ business and survival.Going ForwardThe ripple of shakeup in the health care industry started by CVS-Aetna deal continues to trend higher. One after another player continues to join the bandwagon of consolidation. Given the urgent need (in the rapidly-transforming health care industry) for increase in heft and size, restraint of sky-high medical costs plus diversification of business, we won’t be surprised if we hear more of deals along similar lines going forward.Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

938,AET,"“America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world.” – Rep. Bill FristIn terms of market size, the U.S. health care market is the largest in the world. A report by Health Access suggests that America’s unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services and equipment, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge.Further, the markets got a boost after President Donald Trump — an ardent proponent of “living big, living large” — came into power. His constant efforts to boost American lifestyle, focus on middle class and incorporate the best health care in America have been creating a stir.Trump’s efforts to eliminate the country’s jobless stature are remarkable. Per reports, the U.S. unemployment rate was pegged at 4.1% in November, the lowest since February 2001. Undoubtedly, Trump’s “America first!” pitch has been driving employment growth like never before.Four Factors to Drive MedTech in 2018Increasing Consolidation in HealthcareThe latest trend of increasing consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition as well as increasing barriers of entry in the industry. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers and consumers.The recent $69-billion deal between Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a significant example. It qualifies as vertical integration, which will enable the newly formed entity to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.President Trump’s Focus on Emerging MarketsPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging market revenues, which is less than a quarter of MedTech’s global revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third by 2022.Thus, the United States' trade plans with emerging countries are likely to favor the domestic companies.In this regard, investors may find President Trump’s 12-day Asia trip last month interesting. The visit was aimed at boosting inter-country trade relations, particularly with the emerging nations. Trump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. He also emphasized “free and open Indo-Pacific trade” with a focus on the nations of Japan, Australia and India.IVD & PBM Markets to Thrive A research report by EvaluateMedTech World Preview indicates that global MedTech sales are expected to witness a CAGR of 5.1% to $522 billion by 2022, with IVD (in Vitro diagnosis) raking in annual sales of $69.6 billion at a CAGR of 5.9%. Increasing investments from government and private players in the form of reimbursement coverage and speedy patent approvals are driving demand.The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. PBMs manage pharmaceutical spending and enhance health benefits for end users. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the global PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019. Investing in PBM stocks can be a prudent move for registering solid gains in 2018. Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model.For example, MedTech major Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Picking the Right StocksBased on certain parameters, we have selected six MedTech growth stocks which are poised for impressive returns in 2017.

939,AET,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industryover the past six months. The stock has lost 10.6% compared with the industry’s 12.5% decline.We are upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business which has been gaining on strength in Specialty Pharmacy. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is top priority for customers. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, which include Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.  We are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, with solid progress in the last reported quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the loss of the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. The company has already completed about 90% of client renewals for 2018.We are encouraged by the company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) — in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. On the deal’s successful completion, CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that allows it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, the highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a concern. Precisely, the company faces stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments. Discount retailers, in particular, have made substantial inroads in gaining market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in recent past. Per the company, the decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). Notably, PetMed and Align Technology sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PetMed has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. The stock has rallied roughly 94.1% over a year.Align Technology has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 28.9%. The stock has gained 136.1% in a year.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

"
940,AET,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report).Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to counter competition.3 Stocks to Scoop UpAs the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.CVS Health: Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS’ PBM customers.CVS Health Corporation Price CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteExpress Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.Notably, the company’s PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider — eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.Express Scripts Holding Company Price Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteRite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report): Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.Notably, the company’s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.Rite Aid Corporation Price Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteBottom LineAlthough these companies have solid prospects, they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations, reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

941,AET,"The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) announced recently has sent jitters across the hospital sector, which is already suffering from low patient volumes, soaring costs, increasing bad debts, and an uncertain regulatory climate among other issues.Increasing EncroachmentThe deal between a health insurer, Aetna and a pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy store company, CVS Health, is expected to eat into the business of hospital companies. The companies aim to bring affordable cure to patients at increased convenience. This implies greater emphasis on value-based care rather than fee for service care.The players are structuring their offerings in a way that should keep patients away from hospitals. In this regard, they are being provided necessary services at home or an outpatient location. This should shift patient traffic for emergency rooms away from hospitals.“The overuse of emergency department adds an estimated $38 billion in wasteful spending every year, so tremendous savings can be realized by utilizing local care solutions in a more integrated fashion,” according to Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini.Further competition is being posed by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Last week, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group and its clinics and urgent care centers.The expansion of UnitedHealth and CVS Health in outpatient facilities is likely to create challenges for big names in the hospital industry such as Tenet Healthcare, HCA Holdings and Community Health Systems. The country’s nonprofit hospital industry may also not be spared.The industry underperformed the S&P 500 index last year, as evident by growth of just 2.8% compared with a rally of 20% by the former.Recourse Being TakenPlayers in the hospital industry are coming together to gain in scale and size to face growing invasion. According to a Wall Street Journal report, hospital operators Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are mulling to merge which should create the nation’s largest hospital chain.Two major Midwestern hospital operators, Advocate Health Care and Aurora Health Care, are combining to lead cost-effective operations. Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health are merging, bringing together 139 hospitals and projecting combined revenues of $28.4 billion.Consolidation is the Name of the GameConsolidation in the hospital industry is already rampant, driven by the increased need by players to build scale and new capabilities, increase service offerings, and expand geographically to find a solid footing in an uncertain healthcare environment.According to the latest analysis by Kaufman Hall, a leading provider of strategic and financial consulting services, hospital and health system partnership transactions for 2017 were total 87 as of the end of the third quarter, implying that transactions may exceed 102 deals completed in 2016. Last quarter, 29 transactions were announced, slightly less than 31 deals announced in the second quarter.With the trend not likely to see any reversal anytime soon, we expect further deals down the line.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

943,AET,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum unit has announced the buyout of DaVita Medical Group, a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), for $4.9 billion in cash.This acquisition will be made by OptumCare — a sub-segment of Optum — the company’s health services segment. OptumCare provides primary and urgent care delivery services business.This is the company’s third deal this year to expand its medical services business. It is expected to close in 2018. In March, the unit bought Surgical Care Affiliates for about $2.3 billion. Last month, Optum also bought the health unit of Advisory Board Co., which advises hospital systems.The company is on an acquisition spree to build its Optum segment gradually. In this regard, the Catamaran and the MedExpress buyout in 2015 are worth mentioning.The expansion of this segment, which complements its core health benefits business under UnitedHealthcare, should poise the company strongly for growth in an increasingly regulated market.In the last year, shares of UnitedHealth have gained 38%, in line with the industry's growth it belongs to.UnitedHealth has been continuously adding related businesses to transform itself from just an insurance company to a comprehensive healthcare provider. The company will now offer a bouquet of services that include selling of health insurance coverage to pharmacy benefit management to improve physician practices.This transformation is also necessitated by the company’s need to control soaring medical costs to protect margins. Getting vertically integrated, better equips the company to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Meanwhile, an increasing trend of vertical consolidation is being witnessed across the industry, which is itself undergoing rapid transformation owing to heightened regulation, soaring medical costs, increased consumerism, shift to value based care.Another deal in the same vein is that of the buyout of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which would enable the surviving company to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.We strongly believe consolidation in the sector to continue, which would lead to more deals of this kind going forward.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

944,AET,"The healthcare sector has been under the spotlight for quite some time for a host of reasons —regulatory uncertainty, increasing consumerism and consolidation being the most prominent.The recent deal of merger between two of the industry stalwarts Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and CVS Health, once again points to increased activity in healthcare. The deal also testifies to the trend of joining two branches of the industry, in this case health insurance and pharmacy benefit management, to achieving diversification and economies of scale for affordable and convenient care.Increasing Consolidation in HealthcareChanging demographics, increasing regulatory restrictions, growing consumerism, need to control cost and attain speedier growth have necessitated unprecedented mergers and acquisitions in all subsectors of healthcare like hospitals, insurance and pharmaceutical.The changing nature of the healthcare industry has encouraged companies to spread their operations so as to provide a bouquet of products and services and save cost at each touchpoint. The recent deal between Aetna and CVS Health is an excellent example of this. It qualifies as vertical integration, which would enable the surviving company to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.A similar deal was made in 2015, when another insurance major UnitedHealth Group acquired Catamaran, a pharmacy benefit management company. The acquisition has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth Group and contributed meaningfully to its results.Changing demographics, which has resulted in an increase in the baby boomer population, which has fueled demand for Government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, has also led to a number of mega mergers in the industry in recent years. The failed mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Humana Inc. with Aetna Inc. also belonged to this bracket.Who Is the Real Gainer?Increasing consolidation has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition, and increasing barriers of entry in the industry.Though there’s a bit of ambiguity as to whether increasing consolidation has brought about welfare (in real terms) for consumers. However, the companies certainly stand to benefit from their increased size, putting them in a powerful position to negotiate with suppliers and consumers.U.S. healthcare is a highly sensitive issue that has been gaining huge attention. Healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs, a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve. Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs.Attractive Stocks to PickWe therefore point out some stocks in the space that carry a strong Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and have outperformed the industry’s decline of 0.6% so far this year.

945,AET,"On Wednesday, only a few days after the CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal helped shine a light on the quickly changing healthcare industry, UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) for nearly $5 billion.UnitedHealth, the country’s biggest health insurer, announced that its Optum division reached an agreement to acquire DaVita Medical Group for roughly $4.9 billion in cash. This deal, which is expected to close in 2018, is aimed to help expand UnitedHealth’s primary and urgent care services.UnitedHealth hopes to pair DaVita Medical Group’s 300 medical clinics, 35 urgent-care centers, and six outpatient surgery centers—which reach around 1.7 million patients a year—with Optum’s massive insurance division.“Combining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways while working with more than 300 health care payers across Optum in ways that better meet the needs of their members,” Optum CEO Larry C. Renfro said in a statement.Optum also runs its own primary and urgent care centers, surgery centers, and senior and advanced care centers. Officials at both companies noted that the deal aims to help improve and streamline the ability to treat patients.This move is part of a growing shift for health insurers to play a more direct role in actual medical services. Many health insurers now want to be able to provide their own patient care as often as possible. The deal will hopefully cut costs and improve care, given the proximity and number of care centers—especially for people with non-life threatening, chronic conditions.The move comes after CVS announced its acquisition of healthcare benefits giant Aetna on Sunday. The $69 billion deal will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.UnitedHealth's latest deal is its second acquisition in 2017 aimed at bolstering its offerings beyond insurance. In March, UnitedHealth purchased Surgical Care Affiliates for $2.3 billion.Shares of DaVita soared 12% premarket on the back of the announcement. Since then, the stock has cooled a bit and now hovers up around 10% at $67.20 per share, which is still $3 below its 52-week high.UnitedHealth saw its stock price dip in early morning trading, but shares have since gained around 0.80%. CVS stock dipped slightly on Wednesday following the UnitedHealth and DaVita deal.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

946,AET,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) has created quite a buzz in the entire healthcare space. Most economists consider this coming together of two stalwarts — consolidation of CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) business with Aetna’s large and unshakable insurance base — as a new dimension added to healthcare landscape. However, critics are of the view that the gains from this combined entity will be short-lived for the healthcare society at large to benefit from.Vision in Favor of the DealPeople supporting this proposed integration between CVS Health and Aetna opine that this merger has fair chances to pass the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition deal proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists lapping up the deal are looking much forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put the brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article).Blankenhorn in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVC-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout comment that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the United States’ third-largest insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS drugstores to get their prescriptions filled through CVS’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries in queue, finally resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the longer term, patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will in fact diminish competition in the sector leading to inflating prices.To know more in detail, please read: CVS Health's Aetna Buyout to Change Healthcare LandscapeShare Price ComparisonShares of CVS Health have outperformed the broader industry over the past three months.

948,AET,"The healthcare industry is headed for a shakeup after CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) officially announced its purchase of healthcare benefits giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) on Monday.CVS acquired the health insurer in a cash and stock deal worth roughly $69 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at $77 billion. The merger will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.“This combination brings together the expertise of two great companies to remake the consumer health care experience,” CVS CEO Larry J. Merlo said in a statement.“We look forward to working with the talented people at Aetna to position the combined company as America's front door to quality health care, integrating more closely the work of doctors, pharmacists, other health care professionals and health benefits companies to create a platform that is easier to use and less expensive for consumers.”CVS hopes the Aetna buyout will give the drug store giant the ability to become even more of a one-stop-shop. This mega-merger could also help to slowly reshape some of the U.S. healthcare industry. However, shares of both CVS and Aetna dipped on Monday following the announcement.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three healthcare industry stocks that might prove enticing to investors as the industry continues to shift.1.       Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report)Shares of this HMO provider, which serves the under-insured and uninsured with health plans through Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs, have skyrocketed 78.91% this year. At the moment, Centene is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an “A” for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system.For the current year, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Centene’s revenues are projected to climb nearly 18% to $47.84 billion. Centene’s earnings are expected to surge 12.42%. And within the last 60 days, Centene has received 11 positive full-year earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades.Centene also sports a 0.37 price to sales ratio, which marks a discount compared to the “Medical – HMO’s” industry’s average. On top of that, the healthcare power is currently trading at 20.30x earnings, helping further demonstrate Centene’s solid value.2.       Triple-S Management Corporation (GTS  -  Free Report)This San Juan, Puerto Rico-based independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock that rocks an overall “A” VGM grade. Before Monday’s 1% climb, which helped Triple-S’ stock price hit a new 52-week high, shares of the healthcare company had gained 38% this year—more than double the S&P 500’s pace.Triple-S’ 0.23 P/S ratio, which marks a nearly 60% discount compared to the “Medical – HMO’s” industry’s average, helped the company score an “A” for Value in our Style Scores system. What’s more, the company’s current quarter EPS are expected to surge 92.86%, according to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, Triple-S’ full-year earnings are projected to jump from $0.13 per share a year ago to $1.23 per share—or 846%.3.       athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report)Athenahealth is a top provider of internet-based healthcare IT services. This company specializes in online and web services—from record keeping software to back-office operations—for an array of healthcare providers. Athenahealth is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and earned a “B” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Within the last 60 days, the company received seven positive earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and full-year, paired with no downgrades. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Athenahealth’s full-year earnings to gain 6.44%.On top of that, Athenahealth full-year revenues are expected surge 12.46% and hit $1.22 billion. What’s more, shares of Athenahealth have already climbed 26.14% this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

949,AET,"The healthcare space is consolidating with the latest development being the potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report). A drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS has agreed to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna for $207 per share or $69 billion.This would be the biggest deal of the year and the first tie-up of a retailer, an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager in history. As such, the proposed deal would change the landscape of healthcare business as well as streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain (read: Top-Ranked ETFs in Focus on Rumored CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. Upon closure, Aetna shareholders will own approximately 22% of the combined company and CVS Health shareholders will own approximately 78%.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. By owning Aetna, CVS will become the first triple healthcare player: a drugstore, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer. It would be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. This is because CVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management business in the United States and often negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans and employers (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Additionally, the combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmaceutical drugs and has already received pharmacy-wholesaler licenses in a dozen states.The transaction would result in cost synergies of $750 million and low-to-mid single-digit accretion to earnings in the second full year after the transaction closes. It is expected to close in the second half of 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, the total value of the transaction is $77 billion.However, the transaction is expected to attract high antitrust scrutiny because of its sheer size and overlaps in Medicare Part D — a government program to subsidize prescription drug costs. Notably, CVS has a market capitalization of $76.1 billion while AET has a market cap of $59.1 billion. As such, the approval of the transaction might call for certain divestitures of Medicare prescription drug contracts.ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare and consumer ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CVS-AET deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with Aetna occupying the third position, accounting for 7.4% share. The fund has amassed $486.3 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 26,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report)The fund targets companies that have the potential to outperform the broad U.S. consumer staples sector and tracks the MSCI USA Consumer Staples Diversified Multiple-Factor Capped Index. Holding 28 stocks in its basket, CVS Health takes the sixth spot, accounting for 6.1% of the portfolio. In terms of industrial exposure, more than half of the portfolio is dominated by food beverage tobacco while household and personal product and food & staples retailing take the remainder with a double-digit exposure each. This ETF has attracted $2.6 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of about 500 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year and currently has a Zacks ETF Rank of 5 (Strong Sell).PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio (PMR  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the general merchandise stores by tracking the Dynamic Retail Intellidex Index. In total, the product holds 30 securities with CVS taking the fourth spot at 5% of assets. In terms of industrial exposure, specialty retail takes the top spot at 35%, while drug stores (13%), hypermarkets (13%) and food retail (11%) round off the top three positions. The fund has accumulated just $14.5 million in its asset base and charges 63 bps in fees per year. Average daily volume is paltry at 2,000 shares. The ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), with a Medium risk outlook (read: Best ETFs & Stocks From November's Top Sector).VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. Of these, CVS takes the ninth position with 4.2% share. The ETF has a certain tilt toward specialty retail, which accounts for 32% of the portfolio, while Internet direct marketing (22%), hypermarkets (12%), departmental stores (10%), and healthcare services (8%) round off the next four spots. The product has amassed $60 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in annual fees. Volume is light as it exchanges around 13,000 shares per day. RTH has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Should You Buy Retail ETFs Now?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

950,AET,"Dow futures have rocketed up more than 200 points in this morning’s pre-market on news that the Senate has passed its version of a tax reform bill in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The corporate tax rate shedding 15 percentage points — 35% to 20% — is one of the main items the Senate version shares with the House bill, which now faces reconciliation to make its way to President Trump’s desk, which he would surely sign.Same with the pass-through rate and the elimination of the estate tax. In fact, many of the main tenets of each bill fit together, which should help reconciliation (made necessary because the tax cuts were decided on purely party grounds: no Democrats voted for either bill, with only a few defectors from the GOP voting against). There are still some wrinkles that both sides will need to iron out, but because this is far from a bipartisan effort, common ground should be fairly easy to reach.More difficult will be those who were against the tax bills before they even saw the contents of them. Now that we can all see what’s inside, be prepared to see economists, former Treasury Secretaries, etc. to voice their opposition. Republican representatives of “blue” states — those which tend to follow Democratic policies which generally include higher taxes at state and local levels — should be preparing themselves to hear from their voting constituencies, once these citizens recognize that their taxes are likely to go up, not down.In order to help pay for the big tax cuts, elimination of tax write-offs such as state and local, medical costs and waived college tuition look to add tax burdens on millions of households. At the same time, wiping out the estate tax (dubbed the “death tax” by supporters of the current bills) and the Alternative Minimum Tax appear to be clear handouts to singularly high-wealth individuals. And the drastic corporate tax rate cut will already be a boon to shareholders of publicly traded corporations, another main piece of evidence that these tax reform packages are not aimed at working- and middle-class families, as regularly claimed by supporters, but those much farther up the economic food chain.All this is to say that the hard work may be yet to come. House Representatives and some Senators also face re-election in the coming year; if their voting constituencies see the current tax proposals as being sell-outs to the Wall Street upper class — which Candidate Trump explicitly campaigned against, it is worth noting — they may feel the expressed need to make their displeasure known.Return of the Vertical MergerPharmacy retailer CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) has come to terms to buy managed health care giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for a cool $69 billion. This move looks to transform the way health care is managed, with agents of the deal calling the timing “perfect.” The idea is that costs for employer-supported healthcare will be more effectively managed by joining the retailer with the coverage. Recall a year ago, when a similarly sized merger between Aetna and competitor Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) — a horizontal merger, not a vertical one — did not pass antitrust regulation. This morning’s vertical arrangement may be seen more palatable by these same regulators.That’s not to say all vertical merger agreements get a free pass: AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) proposal to buy Time Warner  faces litigation from none other that the U.S. Department of Justice. Government antitrust regulators for this $85+ billion deal claim the merger woulds harm competition and raise consumer prices. Yet thus far, we do not hear similar rhetoric from the Justice Department on the CVS-Aetna merger. We will keep our ears and eyes open, going forward.

952,AET,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) will soon be acquired by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), per a definitive merger agreement.This mega-merger between a pharmacy health care provider, CVS and an insurance company, Aetna, is expected to close in the second half of 2018. Valued at nearly $69 billion, the deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both the companies, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.Notably, the merger-agreement has a greater probability of getting an approval from the regulators since it will be a vertical integration as compared to the horizontal combination (which was feared to create a monopoly in the market and stifle healthy competition among rivals, if passed) of Aetna-Humana Inc. (HUM) deal, which was inked earlier this year.Additionally, the deal seems to be encouraging as it would result in a deadly combination of Aetna’s strong position and its expertise in the health benefits space coupled with CVS’ deep knowledge of the consumers and its leading position in the pharmacy benefits market.This combined entity is anticipated to create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drug to insurance cover.What’s in Store for Aetna?The deal will add to Aetna’s scale and size, and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies in a better way. Consequently, this would lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, thereby enabling the company to share the savings with its consumers through more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium. This, in turn, might ultimately lead to market-share gain.So far this year, the stock has surged 45%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 42%.Gain for ShareholdersAetna shareholders will receive attractive value from the transaction, including $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 shares of CVS Health common stock. Also, approximately 22% of the combined company will be owned by them. Consequently, these shareholders will be able to be a part of the success and high growth potential of the combined company in the near term.Shareholders will benefit from deal which should result in enhanced competitive positioning, low- to mid-single digit accretion in 2019 including the ability to deliver $750 million in near-term synergies.Consolidation in the Health Care SpaceMergers and acquisition (both horizontal and vertical) in the space is rife, given the necessity of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry.  Such deals (pharmacy benefit managers with insurance companies) are the need of the hour at the backdrop of a changing industry, which is rapidly seeing a rise in consumerism.Also, the increased incidence of specialty drugs that are paid through medical and not pharmacy benefit organizations, necessitates the coming together of medical and pharmacy benefit companies.The takeover of Catamaran by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) back in 2015 was in line with this trend.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

953,AET,"After weeks of speculation, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced its decision to acquire Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies. The cash and stock deal will see Aetna shareholders receive $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share with Aetna being valued at approximately $207 per share or about $69 billion ($77 billion including the assumption of Aetna's debt).News about a possible merger between the pharmacy giant and the health insurer had surfaced in late October when the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks with CVS proposing to pay more than $200 per share for the acquisition.With this deal, slated to go through in the second half of 2018, the companies are looking to change the healthcare landscape. The announcement comes at a time when insurers are under pressure to cut medical costs while companies like CVS are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given the rumors about tech giant, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), planning an entry in this space. While there’s low visibility on how Amazon expects to enter this market, its potential entry poses a major threat for retail pharmacy chains like CVS. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to strengthen its position in the pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") business with a wider coverage.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management.A key responsibility is the negotiation of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Formulary coverage and exclusion lists are issued by PBMs to keep consumers aware of drugs that are covered without extra out-of-pocket costs being incurred.  Clients include insurance companies with the focus being on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. By merging with Aetna, CVS will be able to expand coverage to the full ambit of healthcare including the medical benefits space. The combined company is also expected to be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. Moreover, Aetna’s insurance plans could help boost coverage and diversify CVS’s business.The combined company should be well-positioned to meet the health needs of many more people, especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Moreover, CVS Pharmacy locations will add additional products and services including space for wellness, clinical and pharmacy services, vision, hearing, nutrition, beauty, and medical equipment. Post-merger, CVS will find itself in the positon of an integrated retailer, pharmacy benefits manager and health plan provider.What Next?Of late, insurers and PBMs have been coming together especially if one keeps in mind the UnitedHealth-OptumRx combination. Given the changing healthcare scenario and the demand for more transparency where drug pricing is concerned, there could be more such mergers round the corner.Meanwhile, all eyes are focused on Amazon and its plans to enter the healthcare sector. Just last week, a CNBC report said that Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. There has also been news about Amazon having obtained wholesale distribution licenses from the pharmaceutical boards of certain states. With not much information being available, there is a lot of speculation and discussion among industry watchers about the way the tech giant is planning to enter the market – as a drug wholesaler or a retailer.CVS and Aetna are both Zacks Rank#3 (Hold) stocks.

954,AET,"Rumors are rife that CVS Health Corp. CVS is in advanced stages to acquire the health insurer Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for $66 billion.Pharmacy benefit managers work primarily for insurers and employers and seek to negotiate the drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and drugstores to reduce the pocket-pinch for consumers. This in turn lowers the medical cost for insurers.This news drove the shares of Aetna to a new 52-week high of $192.37. The stock has surged 45% year to date, in line with the industry's growth. We believe, this deal has a greater probability of getting a nod from the regulators since it will be a vertical integration as compared to the horizontal combination (which was feared to create a monopoly in the market and stifle healthy competition among rivals, if passed through) of Aetna-Humana deal, which was blocked earlier in the year.The deal seems a good complement, given that it would lead to a deadly combination of Aetna’s strong position and its expertise in the health benefits space with CVS’ deep knowledge of the consumers and its leading position in the pharmacy benefits market.This combined entity would create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drug to insurance cover.What’s in the Offing for Aetna?The deal will add to Aetna’s scale and size and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies better. This would as a result lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, enabling the company to share the savings in with its consumers by way of more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium, thus ultimately leading to market-share gain.Consolidation in the Health Care SpaceMergers and acquisition (both horizontal and vertical) in the space is rife, given the necessity of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry. Such deals (pharmacy benefit managers with insurance companies) are the need of the hour at the backdrop of a changing industry, which is rapidly seeing a rise in consumerism.Also, the increased incidence of specialty drugs that are paid through medical and not pharmacy benefit organizations, necessitates the coming together of medical and pharmacy benefit companies.The takeover of Catamaran by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) also falls under this category.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stocks in the same space is Triple-S Management Corp. (GTS  -  Free Report)  carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

956,AET,"President Donald Trump’s plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare have created quite an uproar among health insurers.

Their strong capital position also reflects profitable operations.Business diversifying strategies with primary focus on ancillary services and products have also boosted the revenue base.Q4 TrendsContinuously rising demand for government plans, especially Medicare and Medicaid, continues to favor health insurers. Hence, revenues of the companies offering these plans are likely to witness a consistent improvement in their government businesses.Moreover, an aging U.S. population that has boosted the overall demand for medical coverage is likely to prove favorable.ObamaCare has significantly benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, boosting medical enrollment and aiding bad debt management. This trend is likely to drive the fourth-quarter results as well.A diversified product portfolio along with proposed mergers and consolidations are also likely to accelerate growth for health insurers in terms of global expansion as well as strengthening of foothold in existing markets.However, the companies have been facing higher losses on public exchanges that have compelled them to scale back operations or plan an exit from the business.Moreover, health insurers have been seeing escalating operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology along with fees and taxes that continue to hurt profits. The companies, however, are trying to tackle the rise in costs with the help of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).Stocks to ConsiderDespite the challenges, the health insurance ndustry has gained nearly 8% quarter to date, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 3.5%.

958,AET,"Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted net loss from continuing operations attributable to its shareholders of 17 cents per share that was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents. However, the figure compares unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.This underperformance primarily stemmed from $55 million decline in California Provider Fee revenues, an estimated $30 million of lower revenues and higher expenses associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Expenses of approximately $20 million related to the sale of the company’s hospitals and related assets in Houston, effective Aug 1, 2017, also contributed to the downside.Operational UpdateThird-quarter net operating revenues came in at $4.6 billion, down 5.4% from the prior-year quarter.

959,AET,"Humana Inc.(HUM  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.The company has a decent surprise history. It pulled off positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.2%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.84% on the back of strong performance by its Retail segment. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s retail segment has been performing well over past many quarters driven by its Medicare and Medicaid expansion initiatives. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $11.2 billion that reflects a slight decrease of 1% year over year.The company’s consistent growth in premium revenues has been largely driven by Medical membership growth. Humana has seen solid medical membership increase in its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage businesses. For the quarter, Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 14 million, up 48% year over year.Other FactorsThe standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership is likely to have grown, adding significantly to the Medicare business.Nevertheless, Humana is expected to suffer from rising benefit expenses that keep putting pressure on margins.Individual commercial membership is expected to remain a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016. Along with other companies like Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana has also started scaling down this business and plans to exit it in 2018. This segment is expected to affect the company’s results in the third quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Humana is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Humana has an Earnings ESP of -1.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.32 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.27.

966,AET,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.45 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 by 19% and also grew 18% year over year. The upside reflects continued strong performance in the company’s Health Care segment as well as lower transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 compared to 2016.Operational UpdateHowever, operating revenues of $14.9 billion not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.1 billion by approximately 1% but also declined 5% year over year. The downside stemmed from lower premiums in Health Care segment that includes lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products and the temporary suspension of the health insurer fee (HIF) in 2017.Adjusted expense ratioimproved 10 basis points (bps) to 17.5% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the temporary suspension of the HIF and Aetna's expense management initiatives. This was largely offset by targeted investment spending on the company’s growth initiatives.Total company expense ratioimproved 50 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17.4%, primarily due to lower transaction and integration-related costs.Third-quarter after-tax net income margin was 5.6 %, up 180 bps year over year.  The adjusted pre-tax marginwas 9.2%, up 70 bps from the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by strong performance in the Health Care segment. This was, however, partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF.Medical membership totaled 22.2 million on Sep 30, 2017, down 4.1% year over year.Segmental Performance UpdateHealth Care segmentTotal revenues were $14.3 billion, down 5.3% year over year. Adjusted revenues came at $14.2 billion, down 6% from the prior-year quarter. The downside was due to lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, lower membership in Medicaid products and the temporary suspension of the HIF. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, flat year over year. This consistent performance reflects strong performance across Aetna's core Health Care businesses and reduced losses in its individual Commercial products. This was, however, partially offset the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) rose 10 bps to 81.9% on the back of improvement in Commercial benefit ratio owing to reduced losses in Aetna's individual Commercial products and improved performance across its core Commercial business. This was, however, partially offset by a deterioration in the Government MBR.Group InsuranceTotal revenues of $650 million increased 4.7% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted revenuesof $631 million grew 2.4% year over year driven by higher premiums in Aetna's life and disability products.Pre-tax adjusted earningswere $34 million, up 54% from the third-quarter 2016 due to higher underwriting margins in disability products, partially offset by lower underwriting margins in life products.Large Case PensionsTotal revenues came at $80 million, up 14% over the third quarter of 2016.

968,AET,"Teldoc Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Nov 1, are expected to witness an increase in patient visits, one of the major driver of the company’s revenues.Telehealth services provided by the company are fast gaining acceptance due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness and superior quality, which are driving demand. This must have consequently propelled patient visits in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the acquisition of HealthiestYou closed in 2016 is expected to result in higher visits and call volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is set at 293,721, up 45% year over year. The company’s guidance for the same is between 275,000 and 300,000.  A major component of the company’s revenues, subscription access fees which account for 80% to 85% of the company’s revenues, is driven primarily by the number of clients, the number of members in a client’s population, the number oof services contracted for by a client and the contractually negotiated prices of the company’s service.Since the company has been continuously adding a number of clients by virtue of its superior service, a wide network of doctors and round-the-clock medical assistance, this revenue component is expected to see a surge in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $51 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 83%.The company is in its growth phase and incurring heavy expenditure in the form of substantial investments made to acquire new clients, build its proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop its technology platform.Thus, the bottom line will see a drain from huge expenses on higher advertising, sales, technology and development, general and administrative functions, and depreciation and amortization. We, however, expect expenditures to decline as the company has started to realize leverage from the scale of its operations.Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Teladoc, Inc.

QuoteGuidance for Q3The company expects net loss per share, based on 56.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, between a loss of 56 cents and 58 cents.Revenues are expected in the range of $67-$68 million.  Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of a loss of $2-$3 million.  Membership is expected between 22.0 million and 22.5 million.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Teladoc has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +15.65%.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

969,AET,"The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close.Last quarter, Allstate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 53.3% and grew 122.6% year over year on higher revenues. The upside was driven by premium growth as well as an increase in net investment income. The customer base rose to 75 million policies in force.The company has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 36.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackAllstate’s earnings have been exposed to catastrophe losses. The first half of 2017 bore the brunt of cat losses and the same is expected in the third quarter, which was shaken by massive catastrophes – Harvey, Irma, Maria.The company has provided preliminary estimates of cat loss of $774 million on a pre-tax basis, owing to weather-related destruction in July and August.In the first quarter, the company closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, a protection plan provider for consumer electronics and connected devices. Allstate previously said that the deal would dilute earnings for three years.Therefore, the effect of the same will be felt in third-quarter results. During the second quarter, Allstate Insurance Company executed a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with SquareTrade’s largest third-party insurer, which should result in higher underwriting and investment income.The company’s customer-focused strategy and a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network will likely result in higher policies issued, thus driving top-line growth.We also expect to see improved auto insurance margins, reflecting broad-based profit improvement plans initiated by the company over two years ago.A large component of the company’s operating income results from investment income so despite the continuation of historically low interest rates, the company has managed well on this front. The portfolio is proactively managed and is primarily a high-quality fixed income portfolio, which generates predictable earnings with modest growth.In the second quarter, the company reported an increase in net investment income and we expect superior performance in the third quarter.Allstate’s capital strength and financial flexibility enables it to manage shareholder capital. The company returned $903 million to its shareholders in the first six months of 2017, which reduced outstanding debt at the beginning of the year by 2.1%. Continuing this trend, shares bought back during the third quarter will push up the company’s bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Allstate has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Lincoln National Corp.

970,AET,"After a deluge of strong earnings reports from tech titans, the biggest story on Wall Street is the potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report). This is especially true, as a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS has proposed to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or around $66 billion according to various sources.This would represent the biggest deal of the year and the first tie-up of a retailer, an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager in history. As such, the proposed deal would change the landscape of healthcare business as well as streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' health care needs, ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. By owning Aetna, CVS will become the first triple healthcare player: a drugstore, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer. It would be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. This is because CVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management business in the United States and often negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans and employers.Additionally, the combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit (read: Ride On UnitedHealth Q3 Strength with These ETFs).The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion into the world of pharmaceutical drugs and has already received pharmacy-wholesaler licenses in a dozen states.However, the transaction is expected to attract high antitrust scrutiny because of its sheer size and overlaps in Medicare Part D, a government program to subsidize prescription drug costs. Notably, CVS has a market capitalization of $77.76 billion while AET has a market cap of $53.35 billion. As such, the approval of the transaction might call for certain divestitures of Medicare prescription drug contracts.ETF ImpactThe proposed merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare and consumer ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CVS-AET deal. These funds have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting their outperformance in the coming months.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with Aetna occupying the second position, accounting for 7.3% share. The fund has amassed $482.5 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 26,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report)The fund targets companies that have the potential to outperform the broad U.S. consumer staples sector and tracks the MSCI USA Consumer Staples Diversified Multiple-Factor Capped Index. Holding 28 stocks in its basket, CVS Health takes the fifth spot, accounting for 5.8% of the portfolio. In terms of industrial exposure, more than half of the portfolio is dominated by food beverage tobacco while food & staples retailing, and household and personal product take the remainder with a double-digit exposure each. This ETF has attracted $2.5 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of about 200 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year.VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. Of these, CVS takes the sixth position with 5.04% share.

971,AET,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 26, 229 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of the 229 S&P 500 members account for 48.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.7% year over year on 5% rise in revenues, with 75.5% beating earnings per share estimates and 65.1% topping revenue estimates.Healthcare Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the spotlight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.Players in the healthcare industry have largely benefitted from a surge in membership fuelled by the Healthcare Reform. Third quarter is expected to witness an increase in enrollment across Government programs particularly Medicaid and Medicare. While Medicaid sales is driven by Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, Medicare  is in huge demand from the growing population of baby boomers.Earnings for players in the hospital industry are likely to reflect the softness in volumes persisting throughout the industry. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the quarter.Nevertheless, aggressive inorganic strategies helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.Moreover, the companies face headwinds  like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions that are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of three medical stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Oct 31.Aetna Inc.’s( (AET  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to witness a decline in Health Care segment revenues due to lower contribution from Commercial health insurance partly offset by premium increase in Government business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $14.4 billion, down 4% year over year.Medical Benefit Ratio is expected to increase in the quarter, owing to an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products and suspension of the health insurer fee. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 84%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.14 million, down 4.2% year over year. The decline is likely to be due to lower membership in the company’s public exchange compliant Individual and Small Group products.However, the company’s continuous focus on managing costs is likely to reduce its operating expenses.Our proven model shows that Aetna has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that significantly increases the chances an earnings beat.

The same is expected to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.The quarter is also likely to see increased interest expenses as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term-loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions. This, in turn, will dent its operating marginsHowever, we expect to see an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment, driven by synergy from recent acquisitions and organic growth.

972,AET,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after market close.Last quarter, this health services company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%. However, earnings declined year over year due to an increase in expense, which outdid revenue growth.The company does not have an impressive surprise history. Though it missed estimates in only one the last four quarters, the average is a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:Q3 FlashbackThe company is likely to see lower revenues from its Ambulatory Services segment, which experienced soft business volumes in the past few quarters.Moreover, the company is reeling under escalating operating expenses for several quarters, due to higher salaries and benefits expenses. Most alarming is the rate of increase in operating expense, which has overshadowed the revenue growth rate, thereby thwarting bottom-line growth. The same is expected to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.A huge debt load is also niggling Envision Healthcare. Its total debt has been swelling since 2013, leading to a spike in interest expense. This, in turn, will dent its operating margins.The quarter is likely to see increased interest expense as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term-loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions.We, nevertheless, expect to see an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment (which contributes nearly 84% of the company’s revenues), driven by synergy from recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. Revenue growth is expected to come from higher patient volumes as well as improved pricing. We also expect to see improved EBIDTA which must have benefited from merger-related synergies.The company’s Ambulatory service segment will likely report a decline in revenues due to disposal of centers.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Envision Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

973,AET,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 31, is expected to witness a decline in revenues in its Health Care segment due to lower contribution from Commercial health insurance partly offset by premium increase in Government business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $14.4 billion, down 4% year over year.Medical Benefit Ratio, a metric used to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, is expected to increase in the third quarter, led by an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products.The company projects an increase in the ratio driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee and experience rating pressure in the company’s Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in its Individual Commercial Insured products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 84%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.14 million, down 4.2% year over year. The decline is likely to be driven by lower membership in the company’s public exchange compliant Individual and Small Group products.The company’s focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses.In the first quarter, Aetna resumed its share buyback which was terminated due to its planned merger with Humana. Share repurchases made by the company in the third quarter will help to lift its earnings.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Aetna has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.68%.

974,AET,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.6%.Q3 ExpectationsWe expect earnings to reflect the prevailing industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes. The same is likely to be seen in the quarter.Patient admissions will, however, be sustained on the back of organic and inorganic growth measures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (represents the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 483,000, which reflects year-over-year growth of 2.8%.Shares bought back by the company in the third quarter will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain this policy.Preliminary ResultsRecently, the company announced preliminary financial and operating results for the to-be-reported quarter. It reported revenues of approximately $10.7 billion, up 4.1% year over year and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, down 9.2% year over year. Earnings per share of $1.21 per share reflected a decline 25% year over year.  The results bore the impact of recent hurricanes, which caused loss of $140 million in some of the company’s major markets.Same facility admissions in the third quarter increased 0.6%, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.3% year over year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 0.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same facility equivalent admissions points to an increase of 0.5%.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

975,AET,"Pharmacy giant, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), has reportedly made an offer to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for more than $66 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal, the companies are in talks and CVS has proposed to pay more than $200 per share for the acquisition.Why Aetna – the Rationale behind the DealCVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") business in the United States. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) provide formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management.They negotiate prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Formulary coverage and exclusion lists are issued by PBMs to keep consumers aware of drugs that are covered without extra out-of-pocket costs being incurred.  Clients include insurance companies with the focus being on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to expand coverage to the full ambit of healthcare including the medical benefits space. The merged company would also be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. Moreover, Aetna’s insurance plans could help boost coverage and diversify CVS’s business.The potential Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) threat could be another reason for CVS’s interest in acquiring Aetna. Amazon, which is rumored to be preparing to enter the pharmacy supply channel, would be a formidable competitor for PBMs. While there is not much visibility on how Amazon plans to enter the prescription drugs business, its potential entry poses a major threat for retail pharmacy chains like CVS. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to strengthen its position in the PBM business with a wider coverage.Changing the Healthcare IndustryThe merger, if it goes through, would change the healthcare industry the way we know it today. Of late, insurers and PBMs have been coming together especially if one keeps in mind the UnitedHealth-OptumRx combination. Given the changing healthcare scenario, the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the uncertainty faced by insurers as the “repeal and replace Obamacare” scenario plays out and the demand for more transparency where drug pricing is concerned, there could be more such mergers round the corner.Of course, it eventually remains to be seen whether the deal actually goes through. The insurance industry has seen quite a few failed deals recently including Aetna’s attempts to acquire Humana and Anthem’s plans to acquire Cigna with both deals running into regulatory roadblocks.  While CVS is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Aetna is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

976,AET,"Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 31.Last quarter, the company reported a positive surprise of 16.7%. Sony scored three colossal earnings beats over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 69.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSony’s fiscal second-quarter results will likely benefit from the booming Digital Entertainment Hub products, which have been driving strong profitability for the company in recent quarters.The PlayStation4 console, which is arguably Sony’s biggest growth driver, is going strong even after three years of release, as evidenced by the company’s latest released numbers. The consumer electronics giant had announced a few months back that it has sold over 60.4 million units of the console to date. PS4 Pro, the upgraded version of PS4 gaming console, and virtual reality (VR) system are likely to act as major profit churners for the gaming business this quarter.Also, the array of gaming applications for mobile products launched over the past two quarters is likely to bolster the gaming division revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Per latest figures from the Entertainment Software Association, the gaming market in 2017 will be worth $108 billion, and Sony’s results are anticipated to benefit from such buoyant industry trends.Sony has also been experiencing strong growth in its Music segment, driven by higher visual media and platform sales, and this will likely reflect in the upcoming quarter as well. Increase in media networks and television productions sales, as well as insurance premium revenues are expected to stoke growth of the Pictures and Financial Services segment respectively.Other positive industry trends that will likely boost Sony’s numbers include an uptick in smartphone and image sensor sales for mobile products, which will drive its Semiconductors segment sales.In addition to this, Sony’s focus on cost-saving initiatives, lower exposure in low-profit geographic regions and reduction in advertising & promotion expenses are expected to boost fiscal first-quarter results. Over the past few quarters, major restructuring efforts and internal shuffles have helped Sony optimize its business structure. This is estimated to prove conducive to operating profit growth in the upcoming quarters.Despite these positives, lingering effect of the Kumamoto earthquakes, one of Japan’s most formidable natural disasters in recent times, may prove to be an overhang for Sony’s results. Moreover, costs associated with the ongoing restructuring efforts are likely to escalate operating expenses, thus restricting earnings and margin expansion in the quarter under review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sony will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 54 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sony has a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1.

980,AET,"It’s been a relatively good year for pharmaceutical stocks, given that they have caught the eye of investors for the greater part of 2017. Despite occasional comments on drug pricing, this time around from President Trump, pharma companies have been largely spared close scrutiny on this front. Such a scheme of things is a far cry from Hillary Clinton’s comments on this issue in the run up to the last Presidential elections.Additionally, Trump’s commitment toward deregulation has gladdened sector leaders. Meanwhile, there are some other factors that should continue to have a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks. These are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products. (Read: 5 Pharma & Biotech Stocks That Could Be Big Winners in Q3 Earnings)Signs of the sector’s success are more than evident. The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index have gained 13.7% and 21.1%, respectively, year to date.With Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled during this period include Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceThe pharma sector’s recovery in fortunes is more than evident from the price performance of the broader industry, which is up 18.7% year to date. Both Pfizer and Merck are underperformers with respect to their broader industry. However, Pfizer is the better performer on this count, since it has gained 11.3% year to date versus Merck’s 6.1% gain.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, both Merck and Pfizer are undervalued relative to their broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.31. However, Pfizer holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 9.6, compared to Merck’s value of 10.4.Dividend YieldBoth Pfizer and Merck have offered a superior dividend yield over the last one year period compared to the broader industry, which has returned 2.9% over this period. However, with a dividend yield of 3.5%, Pfizer is ahead of Merck on this count, but only because Merck has offered a dividend yield of 3% over the same period.Gross MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which likely helps the sector maintain its stiff margins.With a gross margin TTM value of 67.9%, Merck underperforms rival Pfizer on this count. On the other hand, Pfizer sports a gross margin TTM value of 78.2%, which outperforms Merck as well as the broader industry, which has a gross margin TTM value of 72.5%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Merck has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.1%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of -0.4%.When considering Earnings ESP, Merck is once again the clear winner. With an ESP of -0.11%, Pfizer is at a disadvantage, since Merck holds a value of +0.12%. Additionally, Merck’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased by 0.2% over the last 30 days, while Pfizer’s has remained unchanged.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Pfizer holds an edge over Merck when considering price performance, EV/EBITDA ratios and gross margins. It also sports a marginally superior dividend yield. However, when considering estimate revisions and a more comprehensive look at its previous earnings performance, Merck is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Merck at this point in time is that it sports a superior ESP value of +0.12% compared with Pfizer’s dismal reading of -0.11%. This is why it may be better to bet on Merck over Pfizer as they prepare to report earnings over the next few days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

981,AET,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc (HIG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the U.S. group life and disability business of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for a cash consideration of $1.45 billion. The transaction is expected to culminate in November 2017.This buyout aims to expand Hartford Financial’s Group Benefits distribution capabilities and ramp up its technology strategy.Transaction DetailsThe purchase consideration of $1.45 billion comprises a ceding commission which will be paid by Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Company, the primary Group Benefits insurance operating subsidiary of Hartford Financial.The transaction also includes an exclusive, multi-year collaboration deal per which Aetna will be offering Hartford Financial’s group life and disability products through its medical sales team.Aetna’s book of group life and disability insurance, which had premiums of approximately $2 billion in 2016 will be reinsured by Hartford  Financial on an indemnity basis. Post takeover, most of the Aetna Group Insurance employees across the country will be transferred to Hartford Financial.    Financing the TransactionHartford Financial intends to finance the cash consideration by deploying dividends from its insurance affiliates and holding company resources, including $273 million under its 2017 share repurchase plan. The company does not expect any share repurchase authorization in 2018.Hartford Financial does not expect to issue any debt or equity for financing the buyout.Rationale of the TransactionThis transaction will help Hartford Financial to emerge as the second-largest group life and disability insurer. Group life and disability, banking on its stable risk profile, lucrative returns and strong long-term growth prospects, is a significant business for Hartford Financial.Joining forces with Aetna will strengthen Hartford Financial’s foothold as a leader in the large employer market and expand its presence among midsize employer clients. Moreover, Hartford Financial will be able to grab new opportunities to distribute complementary products to a customer base of more than 20 million to be insured by the combined business.This transaction will also be beneficial to both entities’ shareholders and customers, and help them focus in a personalized manner to improve member health. The transaction will be accretive to Hartford Financial’s 2018 earnings per share.With this acquisition, the acquirer will be able to leverage the industry-leading digital assets and an integrated absence management platform to improve customer experience.Aetna, on the other hand, intends to utilize the sale proceeds for various purposes, including but not restricted to internal investments, share repurchases and debt repayment. Though the transaction will not affect its 2017 bottom line, it will be slightly dilutive to the 2018 bottom line.Hartford Financial continues to utilize data and advanced analytics across workers’ compensation and disability to drive better results for clients across group life and disability lines. As the nation’s second-largest workers’ compensation insurer and group disability insurer, this buyout improves Hartford Financial’s competitive position in the market and enhances its capabilities for future product offerings in the line of absence management.A.M. Best Jumps Into ActionFollowing the announcement of the acquisition, A.M. Best commented that the credit ratings of Hartford Financial and its affiliates remain unchanged.The rating agency expects the financial leverage and coverage measures at the holding company to remain within levels that support the current ratings. Further, it expects the risk-adjusted capitalization of the entities to remain at adequate levels.Insurers Opting the Inorganic RouteMergers and acquisitions not only add capabilities to a portfolio but also expand geographical footprint of companies, thereby expanding their growth profile. Hence, acquisitions rage the insurance space. Earlier this month, White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (WTM  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a 50% stake in DavidShield to gain a premier spot in the accident and health insurance market. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Reynolds & Rodar Insurance Group, Inc to expand its presence in New Mexico. Zacks Rank & Share Price MovementHartford Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Hartford Financial have outperformed the industry year to date. While Hartford Financial’s shares have returned 13.4%, the industry has gained 9.5%. We expect the company’s diversified product offerings and strategic acquisitions to further drive its shares in the near term.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

982,AET,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 after  market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s two segments, Acute Care and Behavioral Health, have been performing strongly over the past many quarters. The segments have been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds as well as patient days that have significantly resulted in higher revenues.  This yet-to-be-reported quarter is also likely to see the same bullish trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenue is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%.  Our consensus estimates for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments are currently pegged at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 10% and 6.4% respectively, year over year.Since 2012, the average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing and the trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.. Our consensus estimates for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health are pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 3% and 6% year over year, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.1 billion and 120.7 billion respectively, up 5% and 7% year over year, respectively. This in turn is expected to aid the company’s top line in the third quarter significantly.Other FactorsUniversal Health’s efforts to enhance shareholders’ value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count.Nevertheless, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, plus impairments of long-lived assets might have put pressure on margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Universal Healthis likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Universal Health has an Earnings ESP of -1.01%.

983,AET,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Anthem has been witnessing revenue appreciation over the past many quarters, backed by membership growth. Both its fully insured and self-funded memberships have grown consistently. The third quarter is also expected to witness the same uptrend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenue is currently pegged at $22.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 5%. Our consensus estimates for fully insured and self-funded memberships stand at 15.3 million and 25 million, up 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively.Total medical enrollment has also been steadily rising on the back of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical enrollment is pegged at 40.3 million, up 1% year over year. The Government business of Anthem has been a major contributor behind this increase in Medical enrollment. Our consensus estimate for total operating revenue of Government business is $11.8 billion, up 3% year over year.Operating revenues of its Commercial business have also been impressive over the years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total operating revenue from Commercial business is $10.1 billion, up 5% year over year.Other Factors at PlayMedicare Advantage product offerings might have supported Medicare enrollment growth, again boosting the company’s top line.However, Anthem expects to witness higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products as was the case last quarter.In addition, the company is likely to have experienced higher benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business due to higher claims.Administrative costs are likely to have risen during the third quarter continuing the previous trend.The Individual business is also expected to remain a drag in the third quarter.Earnings PredictionsOur proven model shows that Anthem has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP:Anthem has an Earnings ESP of +1.55%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.45 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41. The positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise.

984,AET,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend  to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year over year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base. Medicaid expansion, another provision of Affordable Care Act, has benefitted Centene. This was driven by Centene’s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers are exiting it. The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business. In the third quarter, the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5.8 billion, reflecting a year over year growth of  3.6%.Moreover, Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses. The margin is likely to be aided by lower  expenses in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expenses ratio is currently pegged at 0.09 compared with 9.23 in the second quarter of 2017.Other FactorsApart from the Medicaid expansion, growing Medicare beneficiaries are also likely to drive the top line in the third quarter.The company’s Government-sponsored Health Insurance business is anticipated to perform well, adding to the top line.Centene also expects its exchange business to perform well in 2017 and the to-be-reported quarter is expected to reflect the same trend.The international business is also likely to perform well in the third quarter as well as in 2017.The company’s share repurchase programs intended to enhance shareholders’ value might impact margins positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Increasing costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets might affect earnings.Earnings PredictionsOur proven model shows that Centene has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.45%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.28 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat.

985,AET,"The U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) reported upbeat third-quarter results. It topped our estimates on the bottom line and raised its full-year outlook.Net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and were 22.6% higher year over year. Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.The company posted net revenues of $50.3 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 8.7% year over year. The company reported medical care ratio of 81.4%, up 110 basis points year over year.Buoyed by its strong earnings performance, the company raised its outlook for 2017 earnings. The company now expects 2017 GAAP net earnings to touch $9.45 per share (versus $9.20 to $9.35 per share guided earlier) and adjusted net earnings to near $10.00 per share (versus previous guidance of $9.75-$9.90).Market ImpactThe market has welcomed UNH’s earnings beat and its strong outlook. Shares of UNH jumped as much as 5.5% following its earnings announcement on about 3.28 times elevated volumes. After all, the stock has a VGM (Value, Growth, Momentum) Score of B and its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28%.Since UnitedHealth is the first insurer to report earnings and a bellwether, the result has acted as a cornerstone for the broad health insurance sector with stocks of other players in the space in green at the close on the day. Some of these players include Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) – up 2.9%, Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report) - up 1.9%, Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) – up 1.2% and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) – up 1.4%.Given UnitedHealth’s strength to lift the health insurer corner of the broad health care space and the solid run up in its share price, some ETFs heavily invested in UnitedHealth could be worth watching for investors seeking to ride out the recent surge. Below we highlight a few ETFs.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF has exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with United Health at the top spot that accounts for the largest 14.19% share.

It holds about 30 healthcare and medical stocks for the long term.Tracey has been getting questions from listeners wondering if there is any value in healthcare stocks right now. Are any of them cheap?Biotechs on FireThe biotechs are hot again. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) has soared 47% this year while the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has gained 27%.But can some value still be found in the biotechs? And what about all the other healthcare industries?Zacks’ Medical Sector has over 800 companies, including drug companies, hospitals, managed care insurers, medical device companies, dental companies and others. They’re not all created equal.Tracey and Kevin ran a screen to quickly find basic value stocks within the sector. They looked only in the Medical sector and chose a current year forward P/E less than 20 and a next year forward P/E of under 15.They didn’t screen for Zacks Rank.It returned 61 stocks.Tracey and Kevin discuss about a dozen of them on this week’s podcast including these 5 big names.5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks1.      Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) has been cheap for years. It trades with a forward P/E of just 9.1. But earnings are on the decline. The company made $11.57 last year and expects to just make $8.74 this year. It recently bought KITE but will that be enough to give earnings a boost? Or is it a value trap?2.      Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is another big biotech that is cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.6. Two analysts just raised their price targets to over $400 on the stock. Unlike Gilead, it’s expected to see earnings growth this year and next year.3.      Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) is the cheapest in the group. It trades with a forward P/E of 3.4 but investors have to be concerned about those falling earnings estimates. It made $5.14 in 2016 and is expected to make just $3.82 in 2018. Is it a value trap?4.      AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has the rare combination of an attractive P/E at just 16.4 and rising earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to jump 14% in 2017 and another 19% in 2018. Should ABBV be on your short list?5.      Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) is in the managed care group, which, is one of the most difficult areas to be in right now due to Obamacare uncertainty. But Aetna has been reducing its exposure to the exchanges and it trades with a forward P/E of just 15.9.There are other industries that are also in the cone of uncertainty due to the unknowns surrounding Obamacare, including the hospitals.Tracey and Kevin discuss the hospital group, especially Tenet Healthcare (THC).Additionally, Valeant (VRX) appears to be cheap, but Tracey fears it’s a value trap.And what about medical device companies? They’ve been hot this year but are they just too expensive to make the list?Find out the answer to all of these questions and more on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

987,AET,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and increasing 22.6% year over year.Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.UnitedHealth has a tradition of guiding conservatively and then beating its own estimates to surprise investors. The company surpassed expectations in 25 out of 28 reported quarters and the quarter under review was no exception.The stock gained 0.35% in the pre-market trading session and we expect continued outperformance to drive the stock higher.Behind the HeadlinesUnitedHealth posted net revenues of $50.3 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

This will further disrupt the public exchange markets. But UnitedHealth is better off than others in the industry given its well-diversified business which shields it from strict regulations.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookUnitedHealth with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) has got this reporting cycle off to a flying start. While the other players in the space are lined up to report their financial results, below are three that are poised to beat on earnings as per our model.Anthem Inc.

988,AET,"President Trump has come up with an executive order to dismantle the health care reform act following the failure of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which was a last ditch effort in achieving the objective.What Does the Executive Order Say?One of the most disturbing proposals is putting an end to cost sharing reduction (CSR) payments that help low-income Americans pay for health insurance. Health insurers and hospitals have long pleaded the President to maintain the subsidies so that health insurers can function on the exchanges. Without these subsidies it would be uneconomical for insurers to sell policies on exchanges.Other than CSR, the plan also proposes loosening standards with respect to pre-existing conditions.Insurers UnsureCutting of cost-sharing subsidies that were directly paid to health insurers has prompted players to take another look at their participation on public exchanges. Already a number of players like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) have exited these exchanges after suffering huge losses.Meanwhile, shares of some of the players having substantial presence on public exchanges such as Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) lost 3.3% and Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) was down 3.4% in the trading session following the announcement.Hospitals Too Sick to Suffer More?Trump’s executive order has sent jitters across the hospital sector that has been weighed down by a weak business environment. Players overall are suffering from weak business volumes in the form of low patient admissions and fewer patient visits. Also, an increase in uncompensated care and charity care have eaten into their bottom line.The same is evident from comments by one of the leading industry players, HCA Healthcare Inc. which during second-quarter earnings, said that its uncompensated care including bad debt and charity care are rising faster this year than in the last. It is seeing roughly 4% to 5% growth in uninsured admissions, “which is a little higher than the last half of 2016 and first quarter.”Another large for-profit hospital operator, Tenet Healthcare said uncompensated care costs that dropped from 2015 to 2016 are now on the rise. In its hospitals, volumes have been softer than anticipated and an increase in uninsured revenues has resulted in upward pressure on uncompensated care expense.Players are all the more jittery since axing of cost-sharing reductions would directly lead to a rise in uninsured patients, translating into unpaid hospital bills.Industry’s PerformanceDespite the uncertainty, the industry has performed strongly as evident by a rise of 80.6% in a year’s time compared with a gain of 20.8% for the S&P 500.What Lies NextTurbulences like this have been common in the health care space for the past one year or so from the time efforts are being made to pull back Obamacare.

989,AET,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and its units have recently received Star Ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for its Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans.Per CMS, in 2018, more than 60% of Anthem’s Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in MA plans that have achieved four stars or more, with five stars being the highest limit.The Know-How of Star RatingsStar Ratings are calculated every year on a scale of one to five stars (five being the highest limit), and are subject to change. CMS rates MA and Medicare prescription drug plans (PDP) on the basis of how well they provide medication coverage along with a number of factors like the quality of customer service being provided, count and frequency of member complaints, members’ experience with drug plans and the level of safety associated with the drugs.While assigning the ratings, CMS considers two parameters of the MA and PDPs namely, quality and performance. The MA plans are rated on the basis of their ability to take care of the members’ overall health, help them manage chronic conditions, ensure positive experiences with health plan, attain member satisfaction and offer effective customer service.Rationale Behind the RatingsThese Star Ratings reflect Anthem’s multi-year focus on the improvement of the quality of its Medicare offerings. It further intends to improve the performance of its health plans moving into 2019. Only 22% members were enrolled in four-star or better plans in 2016 Star Ratings.Over the last four years, Anthem remained committed to upgrade the performance and quality of its Medicare platform. It has been diligently engaged in providing the MA members greater access to high-quality health care at an affordable cost. The company looks forward to continuously customize its Medicare Advantage product portfolio with further innovation.Anthem and its affiliated health plans have made significant investments for expanding MA plans product portfolio and services areas. They also worked on local health plan staffing along with strengthening the level of engagement between provider and member.  On the back of these efforts, Anthem expects its Medicare business to grow further in 2018.Share Price PerformanceAnthem’s continues focus on creating customer delight has helped the stock retain shareholders’ confidence.

We expect solid Medicare advantage performance to continue in the third quarter driven by the combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance, and improved service and clinical performance, all leading to record retention rates.The company’s Medicaid business is also performing well with continued growth in membership enrollment. The same is expected in the third quarter through new contract awards from states for Managed Medicaid business, as well as for expanded services for additional segments of the Medicaid eligible population.We expect to see increased enrollment in the third quarter driven by increased membership in Medicare Advantage, Commercial and Medicaid plans.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services’ segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from sub-segments OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.Earnings will, however, be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all individual public exchange markets.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the same space that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

992,AET,"Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report) is one of the largest publicly traded managed care organizations in terms of membership. Strategic acquisitions, national accounts in the commercial segment and the Medicaid expansion in the government segment have significantly boosted the company’s membership base.Anthem’s revenues have also grown on the back of net investment income that started increasing since 2016 on the back of interest rate hikes.The Indianapolis, IN-based company’s capital management, backed by solid cash position, also impresses.  Sufficient generation of cash flows have enabled the company to enhance shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives like share repurchases, dividend payouts etc.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance. In three of the last four quarters, Anthem’s bottom line surpassed expectations with an average beat of 8.6%. Following strong second-quarter 2017 results, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 that further boosts shareholders' confidence in the stock.However, loss incurred from public exchange business continues to hurt the company’s bottom line and top line, as evident from a significant decline in enrollment in this business since 2016. Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable returns from individual market, we remain cautious. Along with other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Anthem is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business for 2018.Moreover, the company’s rising level of debt not only increases financial risks but also raises interest expenses, which weighs on margins.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!    It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

993,AET,"There are many different ways to make money in the stock market. One proven way to earn great returns, which many investors use, is to invest in stocks within the best performing industries.Studies have shown that tapping into an average stock in a strong industry can be a better option than picking an outstanding stock in a relatively poor-performing industry. This is not to say that any stock chosen at random in a great industry will make money, but by picking a strong industry, you certainly improve your odds.This is where choosing a stock with a strong Zacks Rank, which also falls within an industry that sports a top Zacks Industry Rank, can prove successful. Zacks classifies stocks into 265 different industries. The Zacks Industry Rank is calculated by taking the average Zacks Rank for every stock in that industry category every day.Now, let’s look at three great stocks that also fall within highly ranked industries:1.       H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report)H&E rents and sells products for an array of industries, ranging from earthmoving and concrete equipment to cranes and generators. H&E is coming off a solid second quarter that saw its revenues jump by 3.0% to $249.4 million and its net income pop from $7.5 million to $9.9 million.This Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and scored an “A” grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. H&E is part of the “Manufacturing – Construction and Mining” industry, which currently ranks #4 overall out of the 265 industries tracked by Zacks.The company’s P/S ratio of 1 matches the industry average, while its EV/EBITDA of 5.21 outpaces the industry’s 9.99. The stock has gained 16.86% year-to-date, which tops the S&P 500’s 10.18%.According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company’s earnings are expected to pop 21.21% this quarter, and its sales are set to jump 4.91% for the current quarter and 6.04% next quarter. Within the last 60 days, H&E has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current quarter, next quarter, current year, and following year periods.2.       Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report)This healthcare conglomerate serves more than 74 million people, including 40 million within its family-based healthcare plans. Anthem offers a wide range of medical and specialty products and owns Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance.Anthem is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company’s standing in the “Medical – HMO’s” industry places Anthem in the top 4% of industries at #11 overall.Anthem’s shares are currently trading at 15.48x earnings, which represents a discount to the market as a whole—and compared to the industry’s average. The company’s P/B ratio of 1.82 also marks a discount to the industry and some of its biggest competitors, including Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Also, its 45.11% gain over the past year crushes the S&P 500 average and tops the industry’s 32.24% gain.Based on our current consensus estimates, Anthem’s sales are projected to grow 4.74% this quarter and 5.66% for the year. The company’s earnings are projected to gain 7.51% for the year.3.       Amtech Systems, Inc. (ASYS  -  Free Report)Amtech is a supplier of production and automation systems and related supplies for the manufacture of solar cells, semiconductors, and silicon wafers. The company sits within the #3 ranked “Semiconductor – General” industry, which places Amtech in the top 1% of industries tracked by Zacks.Despite resting near its 52-week high, Amtech stock could still have room for continued growth down the line. The Tempe, Arizona-based company’s projected full-year EPS growth of 125% crushes the industry average of 38.69% and blows away semiconductor giant Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) projected 40.13% growth.Based on our current consensus estimates, the company’s sales are projected to climb 9.17% in the current quarter and 29.83% for the year. Amtech’s 170.82% year-to-date price change thoroughly outpaces the industry average of 51.40% and crushes the S&P 500 average of 10.18%, meaning that it has been one of the hottest stocks in this strong industry.Amtech is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Growth and an “A” for Momentum in our Style Scores system.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

994,AET,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ending Aug 31, 2017) results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 19 cents per share, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents.We note that on an average, AngioDynamics has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.74% in the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAngioDynamics enjoys leading market share in several of its operating segments including angiographic products and thrombolytic catheters and products. The market served by the company is in excess of $1 billion and continues to grow.AngioDynamics’ broad array of products like AngioVac, BioFlo and NanoKnife significantly enhances market opportunities. Notably, the peripheral vascular (PV) sales business has also built a strong momentum for the company.For fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents. The company projects fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $352 million to $359 million. Furthermore, free cash flow is expected to be over $35 million. The earnings growth rate is expected to be higher than growth in sales, primarily because of cost curtailment initiatives.However, declining sales in the Oncology, Vascular Access, Non-BioFlo products and NanoKnife businesses may hurt quarterly sales.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AngioDynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AngioDynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 16 cents.Zacks Rank: AngioDynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.78% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

995,AET,"Markets closed slightly higher on Friday after healthcare stocks surged after Senator McCain decided not to support the repealing of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, shares of Apple tumbled after iPhone 8’s release was met with a less than impressive response. This weighed heavily on the Dow, which ended in the red. Further, tensions between North Korea and the United States escalated after Kim Jong-un retaliated against President Trump's comments at the United Nations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,349.59, losing 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,502.22. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,422.69, increasing 0.1%.

This crushed Republicans’ hopes of pushing through the Graham –Cassidy legislation which also implies repeal of the Obamacare plan.Such a statement from McCain sent healthcare stocks higher. The SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF, which was down 0.5% in the afternoon, pared losses to finish just 0.1% lower. Shares of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CIG  -  Free Report) both gained 0.2%. This boosted the overall markets.However, uncertainty about the success of the Graham-Cassidy legislation sent the shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) lower by over 1.6%. This weighed heavily on the Dow.Apple Suffers Worst Weekly Loss in a YearApple (AAPL  -  Free Report) suffered its worst weekly loss in a year’s time after it dipped about 1% after speculations over lack of demand of its recently launched smartphone iPhone 8 weighed on the broader markets. Speculations regarding low demand for iPhone 8 arose after the response to its launch was less than exuberant. The company possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This weighed heavily on the Dow and the blue-chip index shed almost 10 points to end in negative territory. Also adding to woes of the Dow was a decline in the shares of UnitedHealth Group. Meanwhile, Russell 2000 index breached record after it closed at 1,450.78, gaining almost 7 points or 0.5%. This also marked the small-cap index’s first record close since Jul 25.Geopolitical Tensions with North Korea EscalateIn the latest of a series of threats, North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho announced that the country was planning to test a hydrogen bomb in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. This test would mark North Korea’s first outside its borders. Coincidentally, this comes right after North Korea’s Kim Jong-un retaliated against Trump’s comments at the United Nation General Assembly.Earlier, Trump had issued fresh sanctions against North Korea in response to the country’s missile launching spree. He also promised to blacklist individuals and organizations engaging in business with North Korea in an announcement on Thursday. Market watchers chose to ignore such developments as analysts feel that investors have become immune to tensions with North Korea.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and 0.1% respectively. However, the Nasdaq posted a weekly loss of 0.3%. President Donald Trump made his debut speech at the United Nations General Assembly and urged member states to combat ‘rogue’ nations. Meanwhile, Fed announced the much anticipated unwinding of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, deciding to keep the benchmark interest rates unchanged.

997,AET,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Aetna Inc. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Aetna Inc.’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.8) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Aetna Inc. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 16.4, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Aetna Inc. has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, Aetna Inc. is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Aetna Inc. currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AET a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Aetna Inc. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of C. This gives AET a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen eight estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 6.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen about 6.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Aetna Inc. Price and Consensus  Aetna Inc. Price and Consensus | Aetna Inc.

998,AET,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.‘s (UNH  -  Free Report) subsidiary UnitedHealthcare has collaborated with Community Care Physician Network LLC (“CCPN”) for creating a new Advanced Care Medical Home and care management network relationship. With this agreement, North Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries get the right to access CCPN’s 2,200 independent primary care providers in counties across the state under the new managed care system, that will be launched in 2019.Both the involved companies have the plans to work closely for coming up with innovative approaches to enhance patient care as well as reduce health care costs.UnitedHealthcare expects to offer improvised patient experience and health outcomes along with optimum physician satisfaction with this tie-up.Currently, CCPN clinicians cater to 700,000 North Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries, with more than 40% of patients enrolled in Medicaid that is the primary care management program. These practices involve providing critical heath care services in urban and rural counties across the state and care for a significant part of North Carolinians who require unique and complex health care.This new agreement would provide the required industry experience, data and support to CCPN, which would allow it to provide treatments using an innovative value-based model that is focused on keeping people healthy. UnitedHealthcare shares data related to patients’ underlying medical conditions, medical history, missed care opportunities, etc. with CCPN, making it easy for them to understand the patient’s condition and treat accordingly. This not only takes off burden from the patient by making their data readily available to the doctors but reduces the chances of duplicative tests and improves care coordination as well.Recently, the company's Kansas subsidiary was selected by the State of Kansas along with subsidiaries of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) as one of three managed care organizations administering KanCare, the statewide Medicaid program, effective Jan 1, 2019. This shows that the company is focused on its Medicaid Business, which remains attractive and most sough-after because states are increasingly outsourcing the plan to private insurers for its effective cost management.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 36.4% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s growth of 32%.

1000,AET,"Injecting a fresh dose of uncertainty for health insurers, the Trump administration has said that it would halt payments under risk adjustment. This will put the money of many insurers with sicker customers at stake.The risk-adjustment program was formed under Obamacare. It is a mechanism under which insurers with a healthier customer profile received from Obamacare health exchanges compensate those with a sicker patient population.This risk-adjustment arrangement was put in place to make the functioning of the insurance market places smoother and prevent any of the insurance companies from “cherry-picking” customers.On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that it will be compelled to suspend $10.7 billion in risk-adjustment payments which were due for 2017, following a month’s old federal ruling.Effect of SuspensionThe effect of this halt will be varied, with insurers as well as customers facing the consequences. In the short term, however, insurance companies with a healthier patient population will be better off as they would stand to gain on savings on the risk-adjustment payment, which otherwise would have to be made by them to their less-advantageous counterparts. The loser would obviously be the insurer group that was the recipient of funds under the risk-adjustment program.Over the long term, the fear is that the end of the risk-adjustment program will disrupt the health insurance market place. Since those who lose from costly customers and do not get compensation from the risk-adjustment program would raise the premium, making health insurance more expensive. This might eventually lead to an increase in the uninsured rate, which means a lesser number of Americans buying policies and a decline in the top line of players.The risk-adjustment program along with two other programs, namely risk corridors and reinsurance, were put in place to stabilize premiums and lessen the risk of operating in the law’s fledgling individual marketplaces.According to FierceHealthcare, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) paid the maximum in the risk-adjustment program from 2014-2016 of nearly $1 billion. Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Kaiser Permanente and Fidelis Care rounded out the top five payers.The action has caused industry-wide chaos among health insurers and supporters. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Serota said in a statement that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “should take immediate action to reinstate these payment transfers to ensure the market works as intended.”One of the biggest health insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), has already left the insurance marketplace due to losses incurred from it.  Given the uncertainty over risk-adjustment payments, other insurers still present on the exchanges are struggling to price their policies and decide marketplaces on which to offer their plans. If regulatory uncertainty persists, other companies also may call it quits from the marketplace business.  Friction in Sight?This action along with other regulatory moves would make the functioning of the Affordable Care Act all the more difficult. The most pertinent of the recent regulations is  the repeal of the individual mandate provision, which required individuals to carry a health insurance or to pay a fine in case of failure to do so. This regulatory action is believed to give healthy young individuals the choice to remain uninsured. The CBO estimates that this rule will cause premiums to go up by nearly 10%. Other changes such as reducing the advertising budget for Obamacare exchanges and narrowing the open enrollment period work against the ACA.All these factors combined will lead to an increase in the uninsured rate, which has already been showing an uptick. The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund data showed that the uninsured rate rose in the first few months of this year, from 12.7% at the end of 2016 to 15.5% in the first three months of 2018.Health insurers have showed resilience by putting up a superior performance for the past several years since the Affordable Care Act was enacted andwe  believe  that the players will emerge as winners over the long term. Nonetheless, short-term jerks will prevail until the regulatory dust settles.In a year’s time, the industry has grown 30%, which is more than double the gain of 14% clocked by the S&P 500 index and 1.7% by the Medical sector.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1001,AET,"Putting an end to speculations, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has finally stepped into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry. In line with this, the online retail behemoth recently announced a definitive acquisition agreement with PillPack. Although the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, a few market experts estimate the value of the transaction at $1 billion.This news was heavily cheered by investors, sending Amazon’s share price 2.5% higher on the day of the announcement.Does Amazon’s Entry Spell Doom for Pharmacies?Although Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business was well speculated, it still came as a shocker for industry bigwigs. Let’s take a closer look at the reactions of some of the behemoths.Amazon.com, Inc. Price  Amazon.com, Inc. Price | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBeginning with, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), which has been basking in the glory of being added as the youngest member to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, saw a 9.9% decline in stock price on the day of the buyout announcement. The company also saw a rating downgrade by a number of analysts.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stocks of other big retailers like Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) also slipped around 11.1% and 6.1% on the same day.CVS Health Corporation Price  CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer reports, three of these bigwigs collectively lost about $12.8 billion in market value on the day.Rite Aid Corporation Price  Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteMajor drug distributors like Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) also panicked, with stocks falling a respective 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.1%.How Rational is the Deal for Amazon?In an era where brick and mortar set ups are being challenged by online sellers, though Amazon’s entry into the prescription drug industry is welcome news for consumers, it is also fraught with challenges.Coming back to the buyout, PillPack is an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. It also holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and has URAC and VIPPS accreditation. It is an in-network pharmacy with most pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) along with major Medicare Part D plans.Per an article on STAT, the integration of PillPack will help Amazon become a major player in the $370-billion drug business.Some analysts believe that with PillPack, which is working with Medicare plans, Amazon will be able to see an increase in its Amazon Prime membership of the rapidly-growing age group of 65 and above. There are high chances that 100 million Prime subscribers with Amazon will choose the company for their prescription drug needs.However, the deal has come with its own set of challenges. Per an article published on PYMNTS.com, PillPack sources products from AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots. Further, per the same article,  there were rumors in the recent past about Walgreens Boots’ plans to buy AmerisourceBergen, which might pit Walgreens Boots against Amazon in the space.PillPack’s in-network membership with Express Scripts is also subject to renewal at the end of July. It is being speculated that if Amazon appears to be a formidable threat to the PBMs they might start refraining from renewing the in-network memberships in future (per an article published on PYMNTS.com). With regard to this, Amazon had to let go of its 40% stake in Drugstore.com as PBMs denied to include Drugstore.com in their networks. This  eventually resulted in Drugstore.com exiting the prescription business (per an article published on AXIOS).How Bad is the News for Pharmaceutical Giants? ""You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.""Nothing could more aptly sum up this situation than this remark by Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO. The incumbent players in the drugstore industry don’t seem to be in a mood to give up and lose their turf. To counter competition, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and others have started to add more digital and customer-friendly programs. These companies have incorporated mail order pharmacy models to their stores with same day/one day to two days delivery programs.Further, CVS Health’s deal with United States’ third-largest health insurance company, Aetna, will fortify its position in the industry.In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens Boots has tied up with Express Scripts and has announced plans to expand existing group purchasing efforts. Per reports, Walgreens Boots is also collaborating with a number of healthcare businesses, including health insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group.The company is also partnering with lab testing provider Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to expand the range of health services at its stores.Further, some analysts believe those preferring cash payments are expected to opt more for Amazon’s pharmacy services. The percentage of this population is quite nominal. Moreover, patients with the need for immediate drugs will approach stores over waiting for online delivery.Considering these factors, major analysts believe there is enough scope left for these behemoths to maintain a competitive edge in the space.Summing UpAmazon’s entry has definitely created an upheaval in the prescription drug industry with major players struggling to keep afloat. However, in business, bankable human resource and strong financial position matter the most. And Amazon has an adequate amount of of both. So, the following quote from Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, Reuters suitably sums up the current scenario — “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1004,AET,"When it comes to merger, the Healthcare sector steals the show. The U.S. healthcare supply chain is consolidating fast, with deals across the industry ranging from insurers, pharmacies to drug distributors. The last four years were pretty solid for global healthcare mergers.According to an analysis by Kaufman Hall, 87 hospitals were merged through the third quarter of 2017, against 102 overall in 2016. Among these, eight transactions comprised hospitals with $1 billion or more in revenues, double the big-ticket mergers in 2016.Hospitals and health systems announced 561 transactions consisting about 1,260 hospitals from 2010 to 2015, according to the American Hospital Association. Health insurers are also striving to cut deals in this field.Some noted deals planned in the recent past include UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) (the biggest U.S. health insurer) $4.9 billion deal to acquire DaVita Medical Group and CVS Health Corp.’s (CVS  -  Free Report) acquisition plans for Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) (one of the top U.S. health insurers), for about $67.5 billion in cash and stock. CVS’s acquisition of Aetna is expected to close in 2H 2018.

1005,AET,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is progressing well toward the completion of its pending merger with the grocer, Albertsons Companies, Inc. The progress of the deal became evident, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) made the previously filed registration statement on Form S-4 effective.Following this, Rite Aid is now urging its shareholders to vote in favor of the merger deal. Voting, regarding the proposed transaction, will be carried out in the Special Meeting of Rite Aid shareholders, which is scheduled for Aug 9, 2018. Rite Aid’s shareholders, with record as of Jun 22, 2018, are entitled to cast votes in connection with the proposed deal.Though Rite Aid’s shares haven’t witnessed much positive momentum lately, we believe that the deal, after the completion, can begin a new chapter to its story. Shares of Rite Aid have declined nearly 6.9% on Jun 26. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 17.4% in the last three months, driven by optimism stemming from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the aforementioned merger developments. The company has outperformed the industry’s increase of 6.9%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The BackgroundRite Aid had agreed to merge with the largest grocer in the country, Albertsons, on Feb 18, 2018. The merger will not only help revive the distressed business of Rite Aid but also help in dispelling the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, Rite Aid’s shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash, or only its shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash, or only 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave shareholders of Rite Aid with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own a 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.The new company will operate about 4,900 locations, including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. It will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies’ plan to re-banner most of Albertsons’ pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores, following the completion of the transaction while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-alone pharmacies.The merger is approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar 2018, conditioned upon the receipt of approval from Rite Aid’s shareholders, and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.The drugstore industry, in general, has been witnessing increased consolidation lately. After the failed merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the industry has seen CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) enter a $69-billion deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018. While the CVS-Aetna deal is on track, Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp.

1007,AET,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) has achieved a historic feat yesterday on emerging as the youngest participant on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) or DJIA. This is a momentous exploit not just because this goliath stock has entered the world’s most coveted index but more so for dramatically replacing Dow’s oldest member, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report). With this success, Walgreens stalled GE’s uninterrupted run on the exchange for 110 long years.The change will be effective Jun 26 market opening.Let’s delve deeper into the significance of the decision for Dow investors.GE Booted Off: How Far is This Logical?The S&P Dow Jones indices report says that “General Electric was an original member of the DJIA in 1896 and a member continuously since 1907”. However, per the index, this decision was prompted by the GE stock’s persistent trading at a low price of late, which affected the entire index’s price performance in turn. Going by the report, “the DJIA is a price-weighted index and the range of prices among its 30 constitutes matter. The low price of GE shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point.”Overall, GE’s market capitalization rose to $594 billion in 2000 and has shrunk unbelievably over the years to $111.87 billion at present.Over the past year, shares of GE have nose-dived by more than 50%, a significant plunge justifying the above logic. If we compare the stock with its broader industry, the stock has plummeted 52.1% compared with the industry’s 16.7% decline.For the same time frame, DJIA has rallied 16.9% and another sought-after index, S&P 500, remained slightly below at 13.7% growth. Both indices however, remained far above the General Electric’s tally. Walgreens’ DJIA Foray: Does it Make Sense?While talking about the decision to incorporate Walgreens on the DJIA index, the S&P Dow Jones indices report informed that Walgreens will contribute more meaningfully to the index as its share price is higher than GE’s. The stock will also help the index represent the U.S. market and economy in a better way.The investment world has already been dissected into two with respect to this impactful decision. Per David Blitzer, chairman of the S&P’s index committee, industrial companies like GE no longer hold prominence in the American economy, whereas healthcare, banks, tech and consumer companies race as front runners now.From Walgreens’ point of view, this world’s first pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise has never has been shoved away from the limelight, courtesy of its consistent flow of strategic developments. The company has been formed through the combination of legacy Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The merger brought together a couple of companies with compelling portfolios and iconic brands, complementary geographies, shared values and trusted health care services via pharmaceutical wholesaling and community pharmacy care.Recently, in a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens has tied up with Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) and announced plans to expand their existing group purchasing efforts. Also, Walgreens’ Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational as well as financial benefits.Following the news, shares of Walgreens gained 5.24% to $68 at yesterday’s close.The Opposite ViewOn the flip side, some are questioning the practicality of substitution as CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a bigger contender of Walgreens in the similar field in terms of market cap, volume and prescription revenues.According to the analysts, Walgreens incurred immense debt to maintain its expansion through acquisition strategy.The company’s long-term debt shot up to $12.5 billion as of February 2018 from $3.7 billion in August 2013 (per a Wall Street Journal report).Moreover, while CVS Health is currently in the process to complete its $69-billion Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, its decision to buy the health insurerhas been taken quite positively by the investment world. Economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s mounting health-care costs. In spite of this huge prospect, CVS Health not present in the list of 30 Dow members is putting the investors in sort of dilemma. Walgreens’ stock performance too is currently not looking much convincing. Over the past year, shares of Walgreens have lost 17.9%, outperforming the DJIA and S&P 500 index. The broader industry has witnessed a 10.7% decline. Per a Bloomberg report, “On paper, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is an underwhelming choice for inclusion in the world’s most famous stock index.”How Significant the ‘Delete’ & ‘Replacement’ Will Be?According to many investment experts, the General Electric-Walgreens case is more of a publicity stance for Dow, gradually losing its sheen since the economic recession of the 1990s. Going by a Reuters’ article, “GE is currently the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value, and it sports the index’s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.”A Lipper data also concluded that while just $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds attached to the Dow, ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index, have assets of around $380 billion. Undoubtedly, next week, GE’s exit and Walgreens’ entry may not have any relevant effect on the performance of the index.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1008,AET,"The much talked about and widely speculated foray of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) into the healthcare space is shaping up, with the appointment of the CEO of their healthcare company.The three heavyweights formed a healthcare alliance early during the year and have been hunting for the best fit to helm its affairs. Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, will head the new company, to be based out of Boston, from Jul 9.Despite no prior background in running a healthcare company, the company will bank on Gawande’s analytical acumen to cope with issues plaguing the current healthcare practices in the United States. Per Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, Gawande possesses the qualities of “an expert’s knowledge, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation”Frustrated with soaring healthcare costs, the three companies have come together to primarily take care of the healthcare needs of more than a million of their employees.  Warren Buffett recently called healthcare cost ""the hungry tapeworm on the American economy.""  Amazon has, however, expressed interest in the pharmacy space also.The  new company will operate as an independent entity, free from profit-making incentives and constraints.The news of the possibility of these companies making an entry into healthcare space late last year sent shockwaves through the industry with the existing players fearing a disruption. Led by concerns of market share loss and a tough competitive environment that might be the beginning of a number of mergers and acquisitions have been announced and taken place since then, setting the trend of cross consolidation in the healthcare industry.Existing companies in the space are making all efforts to gain in size and scale to tightly hold on to their ground when the winds of change blow.Some of the deals in this vein are that of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation, Express Scripts by Cigna Corp., purchase of the primary care unit of DaVita by UnitedHealth Group Inc., Rite Aid’s merger with Albertson's, and Walgreens Boots Alliance partnership with Humana to set up primary care clinics. All these companies are seemingly doing their homework and getting ready to face the radical changes to be bought by the new comers.There is no doubt that the entry of these most influential companies (especially Amazon, which has successfully turned the tide in its favor in whatever business it has laid its hands on thus far) is a shot across the bow to the traditional healthcare system in the United States and could unsettle the industry. While the companies have come together to manage healthcare costs for their own employees, it would not come as a surprise if they start providing service to the public at large.These companies, with their established brands, huge customer data, cutting-edge technology and superior product and services, should lead to a radical healthcare transformation. It is expected that the solutions created by them will to a large extent solve the three main challenges of the healthcare sector — access, quality and cost.  A shift from “one-size-fits-all” care treatment to “tailor made care” should be in vogue, as these customer-centric companies try to design customer-specific products and services compared with traditional healthcare players that have hardly ever extended such care to customers.Considering the health insurance industry, which was concentrated on a handful of big players that command product pricing and service offerings, and had an upper hand in dealing with customers, will find themselves in a radically changed scenario. Players in this space have already had to make fundamental changes in their business operations and attitude since the enactment of Obamacare in 2010 that put a check on malpractices to protect customers’ interest. Now, the entry of players that are already well established in their own fields and enjoy customer loyalty, will give traditional healthcare players a jolt.It will, however, not be a cake walk for these new entrants to establish themselves very soon in the healthcare industry. The need of the hour for healthcare entities is razor-sharp focus on innovation and service to protect their share in a market that they have ruled for ages.Among the companies mention above, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Berkshire Hathaway carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1009,AET,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has decided to collaborate with Walgreens for providing better primary and other services to senior citizens via primary care clinics. Notably, Walgreens is a provider of trusted care, included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report). This alliance is part of the ongoing and shared commitment of both companies to the health and well-being of the Kansas City community.The partnership forged between Humana, a leading health and well-being company and Walgreens, the provider of trusted pharmacy services and care would essentially create a senior-focused neighborhood approach to health, which would include primary care, pharmacy, in-person health plan support and additional services for Medicare beneficiaries. The companies are also interested in expanding this collaboration into other markets in the near future.Partners in Primary Care, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana, would operate senior-focused primary care clinics (on a pilot basis) in two Walgreens stores in the Kansas City, Missouri area. Located most conveniently, the clinics are expected to open doors this fall with a spacious area of around 2,500 square feet and would complement Walgreens pharmacy services along with the four Partners in Primary Care centers, inaugurated last year in Kansas City.The clinics cater to aged people participating in a few Medicare plans. Partners in Primary Care focus on offering care services beyond addressing just the acute and immediate health issues. Additionally, the unit caters to developing long-term relationships with patients suffering chronic conditions.Humana currently provides health-related programming and resources to its more than 65,000 Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone Part D Prescription Drug plan members in the region. While Walgreens supports more than 75,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Kansas City community through above 50 neighborhood pharmacies and other points of care.Humana expects its initiative with Walgreens to deliver a way simpler and better experience for people, which would in turn encourage them to take care of their health more seriously while being closely in touch with the doctors. This senior-focused care by the company is a continuation of its strategy to revolve around integrating care via clinical programs intersecting health with lifestyle. The humanitarian service also supports Humana’s multi-faceted approach to healthcare in general.The win-win program has aided Walgreens to expand its pharmacy services and expertise plus drive the digital tools and other programs, aimed at helping the grey populace in the community. It is one of Walgreens’ efforts to make cost-effective healthcare accessible to patients, providing them with a value-for-money experience.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 20.86% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.87%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This deal charts out the obvious course of action for Walgreens as it braces itself well for handling the pressing competition from the likely entry of Amazon in the pharmacy business. Also, CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) is on track to acquire Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), which should expand the combined entity’s scale and size in the industry.These health-oriented pacts point to the blurring of the boundaries between two subsectors of the healthcare industry such as, the pharmacies and drug stores and health insurers. These alliances are a way forward for the companies, striving to emerge as comprehensive healthcare players and cost controllers. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1010,AET,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of Aspire Health, a non-hospice, community-based palliative care provider. The deal is aimed at providing unique and innovative medical care to the community outside hospitals.The company anticipates the buyout to be neutral to current-year earnings but accretive to the bottom line in 2019.Aspire Health provides services under contracts with above 20 health plans to patients across 25 U.S. states. The company identifies patients suffering serious illnesses and helps them fight fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, appetite loss and depression through supreme medical care.Anthem already owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and purchasing Aspire Health would enable it to enhance its medical care business, providing better services along with other clinical care assets, namely CareMore Health and AIM Specialty Health. Through this transaction, Anthem plans to introduce advanced illness programs to deliver optimum patient satisfaction via home-based care, reducing medical costs in the process.Palliative care is fast gaining ground as the U.S. healthcare system shifts to value based care from a volume based one. The consolidation should aid Anthem to dispense treatment affordable costs to patients with complex medical conditions. Thus this move might effectively lower overall medical costs, boosting margin expansion in the process.The Aspire Health deal is projected to be a kind of vertical integration for Anthem and will craft it into a more wholesome and integrated healthcare service provider.Vertical tie-ups are anyways in vogue in the healthcare industry with two mega deals comprising Express Scripts Holding Company by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) being already underway.

1011,AET,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) the health insurer major has carved a niche for itself in the health care industry by building up pieces of businesses that has given it enormous diversification benefits, both across product and geography.UnitedHealth’s business diversification has been achieved by fortifying its health service business, Optum, which over the years has grown to claim a greater share of the company’s total revenues. One of the main reasons for the company to nurture this business was that it remained largely insulated from the regulation which is applicable to another segment UnitedHealthcare, still the major contributor to total revenues.UnitedHealth has complemented its organic growth with targeted acquisitions that have helped it to achieve more in much lesser time. Its Optum business which provides services via three business segments — OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx — provide service capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health management, health care delivery and health care operations. Together, these capabilities represent a $1.4 trillion market opportunity, which implies huge growth for years to come.Coming to the other segment, UnitedHealthcare, has grown organically by more than 12 million people domestically since 2010, achieved via balanced, vibrant growth, serving increasingly diverse markets. The growth profile should continue given the company’s strong standing in the government business, which presents immense potential.  UnitedHealth is also one such company that has been able to lower medical cost for its customers via Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). These ACOs are groups of providers that are paid on the quality of service provided and not on the quantity of service provided as prevailed earlier.The company currently delivers more than $60 billion in care annually through contracts, with value-based features and is on course to raise that number to $75 billion by 2020.We expect the company’s impressive growth to continue as it remains an active acquirer of other businesses to strengthen an existing business or platform or provide a new platform for future growth or avail tools, technologies or skills that cannot be otherwise obtained or developed more efficiently.Moreover, in 2018 and beyond, we see the potential for sustained growth across markets served by the company, particularly in expanding government programs.Also, UnitedHealth remains the frontrunner in applying digital tools and data for health decision-making for its consumers. It is also using blockchain technology in its operations, which should enhance its overall business efficiency.Year to date, the stock has gained 14% compared with the industry’s growth of 12%. Its performance looks better than the growth of 4% and 5% for Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), respectively, over the same time frame.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering in the same space is Humana Inc.

1012,AET,"After a six-week trial, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. This will give the pay-TV provider an ownership of cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros. AT&T vowed to close the deal by Jun 20.  This long-awaited decision will change the landscape of the media industry by setting the stage for mergers of media companies and telecom providers. Cable operator, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has also been eyeing  the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA for as much as $60 billion, should regulators approve AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner.The expected move would create a bidding war for The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets of Fox for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition of Fox assets will enhance the streaming and television content of both Comcast and Disney and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, Comcast would become the biggest player in Hollywood by acquiring Fox (read: Comcast Might Thwart Disney-Fox Deal: Media ETFs in Focus).Fox’s film production business includes Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000, and the highest grossing Marvel movies - X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool. Fox TV film studio includes This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider, Sky.The ruling has also opened doors for AT&T’s biggest rival Verizon Communication (VZ  -  Free Report) to bid for a media company. The potential target of Verizon is the combined CBS Corp (CBS  -  Free Report) and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report). Other media stocks like Charter Communications CHTR, Dish Network (DISH  -  Free Report), and Discovery DISCA are also in the spotlight in light of the merger mania.Additionally, the verdict has spread optimism beyond the media space as well. It would aid the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint (S  -  Free Report) combination and a pair of significant healthcare deals. This includes the potential buyout of the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna AET by a drug chain CVS Health Corp CVS and the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding ESRX by Cigna (C  -  Free Report)I) (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).How to Play?Investors seeking to capitalize on the upcoming boom in M&A activities and potential reshaping of the media industry should consider any of the following ETFs:IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF MNA This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge.

The product has amassed $556.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 129,000 shares a day.

1013,AET,"Once again efforts are being made to repeal and replace Obamacare via the Graham-Cassidy bill.This bill is another attempt to undo Obamacare, after repeal and replace efforts by Trump hit the rocks due to insufficient votes.The ChangesA number of proposals included in the plan would alter Obamacare. Among  the most unpopular of these are putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, elimination of  Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, and ending of cost sharing subsidies by 2020.Strict provisions relating to pre-existing conditions are also likely to be loosened. While insurers will have to provide coverage for pre-existing conditions (something that Obamacare also required), they will have the ability to charge more to sicker patients.Concerns of Industry ParticipantsIn a letter addressed to the leaders McConnell and Schumer, America’s Health Insurance Plans (“AHIP”) expressed its concerns that the bill, if passed, might have on the health care industry. The group is of the opinion that the proposal fails to stabilize the individual insurance market, which provides subsidized plans to low-income people. It will also cause people with pre-existing conditions to fall out of the insurance net and disrupt the Medicaid market. This would make health insurance less affordable and unattractive, ultimately causing more people to forego insurance, thereby leading to an increase in the uninsured rate.Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of the sprawling Kaiser Permanente nonprofit health system, also holds a similar view on the proposal.Overall, the various participants of the health care sector remain unsupportive of the bill and are lobbying against it.Impact on Health Care CompaniesThe companies having high exposure to exchange business and Medicaid such as Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Health Care (MOH  -  Free Report) are likely to suffer the maximum earnings decline.Hospital companies in general are expected to suffer from the likely increase in uninsured patients which will lead to a rise in uncompensated care and consequently increase their bad debt. Volumes will also be expected to remain under pressure as people shy away from medical help due to high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.Nevertheless, companies having more diversified operations such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna are relatively better positioned to sail through.The concern was reflected in the decline of 0.8% in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) on Sep 19, just after the proposal was made.The health care sector has been in the limelight since Donald Trump took charge. Thenumerous proposals of repeal and replace , from time to time, has sent shock waves across the industry. The sector however, has been able to shrug off all concerns and perform strongly as evident by a gain of 18.8% year to date compared with the 11% returns by the S&P 500.  Going ForwardSep 30, is the deadline for the bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote (50 rather than 60), under the rules of reconciliation. The bill is fast gaining support, this time also likely from a key Republican governor, Doug Ducey of Arizona. This could lug along the support of Senator John McCain, who voted against the last repeal bill.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1015,AET,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has announced organizational changes, which include a realignment of its top brass and a stock repurchase plan.These changes are aimed at bolstering its leadership team as it transitions from an operator of ambulatory surgery services to a leading diversified healthcare services organization.The company announced succession plans for current CFO Claire Gulmi and the President of Physician Services, Bob Coward.Gulmi will be succeeded by Kevin Eastridge, currently the Chief Accounting Officer. Coward’s responsibility will be taken over by Brian Jackson, who is presently Chief Operating Officer for the Physician Services Group.The company also created a new role, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to be held by Karey Witty who will report to CEO Chris Holden. Also, Kevin Eastridge (current Chief Accounting Officer) will be appointed CFO, effective Oct 2, although Gulmi will remain an advisor to the company for a year to assist in the transition.The new leadership comprising seasoned healthcare executives with vast experience is expected to steer the company to new heights.The company also authorized a program to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock. This buyback represents nearly 4% of the company’s current market capitalization.Envision Healthcare is rapidly transforming its business after its merger with AMSURG last December. The merger created the nation's largest physician-staffing company, with more than 19,000 physicians and clinicians and annual revenues of more than $10 billion.The company is now focusing on expanding its core business of physician services. In this vein, it recently announced that it will divest its medical transportation business, known as American Medical Response, to KKR & Co. in an all-cash deal valued at $2.4 billion.Year to date, the stock has lost 32% significantly underperforming the decline of 4% suffered by the industry it belongs to. We believe these transformational steps will address investors’ concern to some extent regarding the stock’s underperformance.These developments mark significant steps in building the new Envision Healthcare  around a set of physician-centric clinical solutions to better serve the hospital system and payer clients.The merger and related transformation is expected to enhance overall growth at Envision Healthcare and evolve it into a better company with a superior return on capital trajectory.Envision Healthcare caries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1016,AET,"Mednax, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) has been plagued by a number of headwinds, of late, leading investors to lose optimism on the stock. Also, this tepid scenario doesn’t seem to reverse anytime soon.Meanwhile, a subdued pace of birth in neonatology and a change in payor mix in anesthesiology have kept the top line under pressure in both of the company’s businesses. Additionally, growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists and spike in interest expenses have pressurized margins.  These factors led to an earnings miss in the last quarter. Also, earnings missed in each of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 5.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings were also revised 7.6% and 11.5% downward, respectively, over the last 60 days.Furthermore, Mednax’s headwinds have taken a toll on its share price that declined 35% year to date, underperforming 2.7% growth registered by the industry it belongs to.Let’s take a look at other factors that have affected the price of the stock carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Disappointing Earnings – The stock has been hurt by its disappointing performance in the first half of 2017. Mednax witnessed a 10.5%, 15.8% and 0.8% year-over-year declines in EBIDTA, adjusted EPS and cash flow from operations, respectively.  Fundamental headwinds – The company is suffering from a subdued pace of birth across the country, which has slowed growth of one of its core businesses — neonatology — which has in turn stressed revenue growth.  Moreover, a change in payor mix in its anesthesiology business has pressurized its commercial volumes. This segment also suffers from growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists.Additionally, Mednax’s results have suffered due to huge investments made in diversification. These investments might create volatility in its quarter-over-quarter performance, before reaping long-term growth.Markedly, increase in expenses as a proportion of revenues owing to growth in compensation expense for supporting acquisition-related growth further pressurized the margins. Also, growth at existing units including compensation for non-physician clinicians increased at a faster pace than in the previous periods.In fact, the company has been witnessing a dent in its bottom line led by a spike in its interest expenses for more than three years.  It is also suffering from an increase in overall expenses, which has outpaced revenue growth compared with the last many years.Lackluster Earnings Guidance – Mednax expects earnings per share for the three months (ending Sep 30, 2017) to be in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents, down from $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS will likely be in the range of 83 cents to 88 cents, down from $1.09 per share in third quarter of 2016.The range for its third-quarter guidance assumes anticipated same-unit revenue of negative 2% to flat year over year. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects EBITDA to decline by 17% to 21% year over year, as against growth of 7.7% in last-year period.Going ForwardPer management, the challenges in its business are expected to continue in the near term. We thus expect shares of the company to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the medical sector include Aetna Inc.

1017,AET,"Public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been too successful in serving the insurers. This is evident from losses incurred by most of the health insurers participating in these exchanges.Affordability-Risk Pool Trade OffThe exchanges saw a deluge of very sick patients buying insurance cover online, thanks to the subsidies provided to the enrollees. They, however, failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individual, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. This led to increase in claims on business conducted on these exchanges.Let us discuss how the big four insurers have been affected by this public exchange business.Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s largest health insurance companies, recently announced that it would pull back its participation from public exchanges, expecting a loss of $200 million in 2017. Aetna incurred pre-tax operating losses of $450 in 2016.Lackluster results from this line of business prompted the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017. Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, is another big insurer offering plans on Affordable Care Act (ACA). Anthem suffered a decline in enrollment in 2016 and the same continued in the first-half 2017.This prompted the company to scale back its participation in this loss-making business for 2018. It pulled out of exchange plans in 11 states for 2017.Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market as well as a smooth transition for consumers, uncertainty remains.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) lost more than $1 billion on the exchanges in 2015 and 2016. After two years of losing money from plans sold on the ACA insurance exchanges, it exited nearly all of the exchanges for 2017. UnitedHealth presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has already declared that it will exit its Individual Commercial business in 2018. After incurring mounting losses in this business in 2015 and 2016, Humana pulled back its participation from 11 states in 2016. The insurer anticipates incurring a modest $45 million loss on ACA exchange plans in 2017, excluding the effect of which, it estimates the earnings per share for 2017 to be at least $11.50. The company also carries Zacks Rank #3.Continued UncertaintyThe health insurers that have been making significant losses on ACA exchange plans are uncertain about thefinal verdict from the Trump administration. This is because the administration has been vocal about removing cost reduction subsides that help insurance companies pay claims of patients buying coverage on public exchanges.These players have been lobbying to keep these subsidies intact, which would otherwise lead to the health plan enrollees facing cost increases of 20-25% for 2018 coverage.The U.S. Senate is working on a bipartisan approach for shoring up the ACA’s public exchanges by funding cost-sharing subsidies for low income patients.The uncertainty on the CSR funding puts a question mark on the sustainability of these  exchanges. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, it will not be surprising to see an exodus of insurance companies from these exchanges.  This exit will lead to more Americans finding themselves with fewer healthcare options, causing an increase in uninsured rates, defeating the central tenet of the Health Care Reform Act.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

1018,AET,"Obamacare repeal efforts have once again picked pace this time with U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Dean Heller (R-NV), Ron Johnson (R-WI) and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) unveiling legislation to reform health care last week.The legislation, commonly referred to as the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson (“GCHJ”) bill or the Graham-Cassidy bill, proposes the repeal of Obamacare and its replacement with a block grant that will be given to states every year to help individuals pay for health care. The bill will give states a lot of freedom to decide how the money will be used to take care of the health needs of patients. States will get more flexibility as well as resources to create healthcare systems with lower premiums and expanded coverage.The grant money would replace the federal dollars currently spent on Medicaid expansion, Obamacare tax credits, cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the basic health plan dollars. The proposal also aims to remove the inequity of four states receiving 37% of Obamacare funds and brings all states to funding parity by 2026.Key Points of the Graham-Cassidy BillTo sum up, the key points of the Graham-Cassidy bill are the repeal of Obamacare individual and employer mandates as well as the Obamacare medical device tax, strengthening the ability of states to waive Obamacare regulations, returning power to the states and patients by equalizing the treatment between Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states through an equitable block grant distribution and protecting patients with pre-existing medical conditions.The CBO’s TakeA preliminary report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) will be out by early next week though the CBO said that it will be at least several weeks before it will be able to provide estimates of the effects of the bill on the deficit, health insurance coverage, or premiums.The preliminary report will include information as to whether the bill would lower on-budget deficits by at least as much as was estimated for the American Health Care Act (as passed by the House on May 4, 2017), whether Titles I and II in the legislation would save at least $1 billion each and whether the bill would increase on-budget deficits in the long term.What Next?The next step for the Graham-Cassidy bill is for it to pass the Senate where 50 votes are needed. This may well prove to be a tough task - the Senate has only 52 Republicans and one of them, Sen. Rand Paul, has already said that he will oppose the bill. That leaves a very narrow margin for the bill to be passed successfully.Moreover, the goal is to pass the bill before Sep 30, which means a very tight deadline within which Republicans will have to decide their stand on the bill. The job is made even tougher by the fact that the full CBO report will not be available by then and the Senators will only have the preliminary report to bank on for information on the impact of the bill especially regarding premium and coverage.Previous attempts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” did not meet with much success. A quick recap of the events that unfolded over the past few months shows that “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” has been a key goal for President Trump who had said that his first course of action, once elected, for Obamacare would be to ask Congress to repeal it immediately. However, the President and Republican party leaders first suffered a setback in March this year with a healthcare bill (the American Healthcare Act or Trumpcare) being pulled from the House floor when it became clear that there would not be enough votes to pass the bill.Then in June, the Senate issued its version, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, with certain changes being made - however, four Republican Senators (Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and Mike Lee) issued a joint statement saying that they were not ready to vote for the bill due to several reasons but were open to negotiation and obtaining more information before the bill was brought to the floor.The Senate then came out with a revised version of its bill but this too failed to garner full support. With efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing, the focus shifted to repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement - the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017.Hospital and Insurance Stocks in FocusAs the latest Obamacare scenario plays out, healthcare stocks will remain in focus in the coming days. Hospital stocks started the year on a strong note though this sector will be under pressure if Obamacare gets repealed without a suitable replacement. This is because hospitals benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage. Repealing and/or replacing Obamacare without a suitable replacement would result in a significant increase in the uninsured population which does not bode well for hospitals. The Hospital industry, which is currently among the bottom 10% of the Zacks-ranked industries, while up 2.7% year to date, has lagged the overall market rally of 11.6%.On the other hand, insurance stocks have had a strong run this year with the industry gaining 27.1% year to date. Not surprisingly, the HMO industry is among the top 6% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With the possibility of millions of people losing coverage and weaker coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, expect volatility in this corner of the healthcare market in the near-term.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

1019,AET,"Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward revisions over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved north by 6.1% and 2%, respectively.The company’s continued investments to strengthen its position in a rapidly evolving health insurance industry and focus on being consumer centric are expected to drive performance.In fact, Aetna surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19%.Presently, Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an impressive Value Score of B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, handily outperform others.Aetna’s share price performance also remains impressive. Its shares have gained 31.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 27% as well as the S&P 500’s 11.6% returns.Why is Aetna an Attractive Pick?Increase in Earnings Guidance: Based on strong second-quarter earnings, which benefited from higher premium revenues and low medical cost ratios, the company upped its 2017 earnings guidance.It now estimates earnings between $9.45 and $9.55 per share (versus the previous guidance of $8.80 to $8.90). The midpoint of this range represents a 15% increase from $8.21 per share in 2016. This strong earnings guidance instills confidence in the company’s ability to sail through stringent and uncertain regulations.Bottom-Line Growth: Aetna’s earnings per share have grown since 2010 (save 2012 which saw a 0.2% decline). This has been achieved through growth in premium along with expense management and share buybacks. A strong guidance for 2017 is being viewed favorably by investors.Cost Control: Aetna has been witnessing an improvement in adjusted operating expense ratio which testifies to its commitment to drive productivity and disciplined focus on managing operating costs. A decline in expenses has given a thrust to the company’s bottom-line growth.Aetna expects 2017 adjusted expense ratio between 17.3% and 17.5% (versus the previous guidance of 16.9%). This increase will be driven by the rise in targeted growth-initiative investments. Despite the increase from the previous guidance, the targeted expense ratio for 2017 represents a year-over-year decline (calculated at mid-point) of 70 basis points.Strong ROE: Further, Aetna’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 20.5% reinforces its growth potential. Its ROE has increased in the past three years and is higher than ROE of 19% for the industry, reflecting is tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Stock is Undervalued: Aetna’s valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company is currently trading at a one-year forward P/E ratio of 17.1, which is lower than 19.8 for the S&P 500 index and 19.4 for the industry.Other StocksSome other stocks from the space with the same Zacks Rank as Aetna are Centene Corp.

1020,AET,"The performance of a stock depends on a number of factors. While changes in company fundamentals directly impact price movement, the broader industry and economy sometimes play a significant role too.In fact, studies have shown that an average stock in a strong industry is likely to perform better than an exceptional stock from an industry that has fallen out of favor with investors. Therefore, a combination of top-performing industries and stocks with the potential to shine will surely enhance your investment portfolio. This is also called top-down investing.Though finding the top industries is not easy, the Zacks Industry Rank makes this task relatively simple.Zacks Industry RankA top Zacks Industry Rank signifies that more stocks within that group are likely to witness upward earnings estimate revisions, hinting at bullishness.The Zacks Industry classification divides the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 medium or M-level industries and 260 plus or X-level industries. We rank all 260 plus X-level industries based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry.Medical HMOOne of the top-ranked industries currently is Medical HMO. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16 (top 6% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry despite being riddled with stringent regulations which reduces operating flexibility to certain extent, has witnessed a bull run for the past many years. The same is evident from growth of 354% registered by the industry since the Affordable Care Act came into effect (one of the most arduous reforms which redefined the industry), compared with a rise of 117.6% for the S&P 500 index.Though past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance, the industry is perfectly poised to weather regulatory uncertainty and any changes it may lug along given its fundamental strength. We are thus confident of the bull run in the industry to continue.Growth DriversDeclining uninsured rates, increasing enrollment, expansion of product portfolio, demographic changes, new service offerings, and foray into international operations have driven overall growth of the players in the industry.However, increasing medical costs, higher expenses in the form of regulatory compliance cost, and increased investments in technology are weighing on the bottom line to some extent. Nevertheless, these investments (in technology and regulatory compliance) will aid long-term growth by making operations more automated and streamlined. Thus albeit short-term hiccups, the long-term path to the industry’s success looks clear.4 Stocks From This Industry     Along with picking a top-ranked industry, one needs to be cautious in choosing stocks to get meaningful profits.We would pick the stock on the basis of their favorable Zacks Rank, which indicates that these have been witnessing positive estimate revisions that generally translate into rapid price appreciation. The industry’s performance will add to it, too. Research says that about half the price performance of a stock can be attributed to the industry group that it belongs to.These stocks also boast a positive earnings surprise history and have generated handsome returns in a year. Moreover, these stocks have a Value Score of A or B. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.7%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved up 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively, in the last 60 days. Centene carries a Zacks Rank #2 and sports a Value Score of A.

The stock beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 19%.  Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved up 6.1% and 2% in the last 60 days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Consider Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), a firm in the Medical Health Maintenance Organizaton industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, AET has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, AET expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share, while it actually produced earnings of $2.71 per share, a beat of 14.8%.

1023,AET,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has signed a definitive agreement with Fidelis Care of New York. Per the agreement, the company would take over all Fidelis Care’s assets for $3.75 billion.Why Fidelis Care?Fidelis Care is a perfect fit for Centene given the former’s diversified leadership in government programs. Moreover, the company boasts a history of profitable operations and a healthy balance sheet. With a statewide network of approximately 70,000 providers, the company offers high quality health insurance coverage at lower costs to children and adults. The company’s offerings include Medicaid, Qualified Health Plans, Child Health Plus, Essential Plan as well as Medicare Advantage, a much sought-after market in which Centene intends to expand.This buyout would enable Centene to acquire national leadership in government sponsored healthcare in New York and also make it the second largest managed care state by membership across the United States.In addition, inclusion of New York under area of operation would provide Centene the leadership position in the four largest managed care states of the United States by membership, namely, California, Florida, New York and Texas.Will the Deal Drive Synergy?Centene expects to generate 2018 pro-forma total revenues of more than $60 billion by the end of 2017 with this buyout. The company also expects the acquisition to positively impact its GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share in the first two years after the completion of the transaction. It also anticipates to achieve $25 million of pre-tax net synergies in the first year post acquisition and $100 million run-rate synergies beginning the second year.  Synergies are expected to come from areas driven by lower medical costs through the use of Centene's systems and medical management programs.Inorganic Expansion Drives GrowthThis deal is in line with Centene’s efforts to deploy capital in numerous acquisitions and mergers aimed at expanding the company’s markets and increasing the government business. The acquisition of Health Net in 2016 has been significantly accretive to the company’s bottom line and top line. The acquisition of Fidelis Care is also likely to impact the company’s underwriting results favorably. These efforts have always been appreciated by shareholders. Year to date, its shares have gained 61%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 28%.  Centene also looks forward to bring its suite of specialty services, TruCare case management platform, and intelligence data & analytics tools and award winning clinical programs to New York to further strengthen its presence and improve operating results.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCentene presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors interested in this space can consider stocks like Aetna, Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Wellcare Health Plans, Inc.

1024,AET,"The Healthcare sector has been in the limelight since the election of President Donald Trump, a vehement opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His proposed changes (some of which go against the interest of the insurers), via the proposal to repeal and replace, raised concerns across the space.Repeal and replace, however, has been left hanging in midair due to lack of sufficient government support. Therefore, continued regulatory uncertainty persists in the sector.Industry TrendsThe health insurance industry, meanwhile, continues to grow profitably as evident from the rise in its top line, as by most companies in the recently reported quarter. Many companies like Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) raised their outlook for 2017. This is indicative of significant growth opportunities in the industry.Players in the industry are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid. Revenues of the companies dealing with these plans like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana have been witnessing consistent upticks on the back of government business.Thanks to the ACA, the industry has been benefiting from a reduction in the uninsured population that aided in medical enrollment as well as helped companies lower bad debts.Rapidly increasing business diversification, focus on ancillary services and products contributing significantly to the insurers’ revenues help the companies combat the effects of stringent regulations.Also, as the median age of the U.S. population grows, overall demand for medical coverage continues to rise.Nevertheless, health insurers continue to suffer from underperforming public exchanges as these businesses have resulted in significant losses for most of the players.Increasing operating cost related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins.Although the U.S Senate has rejected the appeal of President Trump to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform, an uncertainty has risen regarding the future of the deal. This is expected to result in higher uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States.The Congressional Budget Office’s estimation also states that reduction in government spending will lead to a loss of insurance for 23 million people over the next 10 years.Industry Rank & Price PerformanceDespite the challenges, the health insurance industry is currently ranked #20, which represents the top 8% of the Zacks Industry Rank.It has also been able to perform well as evident from its rally of 47.8% in the last one year compared with 16.4% gain registered by the S&P 500.Stocks Worth ConsideringWe bring to you three health insurance stocks that have a solid Value Score, a favorable Zacks Rank and has delivered average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters.Aetnais a provider of healthcare, dental, pharmacy, group life, disability, and long-term care benefits.

1025,AET,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than X-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are six of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Insperity, Inc. (NSP  -  Free Report) is engaged in providing an array of human resources and business solutions.

1026,AET,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is on a stellar run. Continued strong growth in membership, superior performance of business units along with solid capital position, and an upbeat outlook with strong fundamentals have propelled the stock.The same is reflected in the company’s share price, which has gained a whopping 38% year to date, significantly outdoing the mere 1.4% growth for the industry it belongs to.Cigna with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) looks all the more impressive at a time when the healthcare sector is grappling with stringent regulations and remains under considerable regulatory uncertainty. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The returns compare favorably with gains of 23.5%, 31%, 34% for UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively.  So what led the momentum in the stock?    The stock is gaining from the company’s strong performance. Its Global Supplement business has been  growing for the past many years, a trend which continued through the first half of 2017. For 2017, the company expects adjusted income from operations of $310 million to $330 million (up from the previous guidance of $295 million to $315 million), which translates into a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 9% (calculated at the midpoint).We expect the segment to grow on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent.Also, its Seniors market — Medicare Advantage (MA), MA Part D, and Medicaid businesses — is poised for strong growth. Cigna forayed into the Medicare Advantage market (where it was virtually nonexistent) by acquiring HealthSpring Inc. We expect high single-digit revenue growth from this line of business in the long term.Membership growth, which has been steady for quarters now, has been seen this year too. We expect a rise in membership going forward, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service.  For 2017, the company expects global medical customers to grow from 500,000, to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, reflecting the strong growth experienced by the company across its Commercial market segments.Its strong capital position is impressive. The company’s cash flow from operations has been increasing consistently for the last three years and the trend continued in the first half of 2017. Its disciplined capital management strategy involves investments in its business portfolio, strategic mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchases.Above all, the recent guidance raise by the company cements our confidence in the stock. Cigna expects adjusted income from operations to grow 19% to 23% (versus the previous outlook of 12% to 18%). Revenue guidance of $41.1 billion translates into a year-over-year increase of 3.5%. Cigna’s earnings per share projection of $9.75 to $10.05 (versus the previous outlook of $9.35-$9.85) hints at growth of 37.7% over 2016 (calculated at the midpoint of the guidance).Given the bunch of positives, we expect momentum in the shares of Cigna to continue in the coming quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1027,AET,"Universal Health Services, Inc.'s (UHS  -  Free Report) is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of its solid inorganic strategy. This has been contributing to the company’s growth story since long. The acquisition of the adult services division of Cambian Group in 2016 is worth a mention here.Universal Health primarily specializes in providing low cost care to underprivileged patients. Its acute care platform has been delivering strong underwriting results consistently. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.In addition, its behavioral platform has been performing well too. In fact, behavioral facility acquisitions help Universal Health win market share in the fast growing addiction and mental health disorder market. The segment continued to deliver strong results in the first half of 2017.In the last six months, the stock has lost 9.4%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 11%. This reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock despite the challenging environment.However, the stock currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 1.1. This, although is below the median 1.2 of its range, it compares unfavorably with the industry average of 0.5. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its peers. In addition, the company’s high-debt level has been a concern over the last five years. This also led to a rise in interest expenses which could weigh on its margins.Another area of concern for the company is the increase in its operating expenses since 2013, which continued to rise in the first half of 2017. This also keeps hurting the company’s bottom line.Zacks Rank and Key PicksUniversal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Investors interested in this space can consider stocks like Aetna, Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem, Inc.

1028,AET,"Continued strong demand for mental and behavioral health and support from government for increased funding for opioid addiction programs along with strong fundamentals have driven growth at Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report).The same is reflected in the company’s share price, which has gained a whopping 42% year to date, significantly outdoing the mere 3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Acadia Healthcare’s performance looks all the more superb when compared with the meager gain of 1.7% by another player, United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) in the same space.So what led the momentum in the stock?Favorable Industry TrendsAcadia Healthcare, a behavioral health care company, has been favored by spending on behavioral health services that has more than doubled in a decade. The company has witnessed an increase in the number of patient growth after the passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act by Congress in 2008. The act required health plans and insurers to pay for addiction and mental illness treatment just as they would for cancer or cardiovascular care.Cases of behavioral and substance abuse is on the rise, which has resulted in an increased number of deaths related to this. Given the fragility of the case, it seems that new regulations in process (under Trump’s presidency) should support the industry by providing greater patient access to care, growing awareness of treatment options, and solid long-term pricing support. This should driving sales and demand for the company’s services.Strong FundamentalsOther than industry-specific factors, the stock is gaining from the company’s strong performance. Its U.K. and U.S. facilities have been performing favorably and witnessed an increase in patient admission, revenue per patient and number of patient days. The company’s  superior operating performance its evident from its revenues, which witnessed a CAGR of 67% from 2011-2016. Along with top-line growth, the bottom line has also seen an impressive CAGR of 39.34% from 2012-2016.Management’s ability to execute on inorganic growth strategies has paid off. We favorably view the company’s extensive plans for bed expansion. The company added 91 beds in the second quarter and expects to add 800 this year. While a quarter of these additions will stem from a joint venture in Louisiana, Virginia and Arkansas, the rest will come from business expansion. Management also believes that bed expansion can accelerate over the next 3-5 years.The company made a number of acquisitions in the past that have amplified its growth. It is continuously seeking acquisitions, primarily in the U.S and remains open to joint ventures. More importantly, Acadia Healthcare is a sought-out partner for acute care hospitals.Acadia Healthcare’s ambitious growth plans are supported by its strong capital position. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $371.7 million, up 50% year over year. The same was up 2.6% in the first half of 2017. Apart from pursuing acquisitions, the company plans to use excess cash to reduce debt.Given the bunch of positives, we expect momentum in the shares of Acadia Healthcare to continue in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAcadia Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the health care space are Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report). Both these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1029,AET,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report) boasts a strong inorganic growth story driven by its expertise in acquiring real estate or leasing post-acute care operations and transforming them into market leaders. These initiatives position the company well for robust organic growth.The company’s revenues have been growing since 2012. Apart from inorganic growth, the consistent strong performance by the Transitional & Skilled Services segment has also aided its top-line growth. The trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.Ensign Group’s solid financial health also paves the way for several growth oriented capital deployment strategies. The company has been paying dividends since 2002 and has increased its payout annually for the past 14 years. Frequent share repurchases and dividends payments have helped it retain investors’ confidence in this stock. In the last one year, its shares have gained 5% while the industry declined nearly 27%.However, Ensign Group’s long-term debt level has been rising since 2011. The trend continued in first-half 2017 as well. This rising level of debt not only raises financial risks but also increases interest expenses which, in turn, hurt the margins.Rising level of operating expenses also leads to increase in total expenses. This severely affects the company’s bottom line.Ensign Group’s valuation looks expensive at the current level. Looking at the company’s trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. It currently has a one-year P/S ratio of 0.6, which is above the industry average of 0.2.Zacks Rank and Key PicksEnsign Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1030,AET,"Molina Healthcare, Inc (MOH  -  Free Report) continues to grow on membership. Over last few years, aggregate membership consistently increased on the expansion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The uptrend in membership continued in the first half of 2017 as well on the back of increased Marketplace-enrollment and the acquisition of Medicaid managed care.The company’s aggressive inorganic strategies also pave the way for long-term growth. The acquisition of Universal American’s Total Care Medicaid plan in 2016 that substantially boosted the company’s Medicaid business, is worth a mention here.On the back of membership and inorganic growth, the company’s top line started witnessing consistent growth over the past few years and the trend continued in the first half of 2017 . Solid restructuring and development strategies have also significantly contributed to this top-line appreciation.In the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 28%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18%. This reflects shareholders’ optimism in the stock.However, at the end of the second quarter, it withdrew its 2017 earnings guidance owing to uncertain medical cost trends and uncertainty around the funding of Marketplace cost sharing subsidies. This might put its share price under pressure, going forward.The company has been witnessing a rise in expenses due to higher medical care costs, over the past few years. Nevertheless, it has recently taken up a restructuring plan to improve its operational efficiency per which, it estimates annualized run-rate expenses to reduce significantly in late 2018.In addition, its high debt level also raises financial risk as well as interest expenses. Rising interest expenses also hurt its margins.Molina Healthcare’s Marketplace performance has been most disappointing in Florida, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.

1031,AET,"Health insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) health services unit Optum has announced that it will acquire the health care business of The Advisory Board Company .The buyout will bolster the company’s population health management business which includes aggregation of patient data across multiple health information technology resources along with the analysis of that data into a single, actionable patient record. This synthesized data can then be used to improve both clinical and financial outcomes.Further, the acquisition is believed to be strategically attractive for Optum as it will provide cross-selling opportunities and diversification benefits.UnitedHealth has chosen Advisory Board owing to its strong market reputation, and large and important client base in its Health Care segment.Advisory Board health care segment provides three services — research, technology and consulting. These services combined with Optum’s unmatched data analytics resources, investment capacities and operational experience will help it to better serve members and clients.UnitedHealth aims to make it big in the market for population health management which is anticipated to grow significantly in the coming years.The need for population health management is becoming imperative as the healthcare payment system moves from the one based on fee-for-service and volume of patients served to one based on value, improvements in patient health, and associated decreases in healthcare costs.Consequently, we will not be surprised to see other players in the industry expanding or deploying population health management program.The board of directors of Advisory Board has approved the merger agreement. The deal valued at nearly $1.3 billion is expected to conclude in late 2017 or early 2018. However, post completion it will not be accretive to earnings in the first year.In past year shares of UnitedHealth have returned 44.6%, higher than the industry’s gain of 42.6%.UnitedHealth’s Optum business is a jewel in its crown. It remains a strong revenues and earnings growth driver. The segment provides immense diversification benefits to the company and is expected to generate long-term earnings growth in the high-teens.Management is considering the expansion of the health service business to generate 30-40% of operating income over the longer term and has been making acquisitions in the area. Moreover, the company is under-penetrated in the health service area and that investments in this field will reap benefits over the long term.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1032,AET,"On Aug 29, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) hits a 52-week high of $255.91. The improvement is believed to have been driven by strong second-quarter results, guidance raise and the recent completion of accelerated share buyback.Notably, the stock has surged 43% in the last year, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 42% but significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s rise of 12.2%.In fact, investors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strong second-quarter earnings that topped Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.3%. This uptick was owing to solid performance by both the Medicare Advantage business segment and Retail segment.The company’s raised guidance (for the second time this year) is also encouraging. Humana now expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $11.50, to be up from the previous guidance of at least $11.10 per share. The latest guidance also reflects 20% increase in earnings compared with 2016. Operating cash flow increased by approximately $200 million, primarily owing to a better financial performance.Interestingly, an upbeat guidance instills confidence in the company’s ability to perform well in a highly regulated and competitive industry.Consequently, the company announced a strong outlook for its Medicare business, one of its most significant growth drivers. It expects approximately 74% of its Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, for the year 2018, which compares favorably to its previous forecast of 37%.Going forward, Humana’s anticipates to book 2017 pre-tax earnings of approximately $85 million in its Indiividual Commercial segment compared with the previous expectation of a full-year loss of approximately $45 million.

1033,AET,"A federal judge has approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85 billion merger with Time Warner , handing the telecom giant a massive victory in what has been the most intense antitrust case in decades.Shares of AT&T sunk in after-hours trading shortly after the news, while Time Warner stock added as much as 4.5%. The judge’s decision will apparently allow AT&T to buy Time Warner without any significant conditions.Analysts have said that such a decision might limit the government’s power to restrict mergers in the future, with many pointing to potential tie-ups between CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), or Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), as deals that could be affected by this precedent.Judge Richard Leon filed the decision, which will ignite AT&T’s content ambitions and put the company in a better position to battle tech-media hybrids like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Government prosecutors attempted to argue that a combination of AT&T’s distribution network—its cellular and wired broadband infrastructure—and Time Warner’s original content—HBO, Warner Bros., and Turner Broadcasting—would create an anticompetitive environment in today’s evolving communications and media sector.Now, AT&T will leverage those new properties to create a new telecom-media behemoth.Initial investor reaction likely reflects hesitation toward the costs associated with the deal, but it is hard to think that the merger does not present exciting potential for AT&T.Want more market analysis from this author?

The news of dividend hike, a new share buyback plan, and tie-ups with a laboratory and a diagnostic company must have led to the surge in the share price.Catalysts in DetailInvestors viewed favorably UnitedHealth Group’s recent announcement to increase its quarterly dividend by 20% to 75 cents per share. The company’s current dividend yield of 1.24% is higher than 1.06% for the industry.  UnitedHealth is all the more attractive given lower dividend yields for the companies in the same space. For instance, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) currently have a dividend yield of 1.14%, 0.69% and 0.02%, respectively.UnitedHealth has been increasing dividend every year since 2010 by a good double digits. The company’s share buyback and dividend increase history till now reflects its strong balance sheet and success in generating substantial free cash. With the recent move, the company has maintained its tradition of rewarding its shareholders thus cementing their confidence in the company.The board also renewed the company’s share repurchase program, authorizing the purchase over time of 100 million shares, or approximately 10% of shares outstanding. This board action replaces the June 2014 authorization, under which there were approximately 29 million shares remaining as of May 31, 2018.Late last month, UnitedHealth Group struck two long-term deals with laboratory-services companies Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Laboratory Corp. Via these agreements the insurer intends to control  soaring medical costs, since the payment for services to these labs will be made on the quality of the service provided compared with earlier mode of payment on the basis of quantity of service.These agreements will also enable UnitedHealth to utilize patient’s data available at these labs to provide more specific services to its customers.  Other factors that have led to a consistent rise in the company’s share price are its strong first-quarter earnings and 2018 earnings guidance increase, as well as the acquisition of Empresas Banmédica, a Chilean company, early during the year.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 40% compared with the industry’s growth of 33%.Further Upside Left?The company strong fundamentals featured by its vastly diversified operations, a strong balance sheet and growing membership should drive revenues and earnings going forward. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 0.7% upward over the last 60 days which reflects analysts’ optimism.Moreover the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Style Score of A.

1035,AET,"Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) has been consistently grabbing investors’ attention, increasing their confidence in the stock’s strong operational performance.This trend is likely to continue, driven by a recent announcement of acquisitions and the receipt of Medicaid contracts. Continuing with its strong operating performance from the past many years into the first quarter as well, Centene reported solid top and bottom-line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at the end of the last reported quarter increased 6% while revenues were up 13% and earnings per share, soared 94%. The company’s efficiency and investors’ high expectations have led the stock to rally 18%, more than double the industry’s growth of 7.8% year to date.   The stock has also delivered a solid performance compared with other players like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively up 12.8% and 1.3%, while shares of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) have slipped 0.8%, year to date. What Led to the Surge The company dominates as a market leader in the Medicaid business. It was awarded state Medicaid contract in New Mexico earlier this January, in March at Arizona and in Iowa last month. A subsidiary of the company was also granted a correctional healthcare contract in Tucson, AZ. Its Washington unit is also selected for the Medicaid contract. These approvals will likely further drive the company’s revenues from this line of business. Investors favorably view the recent buyouts of the company, which are expected to expand its business and strengthen the services offerings portfolio besides contributing to its inorganic growth. In this vein, the company acquired MHM Servcies, a national provider of healthcare and staffing services to conventional systems and other governmental agencies. This consolidation adds one new state to Centene's current portfolio of13 states.In March 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), representing the company’s targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. Apart from CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services should enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to use its cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost as well as the affordable drug-impacted medical cost.Also in March, the company purchased an additional 61% investment stake in Interpreta. It is an innovative health IT company, focused on clinical and genomic data plus real-time analytics.These transactions testify Centene’s continued execution of its diversification strategy. As a strategic move, this in turn would cement its position as a healthcare enterprise and a leader in government-sponsored healthcare.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1037,AET,"It takes just one super deal to turn the odds in your favor. Did the clinical laboratory services market just spin the wheel of fortune? Let’s see what happened.On May 24, Quest Diagnostics announced an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all of the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This expanded agreement will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the expanded tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. At the same time, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, has been hogging the spotlight on the news of the company losing its exclusive right to serve UnitedHealthcare post Jan 1. Meanwhile, LabCorp announced the extension of its partnership agreement with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) the next day. Per the expanded agreement, LabCorp will serve as a preferred national laboratory for almost all of the company’s members starting next year. The extended agreement will provide in-network access to LabCorp’s complete portfolio of laboratory services to over 20 million eligible members.According to CNBC, Quest Diagnostics will lose its exclusivity to serve as a preferred laboratory partner to Aetna’s members.Notably, both the diagnostic testing lab stalwarts’ stocks have been trading higher than the S&P 500 index since May 24.Per Morgan Stanley’s analyst Ricky Goldwasser, these deals will result in the elimination of the long-time problem of contract overhang and will thereby result in a cognitive environment for pricing in the near term. He also commented ""... Labs are relative safe havens within the health care services sector.""Conforming to this idea, we believe that there are other factors which work as growth drivers for the clinical laboratory services market. Let’s delve deeper.Here we need to consider MarketsandMarkets data which shows that the global clinical laboratory services market is headed to reach a worth of $146.41 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.2% between 2017 and 2022.Most of the analysts believe an aging demography is primarily acting in favor of this. Per an article commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, 8.5% of the global population is aged 65 years and above.Strengthening emerging markets are also going to provide impetus to the burgeoning global clinical laboratory services market. According to an article published in Report Buyer, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be the largest market for the clinical laboratory services between 2017 and 2022. Growing disposable income among the middle-class people along with increasing access to state-of-the art clinical laboratory technologies will drive the upside.According to some analysts, technological advancements in the form of integrated workflow management systems and database management tools are helping the companies expand their sample processing ability every year. Meanwhile, enhancements in laboratory testing technology will continue to boost demand for laboratory services.Stocks to Watch Out ForHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the clinical laboratory services market.Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report): Based in Redwood City, CA, Genomic Health develops and markets genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, enabling physicians and patients to make treatment-related decisions.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 226.4%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Secaucus, NJ, Quest Diagnostics is a leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services in the United States and globally.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings beat being 3.4%.DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or end stage renal disease. It also provides related lab services in outpatient dialysis centers.This Zacks Rank #3 company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 0.9%.PAMA: A DownerLike all other markets, the clinical lab space has its own issues to deal with.Changes in governmental regulations may have a significant impact on company operations. In the last couple of years, several reimbursement issues have been hurting revenues. Majority of the companies are concerned about the CMS' (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) latest Medicare reimbursement reduction as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).This has been a major dampener for testing laboratories. As said by LabCorp earlier, the new PAMA rates published by CMS do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement says, “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs.”However, per an article on GenomeWeb, companies like Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report), Veracyte and Luminex Corporation among others, which have their own proprietary tests, will for obvious reasons enjoy an edge and more control over pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1039,AET,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AET due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Aetna Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Enrollment DeclinesHealth insurer Aetna Inc.’s first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.19 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 by 7.4%. Moreover, the bottom line improved 17.7% from the prior-year quarter.The year-over-year improvement in earnings was attributable to strong performance across the company’s core businesses. Also, a favorable prior-year reserve development more than offset higher-than-expected flu-related medical costs.Soft RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $15.22 billion, which declined 1.7% from the year-ago figure of $15.49 billion. This downside was primarily driven by the company’s divested domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses during fourth-quarter 2017. However, the improvement was partially offset by higher adjusted revenues in the Health Care segment.Total expense ratio of 17.9% increased 190 basis points year over year.Pre-tax margin of 10.1% expanded slightly by 10 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 47.9 million from 50.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Segmental Performance UpdateStarting from first-quarter 2018, Aetna realigned its business segments in order to be consistent with the changes brought in its management structure and internal management reporting. On the basis of this realignment, the company will now conduct its operations in the Health Care segment.The company will provide the remaining portion of its financial results in the Corporate/Other category.Health CareAdjusted revenues were $15.1 billion, up 2% year over year. This upside was attributable to higher membership in the company’s Medicare products, a positive impact of the reinstatement of HIF in 2018 along with taking on the new accounting guidance with regard to revenue recognition for the quarter under review. However, lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products as well as the company’s Medicaid products, partially offset this upside.Pre-tax adjusted earnings of $1.5 million remained flat year over year on higher membership in Medicare products and previously announced exit from individual Commercial products. However, lower membership in Aetna’s Commercial and Medicaid products substantially offset the upside.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) fell 210 basis points year over year to 80.4% due to higher medical costs, attributable to a more severe flu season during the reported quarter compared with the prior-year period.Financial PositionTotal assets were $59.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 7.3% year over year.Long-term debt decreased 4.6% year over year to $7.8 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.8% as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 37% as of Dec 31, 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower.Aetna Inc. Price and Consensus  Aetna Inc. Price and Consensus | Aetna Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AET has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a C. The stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and growth investors while momentum investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, AET has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1040,AET,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) is set to acquire Meridian Health Plans of Michigan and Illinois and MeridianRx, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) to become the top-most Medicaid provider in the aforementioned states. The company would be paying a total of $2.5 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year.With this deal, WellCare will be able to add around 1.07 million of Medicaid members in Michigan and Illinois. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is also expected to generate more than $4.3 billion in 2018 total revenues from Meridian’s businesses and acquire an integrated PBM platform. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WellCare has always pursued strategic acquisitions to accelerate its growth and strengthen its portfolio. In 2017, the company had acquired Arizona Medicaid Assets of Phoenix Health Plan and Universal American Corp.The acquisition of one of the largest privately held, for-profit managed care organizations in the United States is reminiscent of the increased merger and acquisition taking place in the healthcare industry, as the players are busy transforming their businesses to become a comprehensive healthcare provider.  In the same vein, two mega acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and that of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) are already underway.Rising medical costs, shift to value-based care, threat of competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc., demographic changes and increased regulations are some of the catalysts driving mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare industry.The WellCare and Meridian transaction is expected to add about 40 to 50 cents per share to the company’s adjusted earnings in 2019, 70-80 cents per share in 2020 and more than $1.00 per share in 2021. This is inclusive of $30-$40 million in synergies that will ramp up over the upcoming years and exclusive of one-time transaction-related expenses of $75 million to $85 million and cumulative integration-related expenses of $50 million to $60 million.WellCare expects to fund this transaction through a combination of cash in hand, an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility, issue of new equity of about $800 million to $1.2 billion, and new debt of around $600 million to $1.0 billion.The company also announced that it has secured $2.5 billion in committed bridge financing.Shares of WellCare have rallied 9.96% year to date, outperforming the industry’s average of 7.28%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1041,AET,"Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has renewed its long-term strategic partnership with LabCorp, a leading global life sciences company providing comprehensive clinical laboratory and end-to-end drug development services.Per the agreement, LabCorp will continue to serve as UnitedHealthcare’s exclusive national laboratory provider till Jan 1, 2019. However, effective this date, Quest Diagnostics will become an “in network” lab for more than 48 million enrollees covered under the UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealth has entered into a long-term agreement with Quest Diagnostic for the same.Via these agreements, UnitedHealth intends to bring the accountable care arrangements (ACOs) model of payments to the diagnostic companies. Both companies will together provide a variety of value-based programs, with the same aligned incentives and enhanced patient experience to lab services, like what we see in accountable care arrangements with UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals and 110,000 physicians.This would result in payment based on final outcome and quality of care provided compared with fee for service, which emphasized volume of care rather than quality.Under the fee-for-service model, unnecessary lab tests were prescribed by physicians which resulted in high reimbursement from insurance companies. A shift to value-based care is the need of the hour to make the healthcare system more efficient and reduce medical cost.UnitedHealth expects that within 10 years, half of all Americans will be receiving health care from physicians operating in highly evolved and coordinated value-based care designs because the outcome clearly demonstrates improved quality and consumer satisfaction while reducing the cost of health care. The company is working toward this structural shift from fragmented fee for service.Year to date the stock has gained 10.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.8%.Value-based reimbursement of services has gradually gained ground, but now all the major players Aetna Inc.

The company identifies patients suffering serious illnesses and helps them fight fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, appetite loss and depression through supreme medical care.Anthem already owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and purchasing Aspire would help it enhance its medical care business and provide better services along with its other clinical care assets such as CareMore Health and AIM.

1043,AET,"The popularity of value investing is on the rise. The success of billionaire value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores the fact. Per a July Motley Fool article, over the past 50 years, his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has yielded a compound annual return of 20.8%. This indicates that an investment of $10,000 in 1965 would be worth $88 million today.Buffett believes that proper understanding of the “intrinsic value” of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment. According to him, going by the fundamentals of value investing while picking undervalued stocks, investors need to focus on their earnings growth potential.While yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings, sales or book value are the most common value investing matrices that can easily single out stocks trading at a discount, these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock. PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/Earnings)/ Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B (Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.)Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1045,AET,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) has been growing on buyouts. During 2010-15, the company had made some major acquisitions that expanded its markets and increased its Medicaid membership. On the back of substantial growth in existing markets, expansion into new markets and broadening of its product offerings, the top line of the company witnessed a five-year (2011-16) compound annual growth rate of 50%. In 2017, the trend continued on the back of Health Net acquisition that added significantly to its top line.Year to date, its shares have gained 53%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 25%. This indicates shareholders’ optimism on the stock.Centene’s strong balance sheet continues to impress. Its solid cash position supports its organic and inorganic investments. For the first half of 2017, the company reported $942 million of operating cash-inflow against an outflow of $223 million in the year-ago quarter.However, the company is burdened with high level of long-term debt that has been consistently rising since 2005. This not only increases the financial risk but also raises interest expenses, which again hurt margins. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.Moreover, its total expenses also kept rising since 2007 due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and premium tax costs.Its trailing 12-months return on equity of 14.6 not only deteriorated but also compares unfavorably with the industry average of 20.0, indicating that the company is less efficient in using investors’ fund.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCentene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1046,AET,"Telehealth company Teladoc, Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) has incurred significant losses in each reporting cycle since its inception.As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had an accumulated deficit of $204.7 million. For the first half of 2017, net loss was $31.1 million, 3% higher year over year. These losses and accumulated deficit stemmed from substantial investments made by the company to acquire new clients, build its proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop its technology platform.Accordingly, we anticipate that cost of revenues and operating expenses will increase substantially in the near future. These initiatives may prove to be more expensive than currently estimated by the company and may not succeed in increasing its revenues sufficiently to offset higher expenses.For 2017, Teladoc is anticipated to report a loss of $1.52–$1.55 per share (down 12% year over year). The company’s prior losses, combined with its expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on its stockholders’ equity and working capital.The company’s operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and it intends to continue making significant investments to support its business growth. In each of the past three years, the company used cash flow from operations. We believe the company has a long way to go before it starts generating positive cash flow from operations.Also, the company’s debt has increased substantially in the past four years, leading to a spike in interest costs and consequently raising overall expense and eroding operating margin.Over the past three months, the stock has lost 1.5%, compared with gains of 2.9% for the industry it belongs to. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 loss being widened by 64% and 43%, respectively, over the last 30 days.Teladoc’s valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at Teladoc’s price-to-book value ratio, which is one of the measures to value a company witnessing negative earnings, investors may not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-book ratio of 4.1, which is significantly above 1.9 for the industry and 3.6 for the S&P 500.Teladoc’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undermines its growth potential. The company’s negative ROE of 13.1%, though moderated in the past two years, compares unfavorably with ROE of 23.7% for the industry and 15.9% for the S&P 500, reflecting its inefficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Stocks to ConsiderAetna Inc.

These factors suggest that Aetna is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings, and that AET has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.Aetna Inc.

1048,AET,"In the Q2 earnings season, the Hospital industry, part of the Healthcare sector gave an overall weak performance with softness in patient volumes, which adversely impacted revenues. Also, increased expenses hurt the bottom line and margins. Significant regulatory uncertainty is anticipated with ongoing efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Therefore stocks in this space have lost their sheen.One such stock is LifePoint Health Inc. (LPNT  -  Free Report) that has been witnessing downward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ pessimism about its prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 moved down 2.9% and 2.8%, respectively.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost around 11.1% of its value in the last six months, in line with the industry.'s decline.Notably, LifePoint is also suffering from a number of other issues which makes it an underperformer.Why LifePoint is a SellTightening of Guidance: Following second-quarter results, the company trimmed its 2017 guidance. It now expects net revenues of $6.425 billion to $6.5 billion (versus the old estimate of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion); adjusted EBIDTA of $775 million to $795 million (previous range was $785 million to $815 million); adjusted EPS of $3.92 to $4.20 (previous guidance was $4.05 to $4.34). Equivalent admissions are expected to decline 0.5% or remain unchanged. The guidance reduction accounted for a challenging volume environment and weak revenue growth.Expenses Rising More Than Revenues: Life Point’s expenses have increased at a rate higher than the revenue growth rate from 2006-2016. The company, however, witnessed a 1.5% decline in total operating expenses in the first half of 2017.The company is experiencing an increase in professional fees and higher interest expenses due to increasing debt. It is also faced with higher depreciation and amortization as a result of an increase in spending on information systems and increase in supplies expenses due to recent acquisitions. These costs will lead to an increase in total expenses in the coming quarters.Increasing Bad Debts: To provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future, the company has established a provision for doubtful accounts. Its provision for doubtful accounts has been increasing for the past many years and the same was seen in the first half of 2017. The company has long struggled to collect unpaid bills as any increase in uncollectible bills will hit its bottom line.Overvalued: LifePoint’s valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-earnings ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 14.43, which is higher than the one-year forward P/E ratio of 13.75 for the industry.Stocks to ConsiderAetna Inc.

1049,AET,"On Aug 16, the stock of Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $180.42. The rise in the stock is believed to have been driven by better-than-expected second-quarter results and a subsequent guidance raise.Cigna’s second-quarter earnings and revenues beat estimates by 17.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The earnings beat reflected strong contribution from each of the company’s business segments.Cigna pulled up its 2017 earnings guidance after strong results. It expects adjusted income from operations between $2.50 billion and $2.58 billion (previous estimate was $2.41 billion to $2.53 billion), or $9.75 to $10.05 per share ($9.25–$9.75).It, however, maintained the guidance for revenue growth rate at 3% to 4%, and the global medical customer growth range of 0.5 million to 0.6 million.In one year, the stock has rallied 35.6%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 30% and significantly higher than the return of 12.4% from the S&P 500 index.Investors also favorably viewed Cigna’s recent purchase of Zurich Insurance Middle East, which will strengthen its foothold in the Gulf countries of UAE, Lebanon, Kuwait and Oman. The deal will bolster its already strong international business, the premium at which has witnessed a 12% CAGR to $1.9 billion in 2016 from $0.9 billion in 2009.  This deal has made the company’s investors quite optimism about its efforts to diversify operations outside U.S. markets that are faced with stiff competition and stringent regulations.Shares also received a boost from the lifting of MA sanctions (last month) by CMS. The company was restricted to sell MA plans since Jan 2016, after it was found guilty of violating regulations relating to these.Now, with the sanctions lifted, Cigna will be able to participate in an open enrollment period for 2018 plans, which will start from Nov 1, 2017. The development will add to the company’s organic growth by increasing MA membership.Shares of the company have performed strongly despite the failed merger of Cigna with Anthem Inc. Cigna’s investors have the confidence in its ability to grow as a stand-alone entity.Recently, the company projected 2021 earnings per share (EPS) of $16, and an EPS annual growth guidance of 10-13%. The 2021 EPS guidance took into consideration substantial balance sheet strength of $7 billion to $14 billion deployable cash.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1052,AET,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc.’s (WCG  -  Free Report) growth strategies continue to help it retain its leading position in the industry. It has been strengthening its revenue base consistently over the last 10 years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) implemented by the former U.S. President Barrack Obama also contributed significantly to the company’s top-line growth. Nevertheless, a lot many hassles around “Repealing and Replacing” the ACA under the Trump administration might lead to volatility in Medicaid programs enrolment.However, despite the regulatory uncertainty, WellCare Health remains an attractive pick for investors. Let’s delve deeper to find out why.WellCare Health has been witnessing consistent revenue growth supported by strategic acquisitions, partnerships and alliances since 2011. These initiatives not only bolstered the company’s presence in existing markets but also expanded its operations geographically. In the first half of 2017, revenues of $8.2 billion increased 15.6% year over year due to strong organic growth across all its three lines of business and the company's acquisition of Care1st Arizona.The company’s substantial cash inflow has helped it increase shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives. In the first half of 2017, net cash from operating activities was $335 million versus net cash used for operating activities of $60 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the advanced timing of Medicare-related receipts.  This high level of financial liquidity is expected to support the company's inorganic growth initiatives and further drive top-line growth.The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 47.37%.

1054,AET,"Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) has completed a public offering of $1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due to mature on Aug 15, 2047. The company intends to use $987.6 million in net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and to repay a portion of its 1.5% senior notes and floating-rate senior notes, both due in 2017.Prior to the completion of this issuance, these notes received rating action from A.M. Best. The rating giant assigned a Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “bbb” to these senior unsecured notes.Aetna’s financial solvency reflected substantial improvement after the early redemption of $10.2 billion of senior notes in February 2017, which were issued in 2016 to finance the then pending buyout of Humana, Inc (HUM  -  Free Report). However, following the termination of the buyout, Aetna redeemed a significant portion of that debt. As a result, the company’s financial leverage came down below 40% as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 50% at the end of 2016.Per A.M Best, the debt issuance is likely to cause a marginal increase to Aetna’s debt-to-capital ratio until the forthcoming maturities are paid back in 2017. Nevertheless, the rating giant also believes the ratio will eventually go below 40%.Aetna witnessed a decline in its shareholders’ equity on Jun 30, 2017 from year-end 2016. The fall was due to its accelerated share repurchase and dividend hike. The company’s disciplined capital management is viewed favorably by investors. In last six months, the company’s shares have gained 25%, outpacing the industry’s rally of 21%.However, Aetna’s financial results were adversely impacted by the payment of the $1 billion merger termination fee to Humana in early 2017. Despite this, we remain optimistic about Aetna’s financial excellence backed by its group commercial and government business that posted better-than-expected results in the second quarter of 2017, supported largely by premium growth and modest cost trend.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderAetna presently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors may also consider some other stocks in the same space like Anthem Inc.

After yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report that was consistent with good news we’ve mostly been experiencing of late, expectations are for roughly 180K new jobs created. The unemployment rate last read was 4.4%.Initial Jobless Claims fell 5000 to 240K last week, as the previous week had been revised up 1000. Again we see results range-bound between 225K-250K week to week, with very few outliers, over the past year or more. The 4-week moving average is currently 241,750, down 2500 week over week. Continuing claims again remained below 2 million, at 1.968 million.And the Bank of England is taking steps to brace for its coming Brexit — the separation of Great Britain from the European Union, which was voted on last year (and cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job, pretty much) to the greater world’s surprise. BOE Governor Mark Carney is quoted as having said, “the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic relationship with the EU will be tested.” As such, the Monetary Policy Committee will be keeping rates unchanged, and the BOE has lowered economic growth projections.

In spite of higher costs associated with the termination of the merger agreement with Humana Inc. (HUM), the company displayed bottom-line improvement.The company has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates on each occasion, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.62%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackAetna’ results will continue to suffer from the ongoing losses in its Individual Commercial Affordable Care Act-compliant products sold on public exchanges. Consequently, the company has scaled back its footprint on many exchanges to reduce its risk exposure to these products. In the first quarter, revenues suffered from lower membership in the ACA compliant individual and small group products and the same is expected in the to-be-reported quarter.Its commercial membership will also feel the strain as employers prefer to stay self-insured.The company’s Government business which consists of Medicare and Medicaid is has been performing well for the past many quarters. With ever-increasing demand for these products from the growing population of baby boomers, we expect to see higher sales from this business in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses. As a result of these cost-control initiatives, adjusted operating expense ratio declined in 2016 and through the first quarter of 2017. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter, providing an extra cover to margins.In the first quarter, Aetna resumed its share buyback which was terminated due to its planned merger with Humana. Share repurchases made by the company in the second quarter will help to lift its earnings.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aetna is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Aetna has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.34 per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 3. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.17% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

(FNGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report second-quarter earnings results on Aug 8.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1065,AET,"The stock market is marching higher, hitting multiple fresh highs amid Washington turmoil, geopolitical risks and lofty valuation. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems a perfect choice. These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation.Why Dividend Growth Investing Is Better?Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds –– potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market. This is because these stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum.

1066,AET,"Humana Inc.(HUM  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterHumana’s revenue base is likely to receive a boost from the strong performance of Individual Medicare Advantage, the Group Medicare Advantage and Healthcare Services businesses in the second quarter.The standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership is likely to grow, adding significantly to the Medicare business.Nevertheless, Humana is expected to suffer from rising benefit expenses, which will putpressure on margins.Continuing the trend of the past quarters, individual commercial membership is expected to remain a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016.Another weak performer, the public exchange business, might continue the trend of underperformance in the second quarter as well.The blocked merger with Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) that went through numerous regulatory procedures is likely to continue to increase legal expenses, putting pressure on the bottom line in the second quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Humana is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

1068,AET,"Healthcare stocks are back in focus as the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” scenario plays out. A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” not meeting with much success and basically collapsing.A quick look at the events that have unfolded over the past few months shows that “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” has been a key goal for President Trump who had said that his first course of action, once elected, for Obamacare would be to ask Congress to repeal it immediately. However, the President and Republican party leaders first suffered a setback in March this year with a healthcare bill (the American Healthcare Act or Trumpcare) being pulled from the House floor when it became clear that there would not be enough votes to pass the bill.Then in June, the Senate issued its version, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, with certain changes being made -- however, four Republican Senators (Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and Mike Lee) issued a joint statement saying that they were not ready to vote for the bill due to several reasons but were open to negotiation and obtaining more information before the bill was brought to the floor. While the Senators acknowledged that the draft bill was an improvement to the current health care system, they noted that it did not appear to accomplish the goal of repealing Obamacare and making health care more affordable.Last week, the Senate came out with a revised version of its bill but this too failed to garner full support with Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announcing earlier this week that they will not vote for the current version of the bill. Moreover, moderate senators were concerned by the cuts to Medicaid.Repeal Now, Replace LaterWith efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing, the focus has now shifted to repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement -- the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017. But what will the repercussions be if such a move is taken?According to a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) yesterday, enacting this legislation would cut federal deficits by $473 billion over the coming decade. However, the number of uninsured people would go up by 17 million in 2018 and average premiums in the nongroup market would increase by about 25%.Once the ACA’s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies for insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the ACA are eliminated, the number of uninsured Americans would go up by 27 million in 2020 with premiums rising about 50%. 2026 would see the uninsured go up by 32 million with premiums doubling compared to the current law. Given these numbers, it doesn’t seem likely that “Repeal Now, Replace Later” will get much support.Impact on Healthcare StocksAs the “Repeal Now, Replace Later” scenario plays out, hospital and insurance stocks will remain in the limelight. Insurance stocks have had a very strong run so far in 2017 with the Zacks-categorized Medical - Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) industry outperforming the S&P 500 with the industry climbing 22% compared to the overall market gain of 10.7%. Not surprisingly, the HMO industry is among the top 13% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hospital stocks have also had a pretty decent run so far this year though this sector will be under pressure if Obamacare gets repealed without a suitable replacement. This is because hospitals benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage. Repealing and/or replacing Obamacare without a suitable replacement would result in a significant increase in the uninsured population which does not bode well for hospitals. The Zacks-categorized Medical-Hospital industry is currently among the bottom 30% of the Zacks-ranked industries.With healthcare reform expected to remain a key topic of discussion, expect volatility and uncertainty in this corner of the healthcare market in the near-term.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1069,AET,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has witnessed a rating action from Moody's Investors Service. Moody's affirmed the senior debt rating of the UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (UHIC) unit at ‘A3’ and the insurance financial strength (IFS) rating at 'A1.’Moody’s also upgraded the outlook on UnitedHealth and UHIC to stable from negative.Looking back, Moody’s had put the company’s rating on negative watch following its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran in 2015. This raised the company’s leverage ratio as the deal was financed by debt.The rating action takes into account the company’s leadership position in the industry, its diversified business product profile, its profitable health benefits and health service segments. Consistent cash generation by UnitedHealth has enabled it to lower its debt levels.An offsetting factor is the company’s use of debt for acquisitions, which makes it more leveraged. Also, high goodwill and lower risk based capital ratio (as at the end of 2016) is another blip.Volatility in medical cost and regulatory uncertainties are the other headwinds facing the company.Nevertheless, the rating agency is of the opinion that the company will continue to post strong earnings driven by stable medical utilization trends, disciplined medical management, and efforts toward reducing debt levels to 40% from 44% as of Mar 31, 2017.In the last one year, the stock has returned 32%, a little lower than the Zacks categorized Medical - HMOs industry’s gain of 35%. However, the underperformance is not a matter of concern and we expect shares to gain traction soon, given the company’s strong fundamentals.Early during the year, two major players in the same industry — Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) — got their respective debt ratings affirmed, with a stable outlook from Moody’s, after they mutually terminated their merger.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1071,AET,"Health insurance is one of the few industries that have been able to hold up their outperformance for the past several years, irrespective of economic uncertainty and regulatory changes.With the U.S. economy on firm footing now and regulations slowly abating, the industry is on another uptrend. Rising enrollment and top-line growth, increasing contributions from complementary businesses, product modifications, improved service, demographic changes, expansion of international operations, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrades, growth of new business units, mergers and acquisitions and healthy balance sheets have all contributed to health insurers.Per a McKinsey & Co. report, the private payor market in North America is expected to grow from $583 billion in 2010 to $1,421 billion in 2025.So What Are the Industry’s Growth Catalysts?The industry has grown 33.6% in a year’s time, more than double the increase of 15.9% clocked by the S&P 500 index, during the same time frame. Interestingly, the industry has retuned more than double the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. Let’s look at the factors that would fuel future growth.Massive Opportunity in Medicaid, MedicareMedicare and Medicaid, the health plans for retirees are highly coveted by health insurers. An aging American population, with its surging population of baby boomers reaching retirement age each day, acts as a catalyst to heavy demand for these policies.While Medicaid and Medicare are primarily provided by and are under the purview of the government, pressure on public finances is prompting many governments to impose healthcare-spending cuts or seek out private payors as intermediaries to better manage spending and outcomes. Private health insurance players have indeed been quite successful in efficient management of these programs.Per a study by Health Affairs in 2016, Medicare and Medicaid accounted for nearly 60% of health care revenues reported by the five largest U.S. commercial health insurance companies: UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report). Revenues from public coverage have more than doubled since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), growing from a combined total of $92.5 billion in 2010 to $213.1 billion in 2016.  Between 2010 and 2016, Medicaid and Medicare enrollment in the five companies doubled, from 12.8 million to 25.5 million. Medicaid enrollment rose by 1 million in 2017 to nearly 55 million Americans, according to a new report from consulting firm PwC.There seems to be no stopping this business expansion. Medicaid is the third-largest domestic program in the federal budget after Social Security and Medicare, and the share managed by private insurers is rising as states shift more of their Medicaid population to managed care plans. Per a report by PwC, the share managed by private insurers is rising as states shift more of their Medicaid population to managed care plans. This should fuel growth in this business.Medicare is another excellent opportunity as the number of people eligible for Medicare is projected to surpass 70 million individuals by 2024, up from 60 million at present, with gross spending for Medicare expected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2024, up from $770 billion projected for 2018. Medicare Advantage continues to be a popular choice for approximately one-third of those enrolled in Medicare. Seniors have rewarded insurers with rapid growth in recent years and the same is expected to continue as the market continues to expand and evolve.Cross Industry Collaboration to Cause Rapid ShiftPharmacy-benefit managers teaming up with insurers is the latest in the mounting trend of health care consolidation. Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into a comprehensive healthcare provider, offering a one-stop solution for their customers. To achieve this goal, pharmacy companies and health insurers are joining forces.  The coming together of two different sections of the healthcare space testifies that business boundaries are getting blurred.Moreover, insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost, growing consumerism and high regulations. Joining other forward- or backward-integrated companies thus seems the best survival strategy that would provide companies with additional strength and a wider business spectrum.Some of the mega deals in this vein that are currently underway are Aetna’s takeover by CVS Health Corp. (CVS) for a staggering $69 billion and Cigna’s merger with Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit management company, for a whopping $67 billion.The completion of these deals will further leave the industry, which is already highly consolidated, with very few players.Services Beyond Insurance Acts a Complement In an effort to diversify their business operations, most health insurers have developed a portfolio of products and services aimed at creating a holistic and integrated approach to individual health and wellness. These products and services, which include care delivery, population health management and engagement, health financial services, health IT, benefit operations, care operations and pharmacy care services complement their core business lines — Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products — and enable enhanced service delivery and experience to their customers.One of the leading health insurers, UnitedHealth, has been proactive in developing its health services business, which accounts for nearly 20% of its 2017 total revenues. We expect this trend to continue as the traditional business becomes more competitive and burdened with regulations.Investment in TechnologyUse of cutting edge technology is a necessity in the healthcare industry to reduce inefficiency and wastage, which have caused the U.S. healthcare to be the costliest in the world. Healthcare inefficiencies in the form of improper medical record maintenance and duplication of services have been known to be third-most common factor causing deaths in the United States after cancer and heart diseases.The need therefore is to streamline operations with the latest technologies. Electronic health records, use of analytics and data management, are some of the uses of technology which have greatly helped health insurers. Going forward, technologies such as blockchain, augmented reality, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things will be the game changers.Business Opportunities Outside the U.S.More than one-half of global health care spending occurs outside the United States, and domestic health insurers serve nearly 1-2% of that market. Continued worldwide expansion, both on an organic basis and through strategic acquisitions, is a therefore a tremendous growth priority.Moreover, excessive competition and pressure on profit margins in the U.S. market has compelled the country’s health insurers to look beyond their local dominion to foreign markets for business diversification and sustained growth and profitability.Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity. They’re followed by Aetna and Humana. The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies.Recently, UnitedHealth acquired a Chilean company, Empresas Banmédica, which will enhance its footprint in South America. The international business remains unexploited and we expect players to divert attention to this area.Healthy Balance SheetCapital level across the industry is solid, which has enabled investments in strategic growth areas with mergers and acquisitions, technological investments and innovations. Also, disciplined capital management has led to share buybacks and dividend increases, thereby increasing shareholders’ returns.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Upside PotentialThis 12-company group currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #34, which places it in the top 13% of the 256 Zacks classified industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Valuation While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3.We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio, which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. How to Play Life Insurance StocksWith an estimated 85 million people representing $1 trillion in annual health care spending still not served through managed care in the United States alone, health insurers are well positioned for continued growth.

1072,AET,"Strong operating performance of health insurers for the past many years continued in the first quarter of 2018. Higher medical enrollment, surging revenues, medical cost management and an increasing share of revenues from complementary services helped results. Most of the major players raised their earnings guidance for 2018, reflecting solid operating environment down the road. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy has held the health insurance industry in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase bode well for the space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by these insurers. The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Despite being tied by a strict regulatory regime and a fast-changing industry backdrop, insurers have time and again emerged as winners. To put it into perspective, revenues and earnings of almost all dominant health insurers have shown a secular rise since 2010, when a sweeping and historical health care reform was put into effect by ex-president Obama.Ever since the enactment of the healthcare reform act, numerous changes have gone into effect, which have altered the traditional operating model of the health insurers. The ensuing changes were taken sportingly by health insurers, which then adapted themselves to the changed industry dynamics. A shift in business mix from commercial to government, the way care is delivered from fee for service to value for care, greater emphasis on medical cost management, growing consumerism and technical innovations have been the game changers. Rapid evolution is, however, continuing in the industry. Given the need of the hour, players in the industry are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of being traditional payers. The same is being effectuated by a cross-sector collaboration wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care sector such as pharmacy benefit management, ambulatory care and physician services. Some of the deals that are underway in this vein are the merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) take over od Express Script Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report) as well as the UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) acquisition of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). All said, the industry has remained an outperformer having generated returns higher than the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. In the past five years, the health insurance industry has returned a whopping 257% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 91%. Is Further Upside Potential Left? While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3. We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). We rank 256 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We club our industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

1074,AET,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) came up with adjusted earnings per share of $4.11 in first-quarter 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.37. Also, earnings grew 48% year over year. Better-than-expected earnings were primarily driven by revenue growth.Cigna posted revenues of $11.4 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11 billion.  Revenues grew 9% year over year, led by strong business growth in Cigna's Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits segments.Premiums were up 10.4% year over year to $9 billion, while fees increased 8.4% to $1.35 billion.The company’s medical enrollment grew by 327,000 lives to 16.2 million customers driven by growth in Select, Individual and Middle Market segments.Total benefits and expenses of $10.16 billion increased 6% year over year, led by higher global health care medical cost and operating expenses.Strong Segment PerformanceGlobal Health Care: Operating revenues of $9.09 billion were up 9.7% year over year led by continued strong performance of the company’s Commercial Employer business in its targeted markets.Adjusted operating earnings were $871 million, up 42.8% year over year due to strong medical cost performance, a lower tax rate and favorable prior year reserve development.Global Supplemental Benefits: Operating revenues of $1.10 billion were up 21% year over year, reflecting continued business growth and favorable foreign currency effect.Adjusted operating income increased 51.4% year over year to $112 million, reflecting business growth and gains from expense management.Global Disability and Life: Operating revenues of $1.12 billion were down 0.4% year over year as premium growth from disability and other was offset by lower premium in Life business.Adjusted operating income declined 1.5% year over year to $67 million, due to an increase in life insurance claims.Financial PositionCigna’s cash and marketable investments were of $2.77 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $2.97 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Long-term debt was $5.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, almost unchanged from the Dec 31, 2017 level.2018 Guidance RaisedFor 2018, the company expects to earn in the range of $12.85 and $13.25, up from the previous outlook range of $12.40 and $12.90, on a per share basis.

1076,AET,"Humana Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled to be reported on May 2 (before market open), is expected to see an increase in individual Medicare Advantage membership growth. This should be driven by better retention and strong sales during the recently completed Annual Election Period, or AEP. Market share gains in most states, with some of the company’s largest gains in Florida, Texas, Arizona and Illinois, would lead to MA business growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Individual Medicare Avdantage membership should be 3 million, up 7.1% year over year.This MA membership growth should drive the company’s Retail segment revenues, which are expected to be $12.2 billion, up 7%, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, investments made in this segment for long-term sustainability will lower its pre-tax margin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income before taxes is $282 million, down 23.8% year over year.The productivity initiatives undertaken in 2017 are expected to result in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental savings for 2018, a portion of which will be classified as a reduction in medical costs versus operating costs. We expect to see the favorable affect of this on first quarter margins.  Humana’s pre-tax income from Healthcare Service is expected to be down in the first quarter. This will be due to three factors. First, impact from the optimization of chronic care management programs that took place throughout 2017, and second the company’s provider services business will experience lower pre-tax due to lower Medicare rates year over year in geographies where the company’s provider assets are primarily located as well as the cost of the organic build-out of its primary care assets in certain markets. Finally, this segment will bear some of the costs of the incremental investments made by the company as a result of tax reform. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, pre-tax income from this segment is $232 million, down 4.9% year over year.Share repurchases made by the company should provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.  Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.96%. This is depicted in the chart below:Humana Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Humana Inc.

1077,AET,"Teladoc Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after the closing bell. Its quarterly revenues are expected to improve year over year.We expect Teladoc’s first-quarter earnings to see earnings upside from the recent flu season (which started from October-November and lasted through March) and is touted to be the most severe epidemic in a decade. This severe flu season must have driven healthcare utilization,which should increasetotal visits at the company. In fact, the company expects the flu season to lift its first-quarter visits by 10%.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company does not have an attractive earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. This is depicted in the chart below:Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Teladoc, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Teladoc beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Teladoc is +3.63%.Zacks Rank: Teladoc has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Affect Q1 ResultsThe company’s Telehealth services are gaining rapid acceptance due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness and superior quality, which are driving demand. Consequently, the company witnessed increased patient visits in the first quarter. Also, the acquisition of HealthiestYou and Best Doctors have driven visits and call volumes and the trend must have continued in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for patient visits is 555,950, reflecting an improvement of 44.5% year over year.A major component of the company’s revenues is subscription access fees, which account for 80-85% of revenues. We expect a surge in this revenue component driven by the number of clients and services used.The company’s efforts on consistently gaining clients by virtue of its superior service, a wide network of doctors and round-the-clock medical assistance, cross-selling multiple services to clients should give a boost to subscription service. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the same was up 115% year over year.The company expects adjusted EBITDA to dip to negative in the first quarter due to costs of onboarding new members and the activation of several of the company’s material new contracts.Company’s Guidance for Q1For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects total revenues between $86 million and $88 million, an EBITDA loss between $12 million and $13 million, an adjusted EBITDA loss between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, total U.S. paid membership of approximately 19.5 million to 20 million members and total visits between 575,000 and 625,000 visits. Net loss per share based on 61.9 million weighted average shares outstanding is expected to range from a loss of 43 cents to a loss of 45 cents.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

1078,AET,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark and has showcased strong results with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach the highest level in seven years.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 73.8% outperforming on the top line.The Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) is expected to deliver 12.9% earnings growth on 7% higher revenues in the first quarter. This is, however, shy of the projected 22.6% and 8.4% revenue and earnings growth, respectively, for the S&P 500 index.Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector, which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations (HMOs) popularly known as health insurers, clinical, laboratories and diagnostics research, medical equipment, hospitals & nursing homes, telehealth services and more. The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing one industry positively can be a negative for another. For example flu, which causes an increase in medical services utilization, is an earnings driver for the hospital space, while a negative for insurers as it causes a spike in claims cost.To put it into perspective, the January-March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season, which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers. But because of UnitedHealth’s superior medical cost management, the flu season did not have any adverse impact on the company’s results. UnitedHealth is considered a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu, the first quarter will be profitable.Health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrollment from the government businesses – Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies. Earnings should also see an upside from ancillary and health service businesses, which health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify revenue base. These businesses which focus on data management, management of clinical records, analytics, clinical care, pharmacy care and more have been a nice contributor to the group’s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue.However, this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain, as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales. Companies in the hospital sector should see increased patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help, which in turn should drive their top-line growth.Nevertheless, the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat, from walk-in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for past many quarters.Let’s find out where the following healthcare stocks stand ahead of their first-quarter releases on May 1.Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report)  is expected to gain from the projected increase in net income and adjusted earnings resulting from lower taxes, strong growth in individual Medicare Advantage products and group Medicare Advantage products, as well as lesser losses from the exiting Individual Commercial products in 2018.A decline in tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and reduced losses from the individual exchange business will aid margins.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects 10% year-over-year growth. Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its Earnings ESP of +0.43%, makes us confident of a positive earnings surprise. (Read more:  Will Higher Medicare Revenues Aid Aetna Q1 Earnings?)The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.5%. This is depicted in the chart below:Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteHCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) should see higher flu-related volumes combined with the anticipated benefits from the income tax reform and an earnings upside from favorable exchange rates.However, the company’s first-quarter results are expected to suffer from industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and the prevalence of high deductible health plans, and an increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects 19% year-over-year growth.

1079,AET,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell.The company is expected to gain from the projected increase in net income and adjusted earnings resulting from lower taxes, strong growth in individual Medicare Advantage products and group Medicare Advantage products, as well as lesser losses from the exiting Individual Commercial products in 2018.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.5%. This is depicted in the chart below:Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Aetna beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Aetna is +0.43%.Zacks Rank: Aetna has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsHigher Membership in Government Business: We expect higher membership in this business given the company's expansion focus. The Medicare business performed exceptionally well in the past several quarters and the trend is expected to continue in the to-be reported quarter, led by its strong star ratings, attractive product designs and increasing geographic presence. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, membership in the company's Medicare Advantage business should be 1.66 million, up 15.2% year over year. The same for Medicare Supplement should be 774,000, up 8.9% year over year.Tax Reform Upside: As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was effective in December 2017, Aetna projects its corporate income tax rate to decline. Aetna estimates that the tax reform will increase gross 2018 adjusted earnings by approximately $800 million, of which at least 50% will accrue to adjusted earnings. Thus the tax reform should benefit the company’s margins in the first quarter.Reduced Loss From Pubic Exchange Business:  Aetna has been suffering losses on its public exchanges business for the past two years. Lackluster results have forced the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017. The company has significantly reduced its exposure to Individual Commercial products for 2018. The curtailment of this business will help in reduction of losses.Lower Revenues:  Aetna's revenues are expected to remain under pressure in 2018 owing to the sale of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management business lines; the previously disclosed Medicaid contract termination; exits from Individual Commercial products and continued repositioning of its ACA compliant small group Commercial products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $15.3 billion, down 1.13% year over year.Zacks Rank and Other StocksHere are some other companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

1080,AET,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Aetna is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AET in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.99 per share for AET, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AET, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.43% heading into earnings season.Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AET has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

1081,AET,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30 after market close.Tenet Healthcare’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect the industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers, are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter. These might in turn result in lower admissions inducing a decline in patient revenues.However, an unusual flu season in the first quarter must have led to a surge in patient admissions as more patients seek treatment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues are pegged at $2.5 billion and $1.4 billion, reflecting 5.2% and 7.6% decline, respectively, over the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for - adjusted patient admissions in the quarter to be reported is pegged at 0.3 million, down 5.5% year over year.Other FactorsTenet Healthcare’s Ambulatory segment has been performing well over the past many quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues stands at $486 million for the first quarter, reflecting 7% rise year over year. We expect the same to further benefit from this solid segmental performance.The company’s cost management program primarily comprised headcount reductions and the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors. Its enterprise-wide cost-reduction initiatives are likely to decrease expenses and favor margins.Further, the company’s share buybacks during the first quarter are expected to aid its bottom line.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Tenet Healthcare has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Tenet Healthcare has an Earnings ESPof +121.43%.

1082,AET,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.20%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Anthem’s revenues have been consistently growing over the past several quarters, driven membership growth. The company’s fully insured and self-funded memberships have boosted the total enrollment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $22.5 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of nearly 1%.The company’s Government business has been performing well over  a considerable period of time, supported by increasing Medicaid and Medicare enrollment. The consensus mark for total operating revenues of Government business is pegged at $12.8 billion, up 7% year over year.However, higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products and more claims leading to an escalated benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business are expected to drain the bottom line.Additionally, continuing with the earlier trend, Anthem is anticipated to have witnessed higher administrative costs in the first quarter.Anthem’s results are also likely to be affected by a persistent softness in its Individual business.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Anthem is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Anthem has an Earnings ESP of -1.83%.

1084,AET,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Orlando, FL-based Family Physicians Group (“FPG”). Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.Humana’s Medicare ExpansionAmid speculations that Humana might be acquired by retail major Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), the deal is an indication that Humana is not giving up on its strategy of expanding its provider networks.Humana’s Medicare Advantage business has been strongly delivering owing to operating initiatives that have led to favorable prior-period medical claims development and lower current-year utilization, evident from average 5.5% growth of total Retail Medicare membership in the last four years. Earlier, the company acquired MD Care, which increased Humana’s Medicare Advantage membership strength by approximately 15,000 members.Shareholders have also gained confidence in the stock, given its strong Medicare membership base and growth potential. In a year’s time, the stock has surged 34.8%, outperforming the industry’s rise of 33.8%. Why FPG?FPG is known to be one of the largest at-risk providers serving Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid HMO patients in Greater Orlando. The company serves more than 22,000 Medicare Advantage patients including nearly 4,000 Humana members. The company’s expertise in treating people of Central Florida, especially seniors with chronic conditions, is expected to further fortify Humana’s commitment to helping its Medicare, Medicaid plus government and commercial members achieve their best health.Humana’s value-based care model revolves around physicians’ utmost efforts to achieve improved health outcomes for patients, lowering medical expenses and transforming health care nationally. The company is aggressively widening its primary care model with intention to establish a national footprint of senior, high-performing, focused primary care physicians.Moreover, FPG’s comprehensive care management model and proactive medical management initiatives successfully improve patient outcomes at a lower cost. The buyout of FPG significantly supports Humana’s strategy to help physicians and clinicians manage members’ health via a holistic approach.Peers’ Moves in the Medicare SpaceThe lucrative nature of Medicare business along with its leading players’ objective to stake a claim in this rapidly growing health insurance market has fueled a series of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.Cigna Corporation's (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are noteworthy in this respect.The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on account of raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% is likely to further boost the potential of Medicare space driving more consolidations.Zacks RankHumana carries a Zacks rank #3 (Hold).

1085,AET,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe picked up rapidly in the first quarter thanks to U.S. tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe.Per the preliminary Thomson Reuters data, global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start ever totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2018. This is up 67% over the past year and marks the fourth quarter that has surpassed $1 trillion over the past three years. United States M&A volumes climbed 67% while Europe volumes doubled. Meanwhile, Asia saw an 11% increase. However, the number of deals dropped 10% year over year to 10,338.According to a report by research firm Mergermarket, M&A activity across the world has hit a 17-year-high record in the first quarter with 3,774 deals globally, totaling $890.7 billion. This was the strongest start to the year since 2001 and represents an 18% year-over-year increase in value.The healthcare space has so far been at the forefront as Amazon’s move into the pharmaceutical sphere has spurred the major pharmacy retailers to consolidate. With regard to this, U.S. health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) will acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. In another deal, the drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) is also in a process of acquiring the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Another large agreement is German utility EON SE’s $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG’s renewable energy business Innogy SE.The boom in M&A is likely to continue given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allows companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 44 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Blue Buffalo Pet Products  and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) on the long side. These two firms combined to make up for 17.5% share. The product has amassed $503.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 119,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 2.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 33 stocks. Technology, industrials, healthcare and financials are the top three sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.4 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market (read: Trade Tensions or Not, Stay Safe with These ETFs). This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1086,AET,"The health insurers continue to gain traction from increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost-control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position. All these led to both top and bottom-line growth for most players in the field. Many in the industry have also kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, thus indicating their rising operational excellence.Banking on the above positives, the industry has gained nearly 35.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 11.3%. The Zacks HMO industry is placed among the top 21% of the Zacks Ranked industries. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.Government Plans Look LucrativeDespite the prevalent uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry continues to put up a good show in 2018.  We see sustainable growth potential in expanding government programs. The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% also proves that. This action will definitely attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing their managed care participation. Since the government plans have already been highly profitable for health insurers, their increased participation is likely to result in significant top and bottom line growth.Apart from this upside, an increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Thriving Economy, Rising Interest Rates, Changing Demography Fuel GrowthGrowing demand for health insurance products and services on the back of changing demographics, increasing income, low unemployment and jobless claims continue to aid the insurance stocks. A strong economy enables people to spend more on their healthcare needs that again opens up scope for the health insurers. An ageing U.S. population also boosts demand for Medicare Advantage plans, especially designed for the retirees to control the rising Medicare costs. This in turn encourages more participation from health insurers ensuring profitability on this ground.Additionally, the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve also bodes well for health insurers. The managed care companies benefit from the rising rates owing to a generally sizeable investment securities portfolio coupled with manageable debt levels.Consolidation in the IndustryOf late, increasing consolidation has been a major phenomenon in the health insurance industry. This in turn leads to market concentration, which should help players enhance their operational scale as well as gain a substantial market share.Health insurers are trying to integrate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. The recently announced acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) underline the growing trend of two healthcare sector industries coming together to amicably provide a comprehensive care.Retailers have also expressed their interest in the health insurance industry. Humana has been in talks to get acquired by Walmart Inc. Eyeing the rewarding Medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population, the retail major intends to invest big time in the health insurance industry. Recently, Amazon has also entered into a joint venture with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to manage insurance for their employees and is further looking for a CEO to helm its healthcare joint venture.Stocks to Bet on Before Q2We zeroed in on three stocks, poised for an earnings beat in the second quarter of 2018.

1087,AET,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has decided to raise 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4%. Notably, CMS previously proposed a hike of 1.84% in February but this rate increase is higher than expected.Following the announcement, shares of companies with exposure to the MA business like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) rallied.Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans were initiated by the government some years ago to control the rising cost of Medicare, a government program for the retirees. Notably, this MA plans were administered by private insurance companies. The health insurers often add extra benefits to make these plans more appealing to consumers, thus justifying its name — Medicare Advantage. The government reimburses a certain amount per enrolee to the health insurers in return of the care provided.Why Is Government Pitching for High Reimbursement Rates?MA reimbursement rates for private plan increased by 0.45%, 0.85% for 2018, and, 2017, respectively. The higher-than-expected increase in reimbursement rate for 2019 is meant  to attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing managed care participation. This move will alleviate government healthcare which is reeling under high Medicare costs.According to CBO, total Medicare spending is expected to increase from $708 billion to $1.4 trillion from 2017 to 2027.  Medicare spending is anticipated to rise more rapidly relative to GDP owing to a number of factors, including the aging population and faster growth in health care costs compared with growth in the economy on a per capita basis. In an effort to decrease the government’s burden of rising healthcare costs, it intends to rope in health insurers who are effective in managing costs.In fact, the government has actually witnessed cost reduction by delegating Medicare to the private players and is encouraging customers to opt for Medicare Advantage. The recent higher-than-expected rate highlights the government’s efforts to stabilize these plans and provide enough resources to the insurance companies to support beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicare plans.A Cash Cow for Health InsurersMeanwhile, these plans have been highly profitable for the health insurers. Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates, they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members. This trend has aided top-line growth of the companies engaged in MA. Further, the health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations. This business has proven to be boon for the health insurance industry.In a year’s time the industry has gained 33.7% compared with the S&P 500 growth of 11.9%.MA — the Catalyst Behind Mergers and Acquisitions in the IndustryThe lucrative nature of this business along with the players’ intention to stake a claim in this rapidly growing market has fueled a number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.According to KPMG, MA has only been around since 2003 but it is rapidly gaining popularity as a health plan and also among seniors dissatisfied with traditional Medicare. MA plans are in great demand amid the baby boomers, a rapidly growing generation, presenting an immense business opportunity.  KPMG projects the baby boomers population to be nearly 72 million by 2030 and almost 87 million by 2050. Per Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux, 11,000 baby boomers age into Medicare eligible population ever single day.Analysis from Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, projects annual revenues for MA plans to rise from US$215 billion in fiscal year 2017 to more than $500 billion by 2025.The most recent merger speculation doing rounds is that of Walmart’s intention to buy Humana (which has nearly two thirds of its revenues coming from MA). Notably, this buyout also hinges around the coveted MA business. Its crystal clear that Walmart is planning to cash in on the MA business via Humana, an established player in this field.Recently Anthem stated that it is working to capture its fair share of the MA market.Other big acquisitions in this arena in  were UnitedHealth Group’s buyout of XLHealth Corporation, Preferred Care Partners and Medica HealthCare Plans. Further, Cigna's acquisition of HealthSpring, Humana’s takeover  of MD Care and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are also noteworthy.  In the same vein, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. acquired Universal American Corp. last year and is still on hunt for MA opportunities.Bottom LineGiven that MA is one of the few areas which has a bipartisan support, its future remains bright. Industry analysts believe that the recent increase in reimbursement rates will lead to strong enrollment growth in this business in next five years.Also the players thirst for MA business still remains unquenched; consequently we expect more mergers and acquisitions on this front.Among the companies discussed above UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Anthem, Humana and Aetna all carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

1088,AET,"Investors in Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the April 6, 2018 $125 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Aetna shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Aetna is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - HMOs industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.95 per share to $3.01 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Aetna right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1089,AET,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), following the completion of transferring stores to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report),  revealed that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired on Mar 28, 2018, satisfying one of the conditions for its merger with Albertsons Companies, Inc.Though Rite Aid shares did not react much to this announcement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 20.4% in the last three months. This marks an underperformance from the industry’s fall of 12%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rite Aid had agreed to merge with the country’s largest grocer, Albertsons Companies, in February 2018. The merger will not only help revive the distressed Rite Aid’s business but also aid in dispelling the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave Rite Aid shareholders with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own a 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.The new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics, across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger is also approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders, and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.The drugstore industry in general has been witnessing increased consolidation lately. After the failed merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the industry has seen CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) enter a deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018.  Additionally, Walgreens has bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1090,AET,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has clearly emerged as the biggest contender, when it comes to taking new initiatives to strengthen its foothold against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). From speedy deliveries to payment systems, from selling grocery to offering meal-kits online, both players have been in a raging competition for quite some time.Taking it further, Walmart’s plans to extend ties with Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) to enhance healthcare offerings, seems another bullet shot by the former in its war against the e-commerce king. Sources recently revealed that Walmart is in talks to enhance relation with Humana, which offers health insurance plans and other benefits for Medicare, individual or group insurance.  While both Walmart and Humana have remained silent over the issue, reports suggest that the deal between two giants could also be a merger or acquisition — where Walmart would scoop up the healthcare biggie. If the buyout of Humana (which currently has a market cap of about $37.1 billion) materializes, it will serve as Walmart’s biggest acquisition till date.Amazon Threat Responsible for This Move?Well, a move like this had to surface, given Amazon having its eyes on the healthcare space. Incidentally, there has been too much buzz about this e-commerce giant planning to foray the healthcare industry, especially since it announced plans to curtail health expenses and enhance care to U.S. workers, by teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan. In another move, Amazon was also looking for ways to enter the pharmacy space, evident from its plans to hire workers to figure out a strategy for the same.  Apart from the supposed Walmart-Humana deal, there have been many other transactions in the healthcare space, largely stemming from fears instilled by Amazon that shook the grocery industry with its major buyout of Whole Foods Market last year. CVS Health’s potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp's plans to buy Express Scripts and Rite Aid’s (RAD  -  Free Report) merger with Albertson's are some examples in this regard.   What the Walmart-Humana Deal Could Lead toComing back to Walmart, the supermarket giant has been expanding in healthcare for a while now. The company operates pharmacies in most of its stores and Sam Club locations, while it also has in-store clinics in Georgia, South Carolina and Texas – per media sources. Humana, on the other hand also has its own pharmacy benefits division, apart from about 200 standalone clinics for its Medicare members.While both the companies already share a Medicare drug plan aimed at lowering consumers’ drug costs, an extended alliance or buyout of Humana is likely to help Walmart emerge stronger in the field of providing primary care. Enhanced connections with Humana is likely to help Walmart leverage Humana’s patients and steer them to its stores. Further, combining retail and healthcare arms would help the companies undertake greater wellness endeavors and health plans for customers, like offering incentives for healthy food options.To this end, Walmart has already been working with Humana’s wellness rewards plan for more than four years now, which offers discounts on healthy food choices to customers who take an online health valuation. Such efforts not only help Walmart increase sale of its products like “Great For You” and “Go360”, but it also helps the retailer promote healthier lifestyle and reduce health care expenses.That said, we believe that the aforementioned Walmart-Humana merger or buyout (if materialized) is likely to be a win-win for both entities, especially for Walmart by strengthening its customer base and augmenting top line. This, in turn will solidify the big-box retailer’s position in the Amazonian retail world. Notably, Walmart’s continued efforts to battle Amazon’s growing dominance has helped its shares rally 26.8% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 21.2%. We believe that with strength across both stores and e-commerce, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is likely to witness further growth.

1091,AET,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Aetna has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Aetna’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 14.5) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Aetna has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Aetna’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Aetna has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Aetna currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AET a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 13.9, which is marginally better than the industry average of 14.1. Clearly, AET is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Aetna might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B. This gives AET a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 2.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased nearly 5.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Aetna Inc. Price and Consensus  Aetna Inc. Price and Consensus | Aetna Inc. QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Aetna is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineAetna is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a good industry rank (top 38% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>
