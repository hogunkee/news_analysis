0,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) must find ways to reduce the Pentagon's current $1.1 trillion estimate to own and operate the F-35 jet, the world's costliest weapons program, according to the Defense Department's latest annual program overview.XAccording to the document obtained by Bloomberg News, Lockheed ""must embrace much-needed supply chain management affordability initiatives"" to cut costs on the next-generation stealth fighter.The $1.1 trillion estimate to sustain the U.S. F-35 fleet through 2077 was compiled in 2015 by the Pentagon's independent cost assessment office but has not been updated, according to the Selected Acquisition Report, or SAR, obtained by Bloomberg News. The Pentagon said this week that the estimate will be updated next year before acquisition officials meet to decide whether the program should enter full-production.Although the estimate is unchanged, the acquisition report focused at length on the importance of reducing the $1.1 trillion figure as well comments from the F-35 program office pointing out what it said are shortcomings of the independent estimate.The report acknowledges that under current forecasts, ""the projected F-35 sustainment outlays are too costly"" and ""given planned fleet growth, future U.S. service operations and support budgets will be strained.""

1,LMT,"It was Jan. 17, 1991. America was at war in Iraq. The mission: Operation Desert Storm. Lockheed's F-117 Nighthawk, the first stealth fighter, showcased America's superior air power to Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world.The unconventionally shaped stealth plane would make 1,300 sorties, hitting 1,600 high-value targets during the campaign. It accounted for 40% of all targeted damage, without a single hit by enemy fire.Stealth played a key role in the military's second offset strategy, where a small number of high-tech platforms could beat the massive military hardware the Soviets boasted. Stealth marked a new era in air warfare and is a foundation of U.S. air supremacy to this day.But the game-changing F-117 wouldn't have been possible without Ben Rich, the second director of Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works, who took a major risk despite the discouragement of some of the brightest minds in aerospace.Rich was born on June 18, 1925, in Manila, Philippines, to a British hardwood lumber mill superintendent and a French linguist.As tensions rose in the Pacific, his family moved to Los Angeles just months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. There he went to work with his father in a machine shop to help support the family during the war years. His shelved his dream to go to college to become a doctor.At 21 Rich was finally able to attend college. He graduated in 1949 with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He later received a master's degree in aerothermodynamics from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he met his first wife, Faye.The postwar recession made jobs scarce. But Rich managed to find an engineering job at Lockheed (LMT) in 1950. Because he wasn't earning enough to support his growing family, he gave notice after just four years of employment. He was all set to take over his father-in-law's bakery-delicatessen. At the last second, Rich changed his mind. Truth was, he liked building airplanes better than selling deli meats.Soon after deciding to stay at Lockheed, he joined Skunk Works at the request of founder Kelly Johnson.Skunk Works, formally called the Advanced Development Programs, is Lockheed's legendary research and development lab. Created in 1943 to develop the company's top-secret technology during World War II, it was the birthplace of the P-38 fighter. Employees at the secretive unit refer to themselves as ""Skunks.""The division started in a circus tent outside the main Lockheed building in Burbank, next to a smelly plastics factory. Their unique moniker comes from a stinky concoction make by a bootlegger in the ""Li'l Abner"" comic strip.Under Johnson, Rich worked on the highflying U-2 spy plane, which the Air Force plans to keep flying for more than 100 years.He also designed the air-inlet control system for the SR-71 Blackbird, which can fly three times the speed of sound. In his autobiography, ""Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed,"" Rich called his contribution to the SR-71 the most ""exhausting, difficult and nerve-wracking work"" of his career.Rich won the American Institution of Aeronautics and Astronautics Award in 1972 for the Blackbird's propulsion system. His work on the F-117 would win Rich aerospace's top award, the prestigious Collier Trophy, in 1989. Kelly Johnson tapped Rich as his replacement in 1975. Rich was a popular choice. Most of the Skunks chose to stay during the major transition.""Tip your hat to someone like Ben keeping an operation going after such a strong leader like Kelly,"" said Larry Pellett, the current director of major projects at Skunk Works. Rich asked Pellett to join Skunk Works after seeing him give a presentation in 1989.Johnson was an autocratic leader. He was very hands-on with his technical workers. He reworked submitted designs, striking fear into some of the younger employees. But Pellett said Rich's success resided in the fact that he never tried to be like Johnson. Instead he adopted his own managerial style.""There is a joke among Skunks that Kelly managed with his bad temper, and Ben managed with bad jokes,"" Pellett said. ""He was the cheerleader, the facilitator that built the team up.""Other employees felt the same way about Rich's brand of leadership.""Ben kept a close eye on all our problems, but he was never a second-guesser,"" Alan Brown, Rich's program manager, said in Rich's autobiography. ""Rich let us do our thing and smooth our way with the Air Force and Lockheed management.""Rich took the reins during a tumultuous time for Lockheed. Spending on the unpopular Vietnam War was winding down. And the company found itself in the midst of a bribery scandal.To add to the company's woes, Lockheed hadn't won a fighter contract since the F-104 Starfighter, built during the Korean War. But a major breakthrough was on the horizon.The aviation community considers Rich the father of stealth. But the idea came from an unlikely source. Pyotr Ufimtsev, a Soviet scientist, theorized about stealth technology in a 1962 paper called ""Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction."" The paper outlined equations on how to calculate radar cross-sections, an object's ability to reflect radar. But the Soviets deemed the paper impractical and of little use. Ufimstev's discovery would have stayed buried in a Soviet library, if not for Rich.Denys Overholser, a radar specialist, brought the research paper to Rich just six months after Rich took the helm at the Skunk Works. Overholser suggested the company use the equations to build their own stealth plane that could evade the Soviet Union's radar.""I take credit for immediately recognizing the value of the gift I was handed before it became apparent to everyone else, and for taking major risks in expanding development costs before we had any real government interest or commitment,"" Rich said in his autobiography.The result was a model made from a series of flat surfaces that looked like a cut diamond. It was nicknamed ""Rich's Folly"" and ""Hopeless Diamond,"" among other things. The oddly shaped plane is now sometimes compared to a flying Darth Vader.Despite having a working model, Lockheed hadn't been invited to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) competition to build a stealthy plane. All development contract money had been awarded by the time Rich heard of the contest.Rich convinced DARPA head George Heilmeier to let Lockheed join the competition. Rich also smartly rejected DARPA's pro forma $1 offer. Instead he submitted his proposal for free, ensuring the technology would remain the property of Lockheed.Never straying too far from Skunk Works, Johnson caught wind of the stealth plane. He furiously told Rich to shut down development. Johnson erroneously believed missiles were the future of warfare. The ugly, flat-paneled airplane would never fly, he thought.Larry Kitchen, Lockheed's president at the time, was also a skeptic. He said the company needed ""real projects, not pipe dreams,"" Rich recalled in his autobiography.But Rich persevered despite the naysayers. He believed in the game-changing technology. Rich spent nearly 1 million dollars of Skunk Works' development cash on the stealth project. He envisioned huge military and financial returns in the future.""I never wavered from believing that stealth could create the biggest Skunk Works bonanza ever,"" Rich wrote.Despite being shut out of the DARPA competition at first, ""Rich's Folly"" eventually beat Northrop's submission. After two successful experimental prototypes, built quickly from off-the-shelf items at Skunk Works, the F-117 program was born.But while Rich was about to make a major military breakthrough, he suffered a major personal loss. His wife Faye passed away in 1980. Rich pressed on in his work to manage his grief.The F-117 first flew in 1981 and entered service in 1983. Kept in the dark, the plane wouldn't see its first mission until 1989 in Panama. It wouldn't become an international sensation until the Gulf War. And as the first F-117s took to the skies over Iraq in 1991, Rich and his Skunks celebrated his retirement.Rich had some setbacks during his time at the Skunk Works. Lockheed lost out on the B-2 bomber contract to Northrop (NOC) because he refused to overpromise on price and capabilities. The B-2 would become a casualty of a ""death spiral,"" where decreased military spending by Washington led to less planes being purchased, leading to a higher cost per plane. The B-2 would eventually go on to cost billions of dollars more than first budgeted as Congress kept cutting the number of planes ordered.""I never lied to a customer or tried to dodge the heat when we screwed up,"" he wrote. ""I knew how other companies operated, and I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures. And I was right.""Rich died of cancer on Jan. 5, 1995, but his legacy lives on at Skunk Works. Stealth brought Lockheed back into the fighter jet business. The company built the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. The latter accounts for a quarter of Lockheed Martin's yearly revenue.Following Rich's belief in the need to find the next revolutionary advancement, Skunk Works is developing the next disruptive technologies, from hypersonics to artificial intelligence, in an effort to stay ahead of growing advances by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China.Engineer who believed stealth technology would be a game-changer on the battlefieldOvercame: Skepticism and the shadow of his revered mentor.Lesson: Recognized the power of a new technology and stuck to his project despite doubts from respected members in his field.""I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

2,LMT,"The U.S. Air Force may have to cut its purchases of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 by a third if it can't find ways to reduce operations and support costs by as much as 38% over a decade, according to an internal analysis.XThe shortfall would force the service to subtract 590 of the fighter jets from the 1,763 it plans to order, the Air Force office charged with evaluating the F-35's impact on operations and budgets, in an assessment obtained by Bloomberg News.While the Defense Department has said it has gained control over costs for developing and producing a fleet of 2,456 F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps -- now projected at $406 billion -- the internal analysis underscores the current and looming challenges of maintaining and operating the warplanes.It may cost as much as $1.1 trillion to keep the F-35s flying and maintained through 2070, according to the current estimate from the Pentagon's independent cost unit.A chart in the Air Force analysis, which was completed in December, said the service has ""very limited visibility into how"" increasing funds going to Lockheed for ""contractor support"" are spent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe analysis represents the first public disclosure of the potential impact if support costs aren't reduced. Using figures developed in 2012, the Air Force faces an annual bill of about $3.8 billion a year that must be cut back over the coming decade.The Air Force analysis doesn't represent anything close to a final decision, according to spokeswoman Ann Stefanik. The potential reduction in aircraft was a ""staff assessment on aircraft affordability. It's premature for the Air Force to consider buying fewer aircraft at this time,"" Stefanik said.The Air Force is working with the Pentagon's F-35 program office to reach the 38 percent reduction in operation and support costs through 2028 from the $38 billion calculated in 2012, she added.The long-term support concerns are on top of current F-35 challenges including parts shortages, unavailable aircraft and technical issues that must be resolved as the program ends its 17-year development phase. In September, the F-35 is to begin as much as a year of rigorous combat testing that's required by law. Successful testing would trigger full-rate production, the most profitable phase for Lockheed, as soon as late 2019.The F-35 program is accelerating: Congress bankrolled 90 jets, or 20 more than requested, in the spending bill for the current fiscal year.Half of the operations and support expenditures are tied to Lockheed's costs and include ""program management, depot maintenance, part repair, software maintenance, engineering,"" Stefanik said. Those costs ""are growing with the increase in flight hours. The Air Force is working to gather visibility into cost data to better understand the rationale for the growth,"" she said.The remaining costs are managed by the Air Force, including military personnel and fuel, she said. Upkeep costs for the F-35 are also a challenge for allies buying the plane, including the U.K., Australia and Italy.Stephen Lovegrove, the U.K.'s No. 2 civilian defense official, told reporters Tuesday at a Defense Writers Group breakfast in Washington that although the F-35 ""is doing everything we hoped it would do,"" his country also is grappling with the size and scope of the future support costs for a ""very, very complicated platform.""Lovegrove, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Defence, said he'd be discussing the ""slightly unknown territory"" of long-term costs in meetings with F-35 program officials. The U.K. is buying 138 of the Marine Corps version of the F-35 designed to be flown off aircraft carriers.The U.S. Government Accountability Office said in an October report that ""there is little doubt"" the F-35 ""brings unique capabilities to the American military, but without revising sustainment plans"" the military ""is at risk of being unable to leverage the capabilities of the aircraft it has recently purchased.""It's a sentiment shared by Undersecretary Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, who told reporters in January that ""right now, we can't afford the sustainment costs we have on the F-35. And we're committed to changing that.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

3,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) have received multibillion-dollar radar contracts as the Pentagon continues to bulk up its missile defense despite President Trump's claim the North Korea threat is over.XThe defense giants were each awarded deals worth up to $4.1 billion to ""provide autonomous acquisition and persistent precision tracking and discrimination to optimize the defensive capability of the Ballistic Missile Defense system,"" the Defense Department said late Tuesday.The companies will compete against each other until the Pentagon narrows the award down to a single contractor's radar.While it's not explicitly stated, the contract is for a replacement to Raytheon's massive Sea-Based X-Band Radar, which floats on a nine-story oil rig platform designed by Boeing (BA).The X-Band Radar ""is getting old and costly to operate. So they are moving to a ground-based solution there,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow and missile defense analyst at CSIS.The new radar will be deployed in Hawaii and have a 180-degree field of view toward North Korea, he said. He added that there might be a second radar planned for somewhere in the Pacific.Raytheon shares closed down 1% on the stock market today.

Trump later tweeted there ""is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""However, satellite images have since shown North Korea upgrading the plutonium production reactor and support buildings at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center.While all the defense contractors picked have extensive missile defense experience, Lockheed has scored some key radar contracts recently.Lockheed is currently building the Long Range Discrimination Radar in Alaska. But Karako said the radar is too far north to see missiles headed to Hawaii from North Korea.Lockheed is also reportedly building its long-range radar for two of Japan's planned Aegis Ashore missile defense systems.Despite the large price tag, the X-Band Radar replacement can't be used against other emerging threats, such as hypersonic boost glide vehicles or a cruise missile attack, Karako said.""The Pentagon's missile defense review isn't out yet, but it was specifically tasked by Congress to look at the full range of missiles,"" he said.To counter sophisticated emerging threats from near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, space-based sensors will be needed as ground-based radars are limited by the curvature of the earth.Still, ground-based radars like the one slated for Hawaii will still be necessary as they augment space-based radars' coverage.Space-based sensors have been discussed by every administration since President Reagan's but haven't made it off the drawing board.""I predict this year a decision will be made,"" Karako saidYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchThis U.S. Ally Buys Boeing Spy Planes As China Tension Heats UpAir Force Urges This New Hypersonic Weapons Mindset, Faster RolloutAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works

4,LMT,"SEATTLE — New Zealand will buy four Boeing (BA) P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare planes, as the U.S. ally steps up operations in the South China Sea.The P-8s, which will replace New Zealand's P-3 Orion fleet, will cost $1.6 billion and include training. They will be ready for operations starting in 2023.The order comes as New Zealand and other U.S. allies look to counter China's more aggressive stance in the region.Boeing stock rose 2.2% to 341.92 on the stock market today, still below its 50-day moving average.The U.S. Navy is the biggest customer for the P-8 and has 120 planes on order. But international sales can help keep costs down.""What we are doing is bundling U.S. Navy and international customers together so the U.S. Navy and the international customers get that lower unit price,"" Stephen Tripp, senior manager of global sales for the P-8 told IBD during a visit to the factory in June.  ""It's a challenge to bring new customers in a time that works for them clearly but also that works well in this collective bargaining.""Lower costs aren't the only advantage as tensions rise in the South China Sea and with Russia.""Everyone flying those jets work perfectly well with one another — compatible, interoperable; working together, all flying P-8s can share maintenance facilities,"" Tripp said.More foreign sales are expected soon and Tripp said his goal was to have two to three more customers signed up in the next two years.South Korea picked the P-8 in a contract worth $1.71 billion, a Boeing official told Reuters last month.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But military hardware sales to Turkey are in question as Congress considers blocking the sale of the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jet.The P-8 is a modified Boeing 737-800ERX, replacing Lockheed's P-3 Orion turboprop. The aircraft uses a high-power radar to scan for ships and submarines and a modified radar from the Boeing EA-18 Growler to scan for targets on land or near the coasts.Once a submarine is spotted, the aircraft can deploy sonobuoys to track and relay information about the location of hostile submarines. Or the plane can launch weapons like the Raytheon (RTN) Mark 54 Lightweight Hybrid Torpedo or Boeing's AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile. Winged torpedoes with a GPS guidance system are in development.Demand for anti-submarine capabilities is rising as China has accelerated its submarine building, increasing tensions in the South China Sea. Russia used submarines to launch strikes in Syria and has increased submarine activity in Europe.But the P-8 also assists in search and rescue efforts. It was involved in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, MH370, in 2014 and Argentina's missing submarine in 2017.The body of the jet is built in Boeing's current 737 production line in Renton, but with some modifications like a thicker skin, stiffer wings and a bomb bay door. Then the jet is flown down the street to the P-8 facility near Boeing Field.There it gets militarized and completes final testing.

5,LMT,"SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket received a massive boost with a $130 million military contract, just 4-1/2 months after its maiden flight.XThe private company, whose founder is Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, has been tasked with delivering the classified Air Force Space Command-52 satellite, according to an Air Force announcement late Thursday. The project is scheduled for completion by September 2020.Earlier in the week, the Air Force also certified the Falcon Heavy for national-security missions, despite the fact that the new rocket has only carried out one test launch in early February.SpaceX beat the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), in what is believed to be their first head-to-head contest for a heavy-lift mission. SpaceX's $130 million mission cost is much less than the $350 million minimum of a ULA Delta IV Heavy launch.The Air Force contract marks an additional vote of confidence after the Zuma spy satellite made by Northrop Grumman (NOC) was reportedly lost after launch by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in January.SpaceX said at the time that it ""did everything correctly,"" and reports later suggested the problem may have been with Northrop's custom-built adapter that was used to link its satellite with the Falcon 9.Boeing shares were up 0.4% on the stock market today, while Lockheed's shares were down 0.4%.The massive Falcon Heavy is 230 feet tall and consists of three Falcon 9 first-stage cores. Thrust from its 27 engines is equivalent to 18 Boeing 747s, making it two times more powerful than any other rocket operating today, according to SpaceX.Before awarding the latest contract to SpaceX for the classified satellite, the Air Force had already planned to use the Falcon Heavy in its Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites. That mission is scheduled for sometime this year.The Falcon Heavy has also secured commercial missions and so far has contracts to stage satellite launch missions for ViaSat, Inmarsat and Arabsat.Famously, the payload for its first launch back in February was Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster.

The new S-500 is also supposedly able to intercept hypersonic missiles, drones and other aircraft. It also is said to be capable of destroying objects in near-space, some 62 miles above the face of the Earth.If Russia's claims are accurate, the S-500 would offset a major advantage in U.S. warfighting capacity.The F-35 program, the most expensive military program ever at $400 billion, has faced criticism over cost overruns and combat effectiveness.The stealth fighter only recently flew its first-ever combat missions as part of an Israeli air force operation. The F-22 saw its first combat action in 2014 when the U.S. began its air campaign against ISIS.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Russia Has Lockheed's F-22, F-35 In Its Sights After Testing This New Missile Russia's Deadliest Air-Defense System Is Headed To This NATO AllyLockheed Martin's F-35 Stealth Fighter Makes Combat Debut In Israeli OperationDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

9,LMT,"President Donald Trump's push to establish a sixth military branch dedicated to space would probably be a lot more expensive than just extending the U.S. Air Force's capabilities -- and no doubt the nation's largest defense contractors love that idea.XBoeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) stand to gain more business from a new space force branch, said George Ferguson, a senior defense analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Spending would probably include ""communication/GPS/surveillance satellites and the ability to protect ours, degrade others, launch and build satellites,"" Ferguson wrote in an email.But those companies shouldn't get too excited yet. Any future ""Space Force"" spending would be modest given that it would need to compete with other big, politically protected Defense Department priorities Congress already funds.""We don't have numbers behind how much value, but are sure it will still be less than the large programs,"" such as the F-35 fighter jet, the Navy Virginia class submarines and Air Force B-21 Raider bomber, Ferguson said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Air Force has argued that space defense is well within its purview, and that a new branch not only isn't necessary, but could dilute current efforts to extend American military might into space.The idea for an independent effort dates to early 2017 when House members led by Representative Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican, began a new round of advocacy for what they called a separate ""space corps.""The commander-in-chief first broached the idea in March, calling it a ""Space Force,"" while addressing service members in California.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Space Warfare: Why The U.S. Is So Vulnerable, Despite SpaceX's WinsSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

""It seems crazy. It seems fantastic. But we are actually using relatively low-tech industrial components to break this problem into manageable chunks.""Alphabet shares rose 1.4% to 1160.11 on the stock market today.

11,LMT,"The Pentagon's estimated cost to develop and purchase Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 jet, the costliest U.S. weapons program, has stabilized for now, according to a new report to Congress.X The total acquisition cost for the advanced fighter is projected at $406.1 billion, virtually unchanged from the $406.5 billion estimated last year, according to the Defense Department's latest Selected Acquisition Report, which will be sent to Congress this week. The projections were obtained in advance by Bloomberg News.Within the total -- which includes research, development and initial support such as spare parts and military construction -- the estimated cost to procure 2,456 U.S. aircraft has ticked down to $345.4 billion from $346.1 billion, or a 0.2% decline.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportThat's good news for the F-35, which has wide support in Congress but a past marred by cost overruns. Last year, the annual acquisition report on major weapons estimated that costs would rise about 7 percent to $406.5 billion after several years of declining projections.The acquisition estimates are separate from a projection of about $1.1 trillion for long-term operations and support to keep the aircraft flying until 2070. Those costs have drawn the concern of the military services and Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, who's responsible for such ""sustainment"" expenditures.Lockheed and its subcontractors are trying to improve production processes as the Pentagon plans major increases in the pace of F-35 purchases. Parts shortages, unavailable aircraft and lingering unresolved technical issues also must be resolved as the program soon ends its 17-year development phase. In September, the F-35 is due to begin as much as one year of rigorous combat testing that's required by law.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Space Warfare: Why The U.S. Is So Vulnerable, Despite SpaceX's WinsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed F-35 Bulk Buy Plan Due As Modernization Bill Seen At $16 Billion

However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production.

But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic. On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio stood at 0.68. During the March 2000 tech market top, this ratio of bearish put options to bullish call options sank beneath 0.4. Such a low ratio pointed to a severe evaporation of bearish sentiment among options traders.The Investors Intelligence report on newsletter editors also shows the bullish ratio at 52.9%, well below its mid-January peak of 66%.

21,LMT,"President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which roiled the stock market less than three weeks ago, now look like a much smaller deal after big new exemptions were granted on Thursday, just before they were set to take effect.Yet dramatically shrinking metal tariffs were an afterthought on Thursday, as Trump made China the central front in his trade war and fear of retaliation against U.S. multinationals sent the stock market tumbling anew. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite tumbled well over 2% Thursday on Trump's confrontational trade policy. The major averages sold off into the close on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 losing 2.1%.China is showing maximum restraint for now. Overnight, Beijing said it would impose 25% tariffs on just $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, including pork, fruit, wine, steel pipe and recycled aluminum. That compares to Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese robotics, aerospace, biopharma and other goods that could amount to about $15 billion — 25% on roughly $60 billion worth of imports. Even Trump's tariffs look modest in comparison to the $375 billion U.S. goods trade deficit with China and the $60 billion in tariffs that were floated.A day after the stock market tumble, investors initially exhibited relief Friday that the near-term consequences may be limited, but the major averages turned mixed. Dow Jones components Boeing (BA) closed up 0.4%, while Caterpillar (CAT) fell 1.8%. Both fell more than 5% on Thursday.China did not lay out any measures that would negatively affect Boeing and Caterpillar, but they could be at risk if Beijing decides to step up its retaliatory measures.China's U.S. ambassador told Bloomberg that Beijing could scale back Treasury purchases in response.Investor relief over China's measured response may be limited because Trump's tariffs to punish Beijing for intellectual property theft likely mark the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic and geopolitical relations, which can't help but pose significant risks for U.S. multinationals.Trump said Thursday that the tariffs were just the ""first of many"" actions to reduce the U.S.-China deficit. China's U.S. ambassador said that his country is ""not afraid"" to fight a trade war.The Trump administration is targeting products that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. China, for its part, is saying that U.S. accusations of IP theft are without merit.The unstated rationale of Trump's actions are pretty clear: The U.S. wants to maintain technological — and military — leadership over China, and that goal has to take precedence over economic cooperation when the two come in conflict. At the announcement of the tariffs, Trump's plan got an endorsement from Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin (LMT). Lockheed's F-35 uses stealth technology that lets it evade detection. Shares of Lockheed rose 3% on Friday.The Trump administration appears to have made a sudden realization that launching a trade war with global trading partners over steel and aluminum would hamper Washington's efforts to contain the growing threat posed by China.The 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs were set to take effect on Friday, but the Trump administration clarified late Thursday that countries representing more than half of U.S. steel imports would receive exemptions through May 1. Exempted countries include European Union members, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, Australia and Argentina. After May 1, Trump could decide to permanently exempt those nations based on the status of talks.Steel stocks fell hard on Thursday after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer telegraphed the change in policy. On Thursday, shares of U.S. Steel (X) sank 11% to levels last seen before Trump ramped up his steel tariff talk in mid-February. Steel Dynamics (STLD) fell 7.5%, Nucor (NUE) 6.5% and AK Steel (AKS) 8.7%. Steel stocks extended losses Friday.The Obama administration has been a target of some criticism for an inadequate response to IP theft. Yet it did have a plan for maintaining a sphere of influence in East Asia and Southeast Asia, expanding markets for U.S. multinationals and providing stronger IP protections: the controversial Trans Pacific Partnership. Dropping out of that pact was among the first acts of Trump's presidency, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said in recent weeks that the U.S. could seek to rejoin the pact.Trump, by contrast, has been focused on bringing more U.S. intellectual property back home, through corporate tax cuts. But U.S. multinationals can't hope to serve global markets only from American shores. China, meanwhile, is laser-focused on deepening economic integration with economies throughout Asia through its 21st Century Silk Road initiative. The more the U.S. distances itself from trading partners, the easier it will be for China to emerge unscathed from a trade war.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Can You Spot Major Stock Market Tops?

24,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is gunning for a massive bulk order of F-35s to slash production costs, while Pentagon leaders weigh the expense of modernizing the stealth fighters that have already been produced.X The convergence of efforts is a product of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition strategy, which is to simultaneously produce jets and continue their development.Pentagon officials and Lockheed have for years pushed for a so-called block buy of F-35s, and a plan is going to be officially unveiled later this month. The purchase would include hundreds of the jets in a single multibillion dollar contract in the early 2020s to enable economies of scale. But such a deal would also involve more upfront costs.""Ultimately we all share the same enemy: cost. Our focus remains on achieving an $80 million airplane by 2020 and (we) believe the biggest levers to reduce cost beyond that are the use of economic order quantities, cost reduction initiatives, and a multiyear contract,"" Lockheed VP Jeff Babione, the firm's F-35 program leader, told the Wall Street Journal.However, it may face challenges as senior Pentagon officials have been frustrated by efforts to cut the cost of buying and flying the advanced combat planes over the past three years. This is despite Lockheed already trimming the average price of the F-35A to $95 million, from $122 million five years ago, with an aim to cut it further to $80 million by the end of the decade.Defense leaders are demanding more cuts, as annual production is already set to climb from 66 last year to around 150 jets in the early 2020s.Lockheed Martin stock finished 0.1% lower at 341.78 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 subcontractor, also dipped 0.1%, while United Technologies (UTX), which is building the engines for the F-35, edged up 0.3%.The tab is also coming due to modernize the more than 270 jets currently flying, and it could hit $16 billion.Citing the information provided by the Pentagon, Rep. Niki Tsongas said at a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing that costs will be split between $10.8 billion for software development and $5.4 billion for deploying the updates and other procurement expenses in support of the modernization efforts, according to Reuters.F-35 Joint Program Office head Vice Admiral Mathias Winter said the figure is the outer limit of the modernization costs however, and said the updates will enhance the jets' capabilities, bringing them to their maximum potential.""Continuous enhancements and improvements will be made to increase capabilities that make the F-35 more lethal and survivable,"" Winter told lawmakers.Meanwhile, the F-35's costs were an issue in Italy's recent election, and the Five Star party, which has vowed to scrap the country's participation in the F-35 program, is edging closer to to power.Italy is due to purchase 60 F-35As and 30 F-35Bs, at a cost of $14 billion, and has already taken delivery of nine F-35As from its own final assembly line at Cameri in northern Italy, according to Defense News.The Pentagon's other top combat aircraft program, the B-21 Raider bomber, is said to be on track despite production problems with the the engines and wings, including an air flow issue.House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee chair Rob Wittman, R-Va., hailed the work of prime contractor Northrop Grumman, particularly for how it has integrated its subcontractors together to solve the early design problems.""This is an extraordinary, complex aircraft. The issue is not that you have these uncertainties. The issue is how you address them,"" Wittman told Defense News at the McAleese/Credit Suisse defense conference.The B-21 is the most secretive program currently being undertaken by the U.S.The Air Force plans buy at least 100 of the aircraft for around $550 million each, with the total acquisition price tag estimated at up to $80 billion.

And by 2022, he said SpaceX plans to send a cargo mission to Mars with crewed missions eventually following.SpaceX is in full throttle development mode for the BFR, with all engineering resources focused on the BFR, and no major design updates are planned for the Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy.Shotwell also said Monday that customers have warmed to the idea of reusable boosters quicker than she expected and that half of the SpaceX's 31 launches this year will be on previously used boosters.Reusability has been a driving force in keeping launch costs down and increasing the number of launches per year, allowing SpaceX to step up planned launches this year by about 50% from last year.Shotwell added that after demonstrating reusable boosters, it's ""soul-crushing"" to throw away payload fairings, the nose cone of rockets. SpaceX would eventually like the to reuse the fairing.

31,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is on schedule to perform intense combat testing and will face the Cold War-era A-10 in a close air support face-off sometime this year.Vice Adm. Mat Winter, director of the Joint Strike Fighter program office, told reporters at a roundtable Wednesday that the F-35 will face the A-10 either as part of a close air support test scheduled to start in April or as part of its major full combat testing certification, which is on schedule to start in September and be finished by May 2019.Congress mandated the tests amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future. While warfighters cherish its ability to rain down massive firepower to support troops on the ground, the Air Force wants to retire the aging fleet to save money and meet constricted budget requirements.The F-35 was supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to maintain the so-called Warthog.For now, the A-10 is here to stay, as the Air Force asked for money in its 2019 budget request to replace the attack plane's wings.Lockheed shares closed down 1% at 352.44 on the stock market today.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportBack in 2015 the Pentagon's Office of Operational Test and Evaluation suggested a fly-off between the two planes, but Air Force officials called any potential test ""silly,"" saying the two planes perform different functions and the F-35's stealth capabilities allow it to enter high-threat environments.The F-35's close air support test is scheduled for April and will take place predominantly at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California.

39,LMT,"A successful test flight for SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket could set up its first commercial launch just three to six months later, said SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk Monday.X So far, conditions look good for the rocket, the most powerful since the Apollo program's Saturn V, to have its first test flight on Tuesday, he told reporters on a conference call. The launch window opens at 1:30 p.m. ET.""Amazingly it's looking like we're going to launch tomorrow,"" said Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and will launch his Tesla Roadster on the rocket. ""We will have a good time no matter what happens.""If the Falcon Heavy's flight Tuesday goes well, SpaceX has said it plans to use the rocket to launch an Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed Martin (LMT) sometime early this year. The Falcon Heavy also will be used in the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites, as early as April.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Meanwhile, SpaceX's plans to use the Falcon Heavy to take tourists on a trip around the moon have changed.Last year, the company found that development of another deep-space rocket dubbed the ""BFR"" was moving along faster than anticipated, Musk said.That means it may not be necessary for SpaceX to qualify both the Falcon Heavy and BFR for crewed flights and instead just qualify the BFR, he added.But if the BFR winds up taking longer to develop, then SpaceX would revisit using the Falcon Heavy, which Musk said has the capability to go farther than the Apollo missions did.It's the part of the spacecraft where the crew would ride that is proving to be most difficult, and that's where development efforts are focused, he said.As a vessel envisioned for human exploration of other planets, Musk noted it must be designed for different re-entry speeds and different atmospheres on various planets, as well as takeoffs and landings on unimproved terrain.""The ship is by far the hardest part,"" he said, though he hopes to have it conducting short flights next year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksSpaceX, Boeing To Take This Giant Leap For Space Industry In 2018

42,LMT,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is notorious for his overly optimistic goals, and he didn't hold back about his space company, even after his tantrum during Tesla's (TSLA) recent earnings call when analysts pressed him about the electric-vehicle company's lofty goals.Here are the top five far-out ideas he outlined during a call with reporters Thursday before the first launch of SpaceX's next-generation Falcon 9 rocket.In addition to delivering payloads to earth orbit, SpaceX has plans to send people to Mars and beyond, with an eventual goal of colonizing the red planet.Musk said that the fleet of spacecraft that will be necessary to achieve SpaceX's Mars ambitions will also put the cost and frequency of space travel on par with air travel on traditional airlines.The cost to passengers, however, is a different story. Musk and SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell earlier have suggested a ticket to Mars could cost $200,000 per person.Before SpaceX rocketed into the launch scene, rockets were one and done, which Musk likened the practice to using a Boeing (BA) 747 once and throwing it away.SpaceX has been reusing lower-stage boosters, which can land themselves soon after takeoff. But the upper stage, which goes into space, burns up ""like a meteor,"" according to Musk.Reusing the upper stage is trickier, because it must have enough fuel to return to Earth and survive the rigors of re-entry. But Musk vowed Thursday that SpaceX will achieve full reusability.Rival United Launch Alliance, a Boeing- Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, is looking at upper stage reusability with the company's Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage. But ULA sees that spacecraft being left in orbit for months or years and refueled.Full reusability would slash launch costs from $50 million-$60 million currently to just $5 million-$6 million, Musk estimated, saying ""that would be quite insane.""But Musk didn't give timelines or development outlines on how to achieve such a lofty goal.By comparison, ULA's launch price tag has been estimated at more than $200 million.The Falcon 9 block 5 is meant for quicker reuse and reportedly will have a stronger heat shield and new landing legs, among other improvements.Musk said that the new version of the Falcon 9 can be launched 10 times without maintenance, but with some refurbishing, it could be used up to 100 times.Even the low end of that range would be a huge leap. So far, SpaceX's relaunched rockets haven't exceeded two flights apiece.As the Falcon 9 Block 5 reduces maintenance requirements between launches, Musk said SpaceX plans to start reusing the engines and first stage for two consecutive launches in the same 24-hour period starting in 2019.Typically, it takes the company months to get the same rocket ready for another launch.Boeing shares closed down 0.5% on the stock market today.

43,LMT,"SpaceX launched its updated Falcon 9 Friday afternoon after a last-minute scrub Thursday, marking the first flight for a rocket that eventually will ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station for NASA.XFriday's launch of the Falcon 9 block 5 delivered a satellite owned by Bangladesh into orbit. Its reusable first-stage booster successfully landed on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean. The launch also marked SpaceX's ninth of the year as part of its plans for 30 total in 2018.SpaceX said the block 5 model is ""designed to be capable of 10 or more flights with very limited refurbishment"" and is the last upgrade to its Falcon 9 series as it looks to focus on its deep-space rocket, the BFR.The Falcon 9 block 5 is meant for quicker reuse and reportedly has a stronger heat shield and new landing legs, among other improvements.By shortening the turnaround time back into space and reducing the preparations needed for a new mission, SpaceX could lower the cost of launches even further. On Thursday, CEO Elon Musk boasted that each block 5 rocket could be reused 100 times and slash launch costs to $5 million-$6 million from $50 million-$60 million.The Falcon 9 block 5 is also the rocket that SpaceX plans to use for its ""space taxi"" program for NASA, which has also contracted with Boeing (BA) to take astronauts to the ISS and back, ending its reliance on Russia's space program.SpaceX has said it plans an initial crewed test flight of its space taxi later this year, though it could slip to next year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, SpaceX has pushed back the first flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket for a paying customer by several months to October.The Falcon Heavy had its maiden flight in February, sending up a Telsa (TSLA) Roadster and demonstrating a new maneuver for the Air Force that showed the rocket can directly insert a payload into its final orbit.SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO Musk said before the launch that a successful test flight could set up the Falcon Heavy's first launch for a paying customer just three to six months later.But due to ongoing qualification testing and engineering reviews, the first Falcon Heavy launch for the Air Force slipped from June to October.The Air Force mission is part of the Space Test Program-2 to test military and scientific research satellites.Altogether, the Falcon Heavy will launch with 25 spacecraft inside its nose cone, including six weather research satellites and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Demonstration and Science Experiments spacecraft.SpaceX also plans to use the Falcon Heavy to launch an Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed Martin (LMT) sometime at the end of the year, marking its second mission for a paying customer.The Falcon Heavy is 230 feet tall and consists of three Falcon 9 first-stage cores. Thrust from its 27 engines is equivalent to 18 Boeing 747s, making it two times more powerful than any other rocket operating today, according to SpaceX.It also has double the payload capacity of the Delta IV Heavy made by the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Boeing shares dipped 0.5% on the stock market today.

Lockheed Martin fell 2.2%, Raytheon lost 2.9%, General Dynamics dipped 0.7%, Harris dropped 2.4%, Huntington Ingalls eased 0.9% and Northrop Grumman sold off 2.1%.Spingarn said valuations are too high when current budget documents and political realities are taken into account.But despite the seemingly limited upside for hardware stocks, there are still some big winners.""Overall, we remain more bullish on Commercial Aerospace, where Boeing and Bombardier remain our two top picks across the sector,"" Spingarn said.Ironically, given their trade spat earlier this year, Bombardier was named the top pick ahead of Boeing. The next two top picks were General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, which have shipbuilding operations that should benefit from the Pentagon's focus on near-peer global rivals.However, the news was not as sunny for advanced weapons manufacturer Raytheon, as it was given a downgrade from outperform to neutral.

46,LMT,"The F-35 is preparing for key operational tests that will allow Lockheed Martin (LMT) to begin full-rate production on the stealth fighter and massively boost its growth.XAcquisition rules require the completion of combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), before Lockheed can crank out F-35s at full tilt.The F-35 underwent cold-weather testing at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, in February, as part pre-IOT&E activity. Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019. That event will also test the F-35's 3F software package, which provides 100% of the coding needed for full warfighting capability.It will also pit the F-35 against the venerable A-10 in a close air support matchup that Congress mandated amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future.The F-35 is supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to put off the planned retirement of the so-called Warthog.Lockheed has a lot riding on the tests.The F-35 program is key to Lockheed's growth as it accounts for about 25% of total revenue. The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year. By 2023, the company expects to reach 160 jets per year.Other defense stocks will also see a lift when F-35 output jumps. Northrop Grumman (NOC) builds the center fuselage and mission planning software, United Technologies (UTX) makes the engines, and Raytheon (RTN) is modifying its missiles and other weapons for the jet.Lockheed and Raytheon rose 0.5% in the stock market today while Northrop sank 0.55% and United Tech climbed 1.55%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""It's not to say it hasn't been treated seriously, but there is a very different mindset if you're moving towards 'we need to have an operational capability' vs. 'we're working on science and technology.'""Roper said that means getting out to do aggressive testing and being OK with failure.Lockheed shares dipped 0.4% to 32.84 on the stock market today, closing below their 200-day line for the first time since October 2016.

50,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. —  Light attack aircraft that are less expensive to buy and operate than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) cutting-edge F-35 or older fighters like Boeing's (BA) F-15 could help the U.S. attract new allies, a top Air Force officer said Monday.XThe Air Force is weighing whether light attack aircraft should become part of the U.S. fleet as well, and just began a second phase of experiments to compare Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine against the Sierra Nevada/Embraer (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano.The A-29, which at $10 million each costs about a tenth of Lockheed's F-35, is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The prospect of sharing an aircraft with the U.S. could be an incentive for countries to increase U.S. ties more broadly.""Lower that cost so we gain new allies with that light attack approach,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements, at a Mitchell Institute event. ""Not every country can afford an F-35 or even an F-15 or F-16. Partner with other countries that haven't been able to do so at this point.""Textron shares closed up 1.4% at 63.88 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last month. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares dipped 0.9%, Lockheed rallied 2%, and Boeing rose 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Air Force hasn't decided yet if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of up to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022. Harris also sounded eager to speed up the process.""We are doing our best to minimize new development and just take existing things on the shelf so we can speed the acquisition to get this in the fight sooner,"" he said.In a series of experiments that started today at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and interoperability tests. The experiments could also include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tests, Harris said.In the first phase of light attack experiments, which took place in August 2017, the Air Force looked at Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) in addition to the AT-6 and A-29. The four planes flew in both day and night tests, with and without weapons.The idea behind light attack aircraft is to save money by using them for more routine missions in low-risk environments, and deploy top-of-the-line, fifth-generation aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters for missions in more dangerous environments.Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano, for example, would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.""The price-per-kill today using precision weapons aboard fifth-gen fighters is exorbitant, "" Harris said. ""And we've been paying that price for decades.""Editor's note: this story has been updated to corrected the location of the second-phase experiments.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsF-35 Prepares For Combat Tests That May Unleash Lockheed Growth

51,LMT,"Raytheon (RTN) expects missile defense demand to remain strong, in the Asia region specifically, regardless of what happens in expected U.S.-North Korea talks, as the maker of the Patriot defense system reported strong Q1 earnings.The Trump administration dispatched CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang earlier for preliminary discussions, and negotiations between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un may start in the next month or so. Meanwhile, North Korea has already announced it would stop nuclear missile tests.But Raytheon CFO Toby O'Brien told IBD that he sees demand across all regions of the world and doesn't see that slowing down any time soon.Regional customers also continue to modernize their arsenals with increased demand for new capabilities, such as the latest version of the Standard Missile-3 and the Standard Missile-6.The Patriot missile-defense system remained a strong driver of Q1 results. Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems unit saw sales rise 7% to $1.49 billion, led by an international Patriot contract award. During Q1, the unit booked over $2 billion for Patriot capabilities to the U.S. and its allies.Earnings per share from continuing operations jumped 27% to $2.20, beating Zacks Investment Research estimates by 10 cents. Net sales climbed 4.5% to $6.27 billion, better then views for $6.17 billion.Intelligence, Information and Services revenue grew 5% to $1.58 billion. Missile Systems sales climbed 5% to $1.85 billion, led by higher net sales on classified programs. Space and Airborne Systems sales edged up 1% to $1.57 billion.Missile sales should get a further boost after the State Department cleared the way last month for Saudi Arabia to buy nearly 6,700 Raytheon anti-tank missiles following Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington, D.C., as the Trump administration relaxes export restrictions on U.S. weapons.Bookings improved to $6.3 billion from $5.7 billion a year ago. Total backlog at the end of Q1 was $38.14 billion, down from $38.21 billion at the end of 2017 but up from $36.05 billion a year ago. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $283 million compared to an outflow of $41 million a year ago.Raytheon now sees full-year EPS at $9.70-$9.90, above consensus for $9.69 and up from its prior views of $9.55-$9.75, on net sales of $26.5 billion-$27 billion, vs. consensus for $26.81 billion, up from a prior view of $26.4 billion-$26.9 billion. Management still sees 2018 operating cash flow at $3.6 billion-$4 billion but said it is also tracking above views.""We delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter with our sales, earnings per share and cash flow all ahead of our expectations,"" Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said in a statement.Shares were down 1.2% at 211.09 on the stock market today, slipping into sell territory intraday after breaking out last week. Defense stocks were slammed this week after Lockheed Martin (LMT) didn't raise its cash flow guidance after raising the outlook on EPS, revenue and other key financial figures amid a steep increase in Pentagon spending.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

""Not going to get rid of conventional missile technology. There is going to be a time and place for both.""Raytheon's results also follow U.S.-led air strikes in Syria earlier this month that involved the company's Tomahawk cruise missiles.But Russia claimed this week that it took possession of an unexploded Tomahawk and will use it to improve its own weapons, according to the TASS government run news agency. U.S. officials have refuted those claims, according to a CNBC report.O'Brien said in an interview that he heard of the report but referred comment to the Pentagon.On Wednesday, Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported Q1 earnings and revenue above Wall Street estimates, but kept cash flow and sales guidance flat. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views when it announced results Wednesday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingBoeing Nearly Done With China Plant, Brushes Off Trade-War FearsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

Caterpillar (CAT), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) stirred Dow futures early, as crude oil prices gained and investors dug into the session's long list of earnings results.Dow futures rose 0.6%, as Caterpillar forged a strong early lead, but premarket losses from Travelers (TRV) and 3M (MMM) limited gains. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.7%.

54,LMT,"U.S. defense giants Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) will be aiming to shoot down Russian and European rivals in the war to win the world's biggest fighter jet contest.XIndia's air force formally asked companies Friday to submit proposals for 110 fighter jets, currently the globe's largest such order. India seeks 75% single-seat aircraft, with the remainder being twin-seat planes.The order could be worth at least $15 billion, Rahul Bedi, a New Delhi-based analyst at Jane's Information Services, told Bloomberg. Boeing and Lockheed will be vying against Russia's United Aircraft Corp., which makes MiG fighters, Sweden's SAAB, France's Dassault Aviation and the Eurofighter Typhoon.The request for information will be open until July. A request for proposals will follow. After evaluating bids and negotiating contracts, the process could take years. The first aircraft must be delivered within three years of signing the contract.In a bid to curry favor, Lockheed previously said it would move all F-16 production to India if it wins the contest, as local production is a key requirement to the deal. Boeing has also offered to set up an F/A-18 Super Hornet manufacturing facility in the country.Meanwhile, the Indian navy plans to award a separate $10 billion contract for 57 fighters. Boeing's Super Hornet is seen as a front-runner in that contest.Boeing stock sank 3.1% at 326.12 on the stock market today, after President Trump threatened to double down on tariffs against China, a major customer for Boeing's commercial jets. Lockheed Martin fell 3.4%, back below its 50-day average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIndia's air force and navy require up to 400 single- and double-engine combat aircraft, according to the government. But the procurement process has seen some twists and turns. In 2007, New Dehli awarded an $11 billion contract to Dassault Aviation for 126 Rafale jets.However, the government scrapped the deal in 2015 after clashes over price and quality guarantees. Instead, it bought 36 jets separately as a stopgap measure before reopening a new competition.In February, India reportedly asked its air force if its fighter requirements could be expanded to include twin-engine jets after Lockheed's F-16s and Saab's Gripen single-engine offerings were the only jets to meet prior requirements. That opened the door to Boeing's twin-engine Super Hornet and Russia's MiG.India is looking for day-and-night capable, all-weather combat aircraft that will fulfill a number of key roles. These include providing air superiority and air defense, as well as carrying out air-to-surface, reconnaissance and maritime operations.The country wants new fighter jets amid rising threats from neighbors Pakistan and China. The mainstay of its current fleet is Soviet-era MiG fighters. But India is phasing out those aging aircraft.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: This Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action Plan  Boeing Falls As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll In; GE, United Tech Recover Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

58,LMT,"Boeing (BA) topped Q4 estimates Wednesday and offered upbeat guidance for the coming year as recent tax cuts unlock more investment, which could go toward developing a new passenger jet.X The aerospace giant expects to spend $3.7 billion on research and development in 2018, up from $3.2 billion last year, with capital investment expected to climb to $2.2 billion from $1.7 billion.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said tax reforms would increase Boeing's ability to invest in innovation as well as the underlying production and supply chain, ""solidifying the business case"" of the new midmarket plane.""If we launch, it would give us additional confidence,"" he added.But the company wouldn't say if it would make a decision on the new plane this year, saying it had a lot of time to do its research and the tax cut didn't change its project time frame of 2024-2025 to start deliveries if it decides to launch a new plane.Muilenburg also said that the decision on the new plane wasn't impacted by talks to acquire a major stake in Brazilian planemaker Embraer (ERJ). But sources earlier told Bloomberg that Boeing would get Embraer engineers' expertise to help jump-start the new midmarket plane.Boeing also said it would use tax savings for training and workplace investments, but it has no plans to increase hiring to make up for rounds of layoffs in recent years.Shares surged 4.9% to 354.27 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high.

That beat analysts' views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, beating views for $24.83 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue grew 8% to $15.47 billion. Earlier, Boeing said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Net orders for 414 commercial planes were booked in Q4, with the backlog at more than 5,800 airplanes valued at $421 billion. The defense backlog was $50 billion, of which 40% represents orders from international customers.

Boeing has already said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Boeing's improving operational efficiency has lifted cash flow, and in October management raised its overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion.That has raised hopes for bigger shareholder returns, and investors were rewarded in December, when Boeing announced an $18 billion repurchase program and raised its dividend 20% to $1.71.Since then, the White House and Congress have enacted a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, providing companies with even more cash to potentially return to shareholders.

Carlton Everhart, the head of Air Mobility Command, told the Air Force Times that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration could get final FAA certification for the KC-46 in the next 60-70 days.Defense contractors have had a positive earnings season overall. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat earnings and revenue forecasts Monday and issued strong full year guidance.Last week, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon on GD missed on revenue while Northrop beat and gave strong 2018 guidance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Lockheed Martin Beats Earnings, Revenue Views, Guides Profit HighBoeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape Sector

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all moved down around 0.3%.X Among the Dow Jones industrials, Apple (AAPL) fell further under its 50-day line, trading nearly 2% lower. The stock has been a significant underperformer even as it tried to break out above a 176.34 buy point in mid-December. Shares are about 5% below that level ahead of Thursday's earnings release.Elsewhere in the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise early Monday. The stock is hitting a new 52-week high and is extended from a 247.17 buy point in an eight-month saucer with handle after a recent test of the 50-day line.FANG stocks Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) bucked the market's early fall with rises of 0.6% and 2%, respectively. Both are well-extended from recent buy points after strong advances in 2018.Among companies reporting earnings, Lockheed Martin (LMT) notched a new high with an over-2% rise after the defense contractor topped the Street's Q4 estimates. The stock moved out of buy range from a 322.29 flat-base entry Friday. Shares are now about 9% from that level.Leaderboard name Weibo (WB) fell 3% after the Chinese government suspended several of the company's internet portals for obscene content.

The stock had been on a tear in 2018, but today's sell-off brings it back to its 50-day line, a key support level.Video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) was breaking out with a 1% gain. The stock exceeded a 120.28 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

Shares were testing a 142.90 cup-shaped base entry.Meanwhile, Lam Research (LRCX) fell 3%, as the stock continued lower from last Thursday's earnings-related retreat.

63,LMT,"Defense earnings are on tap this week after the Pentagon announced a shift in focus from fighting terrorism to near-peer threats but quarterly results and guidance will be dominated by recent tax cuts.X General Dynamics (GD) will kick off Q4 results on Wednesday with Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) on tap for Thursday and in an unusual move Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) will report the following week.""In general this quarter will be fairly noisy with tax reform, with companies coming out and providing information on how that will impact them going forward,"" said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones. ""There will be some charges (to earnings) and some noise that will be a little challenging to look through that to see what the outlook is for the rest of the year.""Last week, the Pentagon released the 2018 National Defense Strategy with a shift in focus to ""great power competition"" instead of terrorism, prioritizing high end weapons like Lockheed's F-35 fifth-generation fighter and the nuclear recapitalization program.""I think clearly the fundamentals still remain longer term very positive and .... the National Defense Strategy release last Friday points to helping build the political foundation for budget increases in highly specialized areas of investment"" like space and unmanned systems, said Ken Herbert, managing director at Canaccord Genuity.While the strategy lays out long-term spending priorities, the Defense Department still doesn't have a budget yet for 2018 and Congress continues to lurch through short-term budgets that carry over prior spending levels. Herbert expects ""timing around fiscal '18 budget will continue to be a headwind and negative overhang.""On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of tax reform, up 32.3% to $2.50, beating analyst exceptions.  Revenue rose 8.1% to $8.3 billion, but fell short.Northrop reports early Thursday, and EPS is seen climbing 3.4% to $2.75 with revenue dipping 0.4% to $6.37 billion. Analysts would like to get answers about the failed deployment of Northrop's Zuma satellite, but so far the company has kept quiet about the launch earlier this month, citing the classified nature of the mission.Little is known about the Zuma satellite except that Northrop made it for a government customer and it was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. But sources told Bloomberg that the Falcon 9's second stage failed, with both the satellite and the second-stage booster falling into the ocean.Raytheon also reports early Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 7.4% to $2.02 with revenue climbing 9.6% to $6.83 billion. Missile defense sales are in the spotlight as international partners like Romania and Poland look to beef up defenses against Russia with new Raytheon-built Patriot systems.In general, ""international sales will be asked about a lot because that's been very strong,"" Canaccord's Herbert said, as the Trump administration has pushed for more foreign sales vs. prior administrations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.While Lockheed is typically the first defense contractor to report, its results come out next week, on Jan. 29. EPS is seen jumping 25% to $4.06 with revenue up 7.3% to $14.75 billion.With international demand for Raytheon's missile-defense products rising, sales of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will also be scrutinized.Windau also expects more commentary on F-35 production, as it ramps up to full tilt, as well as progress on cutting costs. Last week, the State Department gave Belgium approval to purchase 34 F-35s valued at $6.53 billion to replace its Lockheed F-16s.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

We are short-circuiting that. It's now going to be a matter of days. If they're our allies we are going to help them get this important, great military equipment.""Trump has frequently used appearances with foreign leaders to pitch the benefits of U.S. weapons sales and his push to bolster defense spending by NATO allies is expected to aid American companies. Recent State Department approvals for weapons sales included $300 million of rockets and support equipment to Qatar and $2.9 billion in weapons, including F-16 jets, to Slovakia.The president's promise of approval for weapons exports in ""days"" is unlikely.Sales, even to close allies, will continue to be reviewed under criteria including whether they support national security interests, how they affect the military balance in the country's region and whether they might have an adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness.The policy announced Thursday wouldn't truncate the elaborate back-and-forth between a prospective foreign customer and the State Department and military services to determine a country's requirements, supply pricing and availability information and sign a formal ""letter of offer and acceptance"" before the package goes to Congress.Under long-standing practice, Congress has the key role in determining whether a proposed arms sale gets final approval.The State Department typically submits proposed sales for an informal notification period of about three weeks that's followed by a formal, publicly released document that Congress has as long as 30 days to approve. This formal congressional notification and review period for NATO allies is 15 days.Kaidanow said the salesmanship challenge includes recognizing ""that because the quality of our product is so high, sometimes, for example, it is more expensive than others."" She said the review would include ""financial advocacy"" that would help other countries buy U.S. products.Administration officials insisted human rights -- including the risk of civilian casualties -- will remain a consideration in arms sales. But they repeated a mantra that ""economic security is national security.""""When we enable our allies and partners to more easily obtain appropriate American defense articles and services, we improve our national security,"" Navarro said.

71,LMT,"Boeing (BA) said an aircraft completion center in China is nearly finished as it downplayed U.S.-China trade war fears, after easily beating first-quarter forecasts and raising its guidance Wednesday.In March, President Trump announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, and China retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. products, including some Boeing jets.""We're frankly encouraged by the continued dialogue,"" between the U.S. and China, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said during the company's first-quarter earnings call.He noted that Boeing has been engaged with Beijing for years, adding that executives are making a visit to China.He also said the company wasn't seeing any material effect ""right now"" from inflation on aluminum or other raw material costs.While fears of a trade war have since eased with China's counter-tariffs seen having a limited impact on Boeing, the country remains a key source of aviation growth and a potential vulnerability going forward.In the past three years, one out of four airplanes Boeing makes, including one in three 787 Dreamliners, was delivered to customers in China.And some 40% of Boeing's backlog, which represents about seven years of production, is for customers in the Asia-Pacific region, Boeing officials said in January.Meanwhile, Boeing is working to open its long-planned aircraft completion center for 737s sold to Chinese customers by the end of the year, Muilenburg said.Shares closed up 4.2% at 342.86 on the stock market today, after falling 2.9% Tuesday amid the broad market sell-off.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

But now that timeline is likely delayed.Meanwhile, Boeing's unmanned test of its Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner capsule is due in August, and its crewed test is scheduled for November, but the company reportedly has warned the crewed test could be pushed back to 2019.Boeing shares closed up 2.5% at 336.21 on the stock market today.

""If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible.""The launch had been delayed from November so SpaceX could analyze data from the protective nose cone from another launch.In October, Wired reported that Northrop custom built an adapter to marry up its satellite with the Falcon 9, rather than use SpaceX's standard interface. Northrop declined to comment, citing the classified nature of the Zuma mission.Northrop shares closed up 0.7% at 310.39 on the stock market today.

88,LMT,"If your ETF tumbled in the market sell-off, consider it a good sign if it's bouncing off the 50-day moving average.X That's what iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) is trying to do, after it came 10.6% off its Feb. 1 peak. Shares are near the 50-day line. If it bounces back above the line, it would give the ETF a follow-on entry. But bear in mind that the stock market is on shakier ground, and buying any stock or ETF is riskier right now.The fund's so-far bullish reaction mirrors that found in the charts of its major components. Boeing (BA) is near new highs after making a second pullback to the 10-week moving average, a cousin of the 50-day average plotted on weekly IBD Charts.The company — the largest iShares U.S. Aerospace holding, accounting for more than 12% of  its portfolio — is seeing strong demand for its commercial jets, despite stiff competition from Airbus (EADSY). Reports say Boeing will form a joint venture with Embraer (ERJ) on the Brazilian company's regional jets.United Technologies (UTX) (8% of the portfolio) briefly erased a 13% gain from its 123.38 buy point before it bounced back temporarily. Lockheed Martin (LMT) (nearly 8%), Raytheon (RTN) (6.5%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) (about 6%) have risen from pullbacks to the 50-day line.While the commercial plane business is helping mainly Boeing and its suppliers, the defense side of the ETF is witnessing its own boom. The Pentagon's National Defense Strategy published last month shows a shift from anti-insurgency warfare to fighting traditional foes such as Russia and China.""With the heightened focus on near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia, we believe support for increased defense spending, and more importantly some of the specific areas of focus, will remain high,"" analysts at Canaccord Genuity noted in a Jan. 22 report.In the Defense Department paper, nuclear forces, cyberspace warfare, missile defense and command and control systems were some of the areas where modernization is planned, and where major defense contractors could play significant roles.Aerovironment (AVAV), Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) and Cubic (CUB) are smaller holdings of iShares U.S. Defense that Canaccord says have high percentages of their business in defense. The fund has 40 total holdings.Defense spending rarely goes out of fashion, and the fund has a good long-term track record. As of year-end, its three-year average annual total return is 19.2%, the five year return is 23.9% and the 10-year is 12.1%, according to the iShares website.RELATED:Boeing's Cash Flow Could Jump 35%; Lockheed Cash Boom Also SeenLockheed Martin, Raytheon Missile Defense System Fails Test Over Hawaii2 Defense ETFs Near Buy Points As U.S. Faces North Korea ThreatBoeing, Embraer Will Reportedly Form Commercial Jet Joint Venture

Seoul already has one of the 14,300-ton, 653-foot ships and a second is scheduled for deployment in 2020, according to Military.com.Meanwhile, Japan is mulling the F-35B for use on its helicopter carriers as it looks to defend its smaller islands against China's growing maritime presence, government sources told The Japan Times.The U.S. Marines approved the F-35B for combat in 2015, and a squadron is deployed in Japan. The U.K. and Italian air forces will also operate the F-35B.Lockheed shares were up 0.8% at 322.10 on the stock market today, just below a 322.29 buy point. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the program, rose 0.7%, and United Technologies (UTX), which makes engines for the F-35, added 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The F-35Bs would complement the significant commitments from the two countries. South Korea has ordered 40 F-35As and earlier this month announced plans to buy 20 more, while Japan has ordered 42 F-35As.Interest in additional stealth fighters comes as North Korea has made rapid progress on its nuclear and missile programs.Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles just seconds after takeoff.Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted in a report earlier this month.In particular, Northrop has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape SectorDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsPentagon's No. 2 Has This Confusing 'Mindset' On Lockheed's F-35

91,LMT,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense contractors have key contracts in their sights in 2018 that could reshape the industry for years to come.The Air Force is looking for a new trainer plane to replace its aging fleet of Northrop T-38C Talons and will decide in July who receives about $16 billion to produce 350 aircraft.X A Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries team is offering the T-50A, an upgraded version of the T-50 already in service in South Korea. Boeing is working with Saab to build a clean-sheet design. Italy's Leonardo is offering the T-100, but is a very long shot.The stakes are especially high for Boeing, which needs a new fighter contract as F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet production slows and demand shifts to Lockheed's next-generation F-35. If Boeing loses, it could be forced to make major job cuts at its St. Louis plant. Boeing showed off its offering recently.Lockheed is touting the proven effectiveness of the T-50A and says it can be ready on day one for the Air Force, which is looking to field the fighters as quickly as possible. On the other hand, Boeing's new design is seen as having ""more robust"" capabilities  and offers pilots extra flexibility in the cockpit.""Each team thinks they are the obvious right choice,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS. ""I think the possibly of a bid protest is high because the companies are so convinced they are right.""Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, gives the T-50A a slight advantage: ""They have no upfront costs and it's a highly cost based contract, a classic price shoot out.""The Navy is looking to field the first carrier-based drone for aerial refueling, and a contract award is expected in September. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.The competition is down to Lockheed, Boeing, and privately held General Atomics after Northrop Grumman announced it was dropping out of the race in October.Before dropping out of the contest, Northrop was seen as one of the front-runners as its X-47B prototype had been used in take off and landing demonstrations from aircraft carriers.Now, Lockheed is likely in the lead as its offering would be able to handle upgrades to strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, said Mark Bobbi and Derrick Maple, experts at IHS Markit. But if cost is the main concern then General Atomics is the likely winner.By the end of March, the Air Force expects to award a contract for hypersonic strike weapons that can fly five times the speed of sound and would be launched from fighters and bombers.Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN), and Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop, are bidding on the contract.Hypersonic weapons could be the most disruptive battlefield technology since stealth, combining speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them nearly impossible to shoot down with today's technology.The contract will help push the Air Force to ""accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies"" a spokesman for the service said as China and Russia race to close the gap in technology.High-tempo operations in the Middle East and rising tensions in Europe have put a priority on fielding modernized ground vehicles. The Army plans to award two engineering and manufacturing development contracts by the end of 2018 for a new light tank.So far, bidders include General Dynamics (GD), BAE Systems and a team led by Science Applications (SAIC), according to Defense News.The Marine Corps is also expected to decide between BAE Systems and Science Applications for its Amphibious Combat Vehicle contract in 2018. The service plans to build 204 of the vehicles to replace its aging amphibious assault vehicle fleet.Key foreign contests will formally kick off in 2018, though awards will come later.By mid-2018, France and Germany plan to agree on a roadmap for jointly developing a next-generation fighter. But the new jet is unlikely to be available by 2025, so Germany is looking at Boeing's F-15 and Super Hornet as well as Lockheed's F-35 as possible stopgaps until then.India expects to open competition for a carrier-based fighter jet by the middle of the year. New Dehli is in dire need of new planes as its 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft, are nearing the end of their service lives.Finland is in the market for 64 jets to replace its Boeing F/A-18 Hornets and will ask for offers from Boeing and Lockheed early next year along with some European firms. But a contract award isn't expected until 2021.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

92,LMT,"The private-sector space industry could be just months away from a game-changing milestone: launching astronauts into space on rockets from SpaceX and  Boeing (BA).X SpaceX, founded by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, already launches capsules for NASA to resupply the International Space Station. But those don't have humans on board. Certifying spacecraft that can safely and reliably deliver astronauts to space would mark the biggest leap ahead to date for a rapidly growing commercial space sector.""As soon as people enter the picture, it's really a giant step up in making sure things go right,"" Musk said at the International Space Station Research and Development conference in July. ""The oversight from NASA is much tougher.""For 30 years, NASA used its fleet of space shuttles to take astronauts to and from space, until they were decommissioned in 2011. Since then, the space agency has had to book rides on Russia's space program.But that is about to change as NASA turns to the private sector for ""space taxi"" services while it focuses more on deep-space exploration. In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract and SpaceX a $2.6 billion contract to develop spacecraft for missions to the International Space Station.Test flights and certifications for manned missions were initially seen by the end of 2017. But the schedule has since slipped, and now SpaceX's uncrewed mission is set for April and its manned test is in August. Boeing's unmanned test is due in August, and its crewed test is scheduled for November.If all goes well, regular manned missions to the ISS will start in 2019. NASA plans to pay both Boeing and SpaceX for up to six launches each, with no plans to downselect to just one launch provider in the future. Keeping two providers handy would also help guarantee that NASA wouldn't have to turn to another country again.""The U.S. doesn't have the capability to launch its own crew from U.S. soil at the moment, like we had with the shuttle,"" said John Elbon, head of the development of integrated strategy for Boeing's Human Space Flight Programs. ""Right now there are only two countries — Russia and China, not the U.S. — and that's not a good thing.""Contracting with a U.S. provider is also expected to save money. At two launches per year, NASA estimates each seat will cost $54 million vs. the $81.8 million per seat the U.S. paid the Russians in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: A new space age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  But Boeing's design doesn't completely end America's reliance on Russia as the capsule will be launched on an Atlas V rocket, which has a Russian-built engine.United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, is building a new Vulcan rocket with a U.S.-built engine to replace the Atlas V.Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space startup, which is developing the BE-4 engine, and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), which is developing the AR1, are competing to power the first stage of the Vulcan.Meanwhile, Boeing is also developing its Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner capsule to fit up to seven astronauts, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule is also expected to carry seven.SpaceX plans to launch its capsule on an upgraded version of the Falcon 9 rocket known as Block 5, which is currently in development.The coming year will also see another key milestone for SpaceX as the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V moonshot behemoth, the Falcon Heavy, is scheduled to have its maiden flight in January. (In fact, SpaceX has even said it plans to send two unnamed passengers on a round trip to the moon sometime in 2018 using the Falcon Heavy and Dragon capsule.)The Falcon Heavy consists of two first-stage boosters from Falcon 9 rockets on either side of a central booster that's a modified version of the Falcon 9. The Heavy, which will also be reusable, is expected to have double the payload capacity of the current top dog, United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy, and is already scheduled to launch three commercial satellites and an Air Force payload.Longer term, SpaceX and Boeing both expect to face off in a race to put astronauts on Mars. Earlier this year, Musk said it's possible a mission without a crew could reach Mars in 2022, followed by crewed missions in 2024. But Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has vowed that his company will be the first to send humans to Mars.""I describe that competition as a golf match,"" Elbon said. ""We as a Boeing team have to play our own ball. It's not a game where you play the other team. We are developing these capsules and we'll fly it working on getting our costs competitive; look at the score card and see what you've got vs. other folks.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: How SpaceX Could Disrupt Boeing, Airbus And The Airline IndustrySpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks NowSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks

93,LMT,"WASHINGTON — Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan wants the ""mindset"" that the Pentagon's costliest weapons program ever, Lockkheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, is churning out stealth fighters at full tilt — even though it's nowhere near that level.X His remarks contrast with the typically careful language from other program officials, who have been very deliberate about their choice of words to be as transparent as possible in describing each step in the controversial $400 billion program, which has been blasted for being over-budget and behind schedule.This year, Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s, and will start production and delivery of 90 jets in 2018, as low-rate production ramps up. Lockheed expects to hit-full rate production of 160 jets per year by 2023.But at a press briefing Thursday, Shanahan said Lockheed has reached full-rate production:""How do we really leverage up on the performance there? They've gone now from a development status to full-rate production. So since we've got this steady state of full-rate production how do you make that, you know, run like a sewing machine?""Lockheed shares closed down 0.2% at flat at 317.19 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a top F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.7%. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines, rose 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Lockheed has been gearing up for full-rate production at its factory in Fort Worth, Texas, and hiring more workers. But acquisition rules require full combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, before the F-35 can advance to the full-rate phase.Shanahan is no stranger to the specific terminology used by Pentagon's acquisition programs as he was Boeing's (BA) senior vice president for supply chain and operations until his appointment to the Pentagon's No. 2 spot in July.When pressed about his choice of words by reporters, Shanahan acknowledged he wasn't technically correct. But in his mind, the program is already at full-rate production and that if it waited until 2020 to ""start behaving differently, I think we've missed an opportunity.""""We should be thinking about the mindset and behaviors and how we are leveraging productivity of a full-rate environment,"" he added, saying he doesn't think Lockheed has a long way to go with its production ramp-up.The company said in a statement that Shanahan recently toured Fort Worth production line and is on track to meet increasing production rates as well as support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation next year.The Pentagon's F-35 joint program office said in a statement that the the program is ""moving at a full sprint,"" noting that ""over the next five years"" the F-35 will see the largest growth across its development, production and sustainment efforts.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point.

But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines.

107,LMT,"HOUSTON — While SpaceX is focused on going straight to Mars, Boeing (BA) said a less direct route to the red planet would help build infrastructure for future missions, including commercial ones.XSpaceX, started by Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk, is building its largest rocket to date, dubbed the BFR, to send humans to Mars and beyond. Earlier this week, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said the rocket would be ""orbital in 2020 or so"" after ""short hops"" planned for next year. By 2022, SpaceX plans to send a cargo mission to Mars with crewed missions eventually following.But the Trump administration is pushing for a return to the moon, with a lunar base, reversing the Obama administration's policies that focused on getting to Mars without landing on the moon.NASA, which has contracted with Boeing to develop the Space Launch System deep-space rocket, determines federal space policy and has laid out a path to Mars that includes stops at the International Space Station and a lunar orbiter or base. The idea is that the ISS could be used to learn about long-duration human spaceflight, while the moon could be used to test new tools for Mars missions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMatt Duggan, Boeing's deep-space exploration architect, said smaller steps would also leave behind infrastructure that commercial companies could use.""If we go straight to Mars we run the risk of not having anything left over,"" he said in a recent interview at Boeing's facility near NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.The Apollo program was a stunning success but there wasn't any infrastructure left behind upon which to build for later missions further into space.""The case for the moon is that it's partly about the resources,"" Duggan said. ""It may make sense to make an investment there to start and get those resources. I also think that a moon base goes a lot further to enabling commercial participation in a Mars trip.""Right now there aren't many opportunities for commercial companies to earn money on a trip to Mars, besides getting paid by the government. Duggan said a focus on either a lunar orbital facility or lunar base could prompt science, cargo deliveries, resource mining and other commercial activity.NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab has noted that the moon holds water that could support life and be converted to rocket fuel, helium-3 that could be used in nuclear fusion, and rare earth metals that could be used in a variety of commercial technologies.Boeing shares dipped 0.1% on the stock market today, down 6.9% so far this week. Lockheed Martin (LMT), which is building the Orion capsule for Boeing's forthcoming SLS, rallied 0.5%, and Tesla slipped 0.3%.No matter the route NASA decides to take to Mars, Duggan said Boeing's SLS will launch the public payloads that go there.Duggan reiterated a comment by Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who said in December that Boeing's new rocket would beat SpaceX's BRF in sending humans to Mars.""I think the government will get there first over a private industry,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: How The International Space Station Could Operate CommerciallySpace Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks

108,LMT,"Efforts to improve the reliability of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 are ""stagnant,"" undercut by problems such as aircraft sitting idle over the last year awaiting spare parts from the contractor, according to the Pentagon's testing office.X The availability of the fighter jet for missions when needed -- a key metric -- remains ""around 50 percent, a condition that has existed with no significant improvement since October 2014, despite the increasing number of aircraft,""  Robert Behler, the Defense Department's new director of operational testing, said in an annual report delivered Tuesday to senior Pentagon leaders and congressional committees.The F-35 section, obtained by Bloomberg News, outlined the status of the costliest U.S. weapons system as it's scheduled to end its 16-year-old development phase this year. Starting in September, the program is scheduled to proceed to intense combat testing that's likely to take a year, an exercise that's at least 12 months late already. Combat testing is necessary before the plane is approved for full-rate production -- the most profitable phase for Lockheed.Pentagon officials including Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and chief weapons buyer Ellen Lord have highlighted the need to reduce the F-35's $406.5 billion projected acquisition cost and its estimated $1.2 trillion price tag for long-term operations and support through 2070. Still, the Defense Department is moving to accelerate contracting and production for the fighter despite the persistence of technical and reliability issues disclosed in the current phase of development testing.Those issues include the increasing number of planes that are down awaiting spare parts, difficulties with the electro-optical targeting system and flaws in launching air-to-air missiles and GPS-guided air-to-ground munitions during weapons testing.A final version of the plane's complex software has gone through 31 variations and has yet to be deployed because of ""key remaining deficiencies,"" the report found. The troubles also include more mundane issues, such as tires on the Marine Corps version of the plane, the F-35B, that are proving less than durable.The upcoming testing, ""which provides the most credible means to predict combat performance, likely will not be completed until"" December 2019, according to the testing office.By the end of testing designed to demonstrate that the F-35 is operationally effective and suitable for its missions more than 600 aircraft already will have been built. That's about 25 percent of a planned 2,456 U.S. jets; 265 have been delivered to date.Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 program office, and Lockheed spokeswoman Carolyn Nelson had no immediate comment on the new testing office report.In an earlier statement, Nelson said Lockheed's 66 F-35 deliveries in 2017 represented ""more than a 40 percent increase from 2016, and the F-35 enterprise is prepared to increase production volume year-over-year to hit full rate of approximately 160 aircraft in 2023.""

Defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT), which is not on the Dow but is an S&P 500 stalwart, also broke out of a consolidation on Friday but was under pressure early Monday.Apple rose 1.5% to 176.52 in morning trade in Friday's stock market trading, clearing 176.34 buy point and hitting a record high. On Friday, Apple carved out a flat base with the minimum five weeks.Apple now has a 96 Composite Rating, which is important. All-time winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of big runs.Microsoft cleared its own short flat base on Friday, rallying 2.55% to 86.85, just above its 86.30 entry. Volume was more than double average, which is impressive on the surface. But triple-witching expirations inflated trading activity, making it unclear if big institutions were loading up on shares.

""You have F-35s, you have AMRAAMs, and you can shoot these things down as they go up.""Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted.In particular, Northrop Grumman (NOC) has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.Tom Lawhead, head of the Air Force Joint Strike Fighter Integration Office, agrees with Hunter and told Aviation Week that the technology is feasible with the F-35. Northrop would need three years from starting integration to achieve full missile defense potential.Northrop has tested a ground-based system coupled with a radar-enabled aircraft in 2014 as a proof of concept, and Missile Defense Agency Deputy Director Rear Adm. Jon Hill told Avation Week that the F-35 along with lasers and drones are under consideration for the  Trump administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Review.Lockheed shares dipped 0.5% on the stock market today.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Boost-phase defense has been the goal of missile defense experts for decades, as existing systems are geared toward latter phases of a flight path.Raytheon's Patriot system is useful against conventional weapons and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase as well.But nuclear missiles will deliver multiple warheads and decoys making terminal defenses less effective.The Air Force has tested a laser that's mounted in a Boeing 747 — to shoot down missiles in their boost phase — but the program was canceled for being too expensive. Drones could do the same job, but analysts aren't sure the technology is mature enough.RELATED: Report Doubts Effectiveness Of Raytheon's Patriot In Recent AttackAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksRaytheon Hits Buy Zone As Romania Buys Patriot; U.S. Arms Sales SurgeThese Defense Giants Poised To Gain From New Missile Defense MovesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

114,LMT,"Canada reportedly has ditched plans to buy new Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets after a trade spat over Bombardier's (BDRBF) C Series passenger jet.X Canada was expected to buy 18 new Super Hornets from Boeing, but sources told Reuters Tuesday that Ottawa will announce plans to buy used Australian F/A-18s next week instead, as the older planes are the same model that Canada currently has in its fleet.The decision comes after the U.S. Commerce Department levied a 300% tariff on each Bombardier C Series jet delivered to the U.S., following accusations from Boeing that the Canadian industrial giant was receiving unfair government subsidies.Boeing shares were down 0.9% on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Last year, Canada announced that it would buy the F/A-18 Super Hornets as a stopgap to replace its aging CF-18 fighters until it can hold a new competition for a replacement.Canada originally planned to buy 65 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s before opening up a new competition to upgrade its fighters.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow SpaceX Could Disrupt Boeing, Airbus And The Airline Industry

115,LMT,"Boom Supersonic said it received a $10 million investment from Japan Airlines Tuesday as it looks to build a jet that could take travelers from New York to London in just over three hours, potentially zipping by commercial planes from giants Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY).X Under the deal, Japan's No. 2 carrier has the option to buy 20 aircraft and will help with aircraft design. General Electric (GE) and Honeywell International (HON) are also working on the project.Boom reportedly has 76 preorders, not including the option of 20 aircraft from Japan Airlines, for its plane that would travel at Mach 2.2, over two times the speed of sound and faster than the Concorde, which maxed out at around Mach 2. Boom's aircraft is expected to enter service in the mid-2020s.The Concorde, which was made by predecessors to BAE Systems and Airbus, was retired in 2003 in part because it wasn't able to turn a profit, and Air Lease (AL) CEO John Plueger said in June that it's hard to see airlines investing in the technology in the next 15 to 20 years due to cost concerns.By then, however, there could be room in the aviation market for even faster commercial jets.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told CNBC in June that hypersonic jets, which fly five times the speed of sound, would be commercially available in the ""next decade or two."" But he said the business case of a hypersonic jet still need to be proved.Shares of Boeing were down 0.9% at 275.54 on the stock market today, after climbing 2.4% Monday. Airbus added 0.8%, GE slipped 1.1%, and Honeywell lost 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But Boom isn't the only company looking to bring supersonic flight back.

116,LMT,"Romania is closer to a $3.9 billion deal for Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot missile-defense system amid a surge in demand for U.S. weapons overseas, helping the stock break out into buying territoryX The NATO partner signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the Patriot Wednesday after announcing plans to buy it in April.The letter allows contract negotiations between Romania and the U.S. to begin. The State Department must notify Congress of all weapons sales to foreign partners, and Congress approves any final deal.The deal would include seven Patriot Configuration 3+ units,  56 Patriot MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-TBM missiles and 168 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement missiles.The Patriot is useful against conventional weapons. It has a range of just 12 miles and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.Earlier this month the State Department approved the potential sale of four Patriot systems to Poland.Raytheon shares closed up 1.4% at 191.15 on the stock market today, clearing a 190.35 entry point. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA), which also produce missile-defense systems, rose 0.1% and 2.8%, respectively. (Lockheed also makes interceptors for the Patriot system.) Northrop Grumman (NOC), whose acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) will give it a greater presence in missile defense, added 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other defense stocks are forming new bases and are poised for breakouts as tensions rise in the Middle East, Europe and in the Pacific.Heightened global tensions have increased the demand for U.S. arms abroad. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said weapons sales in fiscal year 2017, which ended in September, rose nearly 25% to $41.93 billion.""This positive sales trend isn't surprising as the United States is the global provider of choice for Security Cooperation,"" Lt.

118,LMT,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Elon Musk's SpaceX could face new competition for military launch contracts, as Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit gets its first defense deal.XOn Thursday, Virgin Orbit won a contract from the Air Force to carry ""technology demonstration satellites"" on its LauncherOne rocket by early 2019. The LauncherOne rocket will be ""air launched"" from a modified Boeing 747 called ""Cosmic Girl.""The contract follows Branson's quiet launch earlier this month of Vox Space, a subsidiary of Virgin Orbit, that will focus on military contracts.While there is plenty of room in space, the launchpad is becoming more crowded. That's good news for the Pentagon as it looks toward increased competition and embracing new technology like reusable rockets to lower launch costs.United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed joint venture, had a monopoly on military launches until Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA) fame entered the scene with SpaceX. Defense officials have since acknowledged that the new competition from SpaceX is helping to speed up the industry and reduce costs.Boeing shares fell 0.55% at 262.26 on the stock market today. Lockheed dipped 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.In addition to satellite launches for the military, the space industry sees even bigger potential in the market for commercial satellite launches.Among the ventures in the works are competing plans to build a space-based internet using satellites in low Earth orbit, as more and more devices become connected to the internet.One such project is OneWeb, which looks to build a network for global broadband access and plans to launch the first of its 700 satellites next year. Virgin Orbit is launching satellites for OneWeb, where Branson is on the board of directors.Meanwhile, Boeing already has a plan to develop, launch and operate a constellation of 3,000 satellites in low Earth orbit and reportedly Apple (AAPL) is interested in becoming an investor-partner in the project.Last year, Musk's SpaceX filed a request with the Federal Communications Commission to launch its own constellation of 800 satellites.RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks NowHow SpaceX Could Disrupt Boeing, Airbus And The Airline IndustrySpaceX Eyes Mars While Trump Wants To Make The Moon American Again

Here are the five big takeaways from the airshow:Airbus shocked industry watchers with a $49.5 billion order for 430 A320neo and A321neo jets from U.S. investor Indigo Partners, the largest in Airbus' history.Not to be outdone, Boeing announced an order for 175 737 Max jets from discount carrier FlyDubai.Even Bombardier (BDRBF) inked an order for its struggling C Series line at the show.The show's total commitment and order tally was around 850 aircraft, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a note, as ""order activity was stronger than expected"" and the ""breadth of order activity (narrow-body and wide-body) was noteworthy.""An order for 30 A380 superjumbo jets from Emirates was widely expected at the show. But Emirates shocked the industry with an order for 40 Boeing 787-10s instead, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices.Herbert said the A380 order will likely still happen, but Emirates wants production guarantees from Airbus.But he warned that Airbus is ""reluctant to make such a commitment to a program that is facing such an uncertain future.""Emirates is the only carrier that really wants the superjumbo jets, and Herbert expects used A380s to come to the market after the leases from Emirates and Singapore expire.Boeing shares edged up 0.3% to close at 263.70 on the stock market today. Airbus slipped 0.2% to 25.15.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The Emirates Dreamliner order has pushed Boeing's 787 orders to 90 year to date, helping bolster the company's decision to boost production to 14 from 12 per month in 2019.Herbert expects Boeing to keep four to five years of Dreamliner backlog in the system and said the bump in production could be a ""substantial risk"" to the backlog if the company ""continues to book less than it is delivering.""Boeing said the Middle East will need 3,350 new airplanes over the next 20 years, valued at $730 billion, up from its 2015 market outlook of 3,180 planes.Twin-aisle planes, which are more profitable for Boeing and Airbus, are expected to make up half of new plane demand, higher than the global average.Herbert still sees ""incremental risk"" in the wide-body market, but ""improving traffic and profitability with Middle East airlines in particular is a positive.""Lockheed Martin (LMT) announced a $1.63 billion deal with the United Arab Emirates to upgrade its 80 F-16 fighter jets.The UAE is also interested in fifth-generation fighters like Lockheed's stealthy F-35, according to Reuters.

127,LMT,"The American public's first sign that space warfare is being waged won't be giant explosions lighting up the sky or X-Wing fighters crashing to the ground. Instead, everyday conveniences that we take for granted would be disrupted, such as ATMs and streaming videos.X But the world's most powerful military could be crippled if an enemy destroyed or disabled critical space infrastructure as part of a space war. Navigation, guided missiles and missile-warning alerts rely on GPS satellites. Critical intelligence comes from spy satellites. Drones, Navy ships and infantry grunts use communications satellites. And the disruption of your mundane comforts, which increasingly rely on satellite communications, eventually could grind daily life to a halt.""Our entire global economy and our way of life (are) enabled by space capabilities,"" said Col. Shawn Fairhurst, deputy director at Air Force Space Command.Despite the success of American companies like SpaceX in the new space race, the U.S. is more vulnerable than ever to war in space. Russia and China are ramping up their offensive potential. And while the effects of space warfare on worldwide commerce would hurt the U.S. and its adversaries alike, the U.S. military's unmatched global footprint and forward-deployed posture mean it is especially dependent on space-based assets.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  So what was once a key enabler of U.S. dominance – famously on display during the first Gulf War when precision weapons and space-based imaging left the world awe-struck – is becoming a channel that adversaries can exploit to gain the upper hand.Russia and China ""are building those capabilities to challenge the United States of America, to challenge our allies and to change the balance of power in the world,"" Gen. John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in December. ""We cannot allow that to happen.""On Feb. 21, Susan Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, warned that China and Russia have laser weapons designed to damage space-based sensors. Two days later, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein predicted that it will only be ""a matter of years"" before space warfare is waged.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAmid the growing alarm about a war in space, the Pentagon plans to pour more money into space capabilities. Companies like Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) — which make rockets, satellites and other space assets — are poised to receive those dollars.Space was once seen as a sanctuary from military activity, even as it served as a stage for Cold War bragging rights. The Outer Space Treaty, enacted in 1967, outlaws the use of nuclear weapons in space and prohibits testing weapons or building military bases on the moon or other celestial bodies. Since then, satellites have enveloped the planet, while the International Space Station has been maintained as a sign of global scientific cooperation.But China and Russia have made no secret of their space warfare ambitions and could have anti-satellite weapons ready for combat in the next few years, according to the latest threat assessment report from the U.S. intelligence community, released Feb. 13.The threat has been growing for years. In 2007, China shocked the world when it fired a ground-based missile to destroy an old weather satellite in what was widely seen as a test of an anti-satellite system.Last month's U.S. intelligence report said China has been training with such ground-based anti-satellite missiles, and Russia is developing similar technology.Blowing up a satellite carries risks for the attacker, as it would create a massive debris field of perhaps 10,000 pieces and could put its own satellites in jeopardy too.But the intelligence report noted less blunt methods, such as Russia's ""experiment satellites"" now in orbit. These satellites have official missions like inspection, refueling and repair, but could be turned into weapons that stop short of destroying their targets.China has a satellite with an extendable robotic arm that it says can be used to collect space junk but likely can also be used to cripple working satellites. And Russia reportedly has highly maneuverable satellites secretly launched into orbit in 2015 that can be used to bump into other satellites.The U.S. isn't helpless. It has potentially dual-use technology that could be given offensive missions too. Satellites that can dock with existing satellites to refuel them could be turned into weapons by ordering them to bump enemy satellites out of orbit or equipping them with jammers or lasers, says Theresa Hitchens, senior research associate at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies. China has been working on similar technology.Northrop also provides anti-jamming capabilities but warns that ""only a very small amount of defense satellite communications are secure and protected against intercept and jamming threats."" The company declined to provide additional information about its anti-jamming and other defense capabilities for military or commercial satellites.Besides active defenses, the U.S. can make individual satellites less appealing as targets during a war in space.One way would be building large satellites used by many nations, so any attack would be seen as aggression against a potential coalition. Another way would be to develop more maneuverable satellites that could avoid collisions from other satellites, missiles or space debris.The military is also looking at deploying greater quantities of smaller satellites that spread out capabilities, instead of the current model of building large satellites that make ""juicy targets,"" according to Hyten.The U.S. can employ ground-based jammers, but they are only effective when the targeted satellite is in range. Lasers could also be used to temporarily blind or permanently disable a satellite, but the technology isn't mature enough yet to be effective against a large satellite.The bottom line is that the U.S. has much more to lose in space combat than its adversaries do.""We don't have good options for fighting back because this is an asymmetrical situation,"" as potential adversaries aren't as reliant on space systems, Hitchens said. ""It's not a tit-for-tat thing like it is for nuclear weapons.""Policymakers are aware of the threat and are working to address it. The National Defense Strategy released in January emphasized the need to ""prioritize investments in resilience, reconstitution, and operations to assure our space capabilities"" as ""attacks against our critical defense, government, and economic infrastructure must be anticipated.""In its fiscal 2019 budget request, the Air Force is seeking an 8% increase in space funding, the second straight year of significant increases to the space portfolio. The budget focuses on building more jam-resistant GPS satellites, while improving systems for missile warnings and situational awareness in space.Perhaps just as important as more funding and hardware is figuring out what kind of response an attack would merit. With no established norms of space warfare, it may be difficult to prevent an attack from spiraling out of control.For example, China could use an anti-satellite missile as a warning shot to tell the U.S. to back down and de-escalate a situation, Hitchens says. But the result could be the exact opposite. The U.S. could see the move as a sign of aggression and attack the missile's launch site, escalating the situation into an attack on the Chinese homeland.Another wrinkle is the fast-growing commercial space industry, with SpaceX showing it can deliver large military and spy satellites via its new Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX, Boeing and OneWeb are among the numerous companies with plans to launch thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit in the coming years.The new constellations about to enter space would provide space-based internet services as well as surveillance and tracking. Such capabilities are useful to companies that want to keep tabs on shipping fleets, but in theory they could help the military too.""If a commercial system is being deliberately used to provide the military with capabilities, in the time of war it's a legitimate target,"" Hitchens said.So what happens if China and Russia use their space assets on a commercial satellite? Is that an act of war?""That is a policy issue that is being actively discussed,"" said Stephen Flanagan, a senior political analyst at Rand Corp.While outer space is itself a vacuum, any fight there won't happen in a vacuum.Fairhurst says a war won't likely start in space. Instead, wars that start on the ground or at sea would extend into space.So options range from economic sanctions to a proportional response in a different domain, like an air- or ground-based attack.""We aren't locked into an answer,"" Fairhurst said. ""But the bottom line is that as a nation we have a right to defend ourselves if attacked. And just because we are attacked in space doesn't mean we have to respond in space.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing And Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIn This Space Race, Here's Where SpaceX May Not Come In First

The 10-year Treasury hit 3% for the first time in four years, hitting 3.02% during the week before pulling back to 2.96%. Short-term yields continued to rise faster than long-term rates, squeezing the yield spread. Alphabet (GOOGL) expenses and ongoing chip weakness also hit stocks. But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion. The company raised its 2018 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance.

U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $69 a barrel, the highest level since late 2014, but traded little changed for the week.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) beat quarterly estimates. Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

Vertex said it'll move another triple-pill regimen into Phase 3 studies.Domino's (DPZ) delivered a 59% EPS gain while revenue leapt 26% to $785 million, blowing out views. Shares rose 7.3% on Thursday. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock vaulted 24% to a 10-month high after EPS unexpectedly jumped 33%. Same-store sales also topped. Starbucks (SBUX) was on par on earnings with an 18% EPS rise to 53 cents, though a 14% rise on sales to $6.03 billion outdid analyst predictions.New Oriental Education (EDU) earned 67 cents per share as revenue grew to $618 million. Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates. Fifty-two customers now spend over $5 million annually, a metric that is up 108% year over year.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) topped sales and adjusted profit views, but shares tanked as sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements lagged.Illumina (ILMN) beat the consensus. Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations. Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

133,LMT,"Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) were given big price-target hikes Monday due to an expected free cash flow boom.X Strong demand for commercial jets, expected future defense spending hikes, tax cuts, and international demand for U.S. military equipment factor into the sunny outlooks.Berenberg Bank maintained a buy position and raised the price target on Boeing to 415 from 395 citing ""strong business momentum"" in a research note to investors.Analysts estimated that free cash flow (FCF) will rocket to $16.4 billion by 2020 and $18 billion by 2022, marking a 35% jump from 2017's $13.3 billion total. Part of that is the cut in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%: Boeing was on track to generate nearly $12 billion of cash for 2017 before the tax reform.But Berenberg also noted improvements in volume, mix and productivity, which led analysts to raise their forecast for cash generation by around $1.5 billion per year.""Boeing's highly visible revenue from a large commercial aerospace backlog and contracted defense programs and service activities support sustained organic growth over the coming years,"" the note said. ""The longer-term outlook for defense has improved given rising global tensions and President Trump's plans to increase spending in revenue terms.""Risks included a significant slowdown in commercial aerospace orders, the cost impact of the launch of a new aircraft program, and the company failing to win the contract for the U.S. Air Force T-X trainer.In 2017, Boeing delivered a record 763 airliners and forecast this will rise to between 810 and 815 planes this year. The 737 is doing well and the company is even speeding up production of the 787 Dreamliner, which had long been a drain on resources, as it tries to capitalize on a favorable market.The company racked up almost $30 billion in losses building the first 500 Dreamliners, but has been manufacturing them at a profit since 2016. It is expected the profitability of the aircraft's production will rise even further in coming years, offsetting the previously incurred losses.Shares of aerospace giant Boeing closed down 5.7% at 328.88 and Lockheed Martin, which is the world's largest defense contractor, sank 4.6% to 336.46 on the stock market today, amid a broad market meltdown.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Meanwhile Lockheed Martin was given a price target rise to 403 from 348 Monday by the Buckingham Research Group, which holds a buy position on the stock.In a research note, analyst higher Richard Safran said he expects free cash flow increases to come from ""higher than expected U.S. defense spending and increasing international demand for U.S. defense equipment.""Safran also said investors are underestimating the strength and duration of the current defense spending cycle. The note came on the same day reports emerged saying that the Pentagon is to ask Congress to approve the purchase of 77 of Lockheed's F-35 jets for $10.7 billion. The proposal is expected to be included as part of a fiscal 2019 base defense budget plan that will cost around $597 billion.He was also positive about the effects tax reform will have going forward.""In our view, the Trump administration philosophically believes that cash generated by companies is better spent by companies than by the Government,"" Safran said in his research note. ""We think this represents a fundamental shift in policy relative to prior administrations.""The analyst said that aside from typical risks with exposure to government spending, the primary risks for Lockheed Martin are program execution, shifting discretionary spending priorities and pension liability.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED INBoeing Mulls Canadian Fighter Jet Bid Despite Bombardier SpatBoeing Gets $6.6 Billion From Pentagon To Expand Missile Defense Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

134,LMT,"Friday proved to be an unusual session as growth-style stocks and income-type utilities rallied nearly in lockstep amid a broad late-afternoon advance in the stock market today.XMeanwhile, members of the aerospace and defense industry group continue to have a hot start in 2018. IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry group has vaulted 6.7% year to date, vs. a less than 2% gain for the S&P 500, amid news reported by IBD that the Air Force is rushing to build a next-generation fighter jet.Lockheed Martin (LMT), which found nice support at the rising 50-day moving average during the fast slide in stocks in early February, gained 0.5% to 357.34. That extends the military jet and warfare systems giant's advance from a breakout past an eight-week flat base at 322.29 to nearly 11%.Lockheed pays a quarterly cash dividend of $2 per share, giving the stock an annualized yield of 2.3%. That's better than the 1.7% yield for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, at least 10 additional companies in the same industry group hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, including Teledyne Tech (TDY), Heico (HEI), Curtiss-Wright (CW), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit Aerosystems (SPR), Huntington Ingalls (HII), General Dynamics (GD) and KLX (KLXI).You can compare all of the IBD Ratings of each of these stocks with peers in the same industry group by using Stock Checkup to speed your fundamental analysis. Focus on those with rising relative strength lines, which are painted in blue in all IBD charts. A fast-rising RS line means a stock is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.At 3 p.m. ET, the Dow utility average shot more than 2.2% higher, beating gains of 1.3% to 1.5% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% as 12 of the 30 components rallied 1 point or more.The Dow utilities group is a big laggard so far in 2018, falling as much as 17% below its December peak of 778. Yet these dividend-rich defensive plays are getting relief from reports that members of the Federal Reserve's FOMC policy board are hinting at a continued ""go slow"" approach toward raising the cost of money.While a quarter-point hike in the short-term fed funds rate is likely in the bag during next month's meeting on interest rates, futures traders still see less than a 40% chance that, by year's end, the Fed would raise the fed funds rate by more than three times. The current target range is 1.25%-1.5%, and the majority of futures traders tracked by CME Group see the range rising to 2%-2.25%.That rate would still be much lower than the expected 12-month forward earnings yield of the S&P 500, which is around 5% to 5.5%, depending on which Wall Street investment strategist you trust.Meanwhile, investors bought back long-term bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged down to 2.88%. Earlier in the week, the yield hit as high as 2.95%, creeping closer to the January 2014 peak of 3.04%, a key psychological level for institutional investors.Going back to the military supplier group, Huntington Ingalls recently broke out of a three-month flat base with a 253.54 buy point. The 5% buy zone goes up to 266.22.Notice on the submarine and Navy class destroyer builder's daily chart that Huntington's relative strength line has ascended into new high ground, a bullish sign.KLX is finding buying support at the 50-day moving average for the second time since its breakout from a cup-shaped base at 54.50 on Oct. 3.The first and second pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week line can offer a timely entry to establish a new position in a leading stock or to add a small amount of shares to a winning core position.Among the FAANG stocks, Google search engine operator Alphabet (GOOGL) looked poised to finish a second straight week up. The internet content titan is up just 0.5% to 1,115.40, but Friday's advance is the eighth in 10 sessions. The stock is also up more than 2.5% for the week.Like the Nasdaq itself, Alphabet has turned in an impressive rebound after tickling its 200-day moving average Feb. 9.See on a daily chart how the megacap tech ($775 billion in market value, which is share price times shares outstanding) bounced sharply off its intraday low on Feb. 9, then finished up big in whale-like volume. That's bullish.For now, Alphabet is in a new base, less than 7% below its all-time peak of 1,197. The recent correction of 17% from head to toe is too deep to be a potential flat base. The correction is also too narrow in time to serve as a cup or a cup with handle. So keep watching.Also keep an eye on Alphabet's proprietary ratings.The Relative Price Strength Rating is not great, but at 78 on IBD Stock Checkup it's decent for a mature large cap. The very best growth companies tend to show an RS Rating in the high 80s or more. However, Alphabet, for now, should be viewed as a potential new big cap leader.Alphabet's Composite Rating is grand at 98.Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied more than 6% to 17.82 following positive reports that South Korea in fact may allow certain types of transactions in digital currencies. However, as noted frequently in IBD's Stock Market Today columns, the closed end fund has a very long way to go before forming a legitimate new base and staging a potential new breakout point.Universal Display (OLED) got hammered again, falling 15% to 131 in massive volume. The expert in organic light-emitting diodes for TVs and smartphone displays reported stout earnings growth, up 69%, as revenue jumped 55% to $115.9 million.However, the former stock market leader had already triggered two key sell signals: 1) Universal slammed beneath its 50-day moving average in huge trade on Jan. 24-25; and 2) the stock triggered the golden rule of investing as it slid 8% below the most recent late-stage base buy point of 192.85.In other markets, the persistent rise in crude oil seems to confirm the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar as well as optimism over the global economy, not just OPEC's continued willingness to limit its production.WTI near-term futures rose 1.3% to $63.58 a barrel, marking a three-week high. The year-to-date high for WTI is $66.14, last seen in late January.

The stock cleared the 118.38 buy point of a lopsided flat base in heavy trading. The relative strength line is near a new high as well.On Feb. 8, VeriSign reported results that lifted the stock off three-month lows and continued into Friday's move to new highs.

136,LMT,"THE PENTAGON — The Air Force is canceling a recapitalization of its airborne command and surveillance aircraft, budget documents showed Monday, and plans to retire newer bombers but keep the Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s flying.X The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System is not funded in the 2019 presidential budget, two days after Defense News reported that the Air Force is canceling the JSTARS program in favor of linking systems together to perform the same tasks.""It's got to be survivable, that is the key. If we recap current JSTARS we have an aircraft that does what it does now,"" Air Force Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Maj. Gen. John Pletcher, told reporters. ""It's probably  able to do less because we'll be in a more competitive, contested environment.""Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were leading teams with bids for the $7 billion new aircraft program to replace the current fleet of Northrop  E-8s.The service is unsure what the new family of platforms might look like. Pletcher said it could include putting current sensors on drones like the MQ-9 Reaper or other assets in space or on the ground.The cancellation of the JSTARS recap wasn't a surprise as the Air Force has been critical of the platform since last fall.In November, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said the current system of one large plane with a radar system on its belly meets less than 5% of a combatant commander's requirements. But the JSTARS replacement, also envisioned as a large plane, would meet less than 1% of requirements under current threats.This came after Defense Secretary James Mattis said in September that he has talked to the Air Force chief of staff about ""new ways"" to perform a key airborne command and control ""mission.""""Boeing understands the U.S. Air Force has many competing priorities to address within the budget,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force as it defines its path forward.""Boeing, a Dow Jones component, rose 3.3% on the stock market today. Lockheed advanced 1.3%, and Northrop Grumman gained 1.4%.

But rather than step away completely, it's more important than ever for investors to stay in step with the market.

""We will also continue necessary B-1 and B-2 modifications to keep them relevant until the B-21s come on line.""The decision to keep the older B-52 and not the newer B-1s and B-2s was due to maintenance, total cost and mission capability, according to the Air Force's statement.Overall, the 2019 presidential budget's $686 billion defense spending plan would also give troops a 2.6% pay raise and add 16,400 service members to the ranks.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThese 5 Defense Contractors Stand Out In Stock Market Correction

137,LMT,"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket successfully lifted off Tuesday, just minutes before the launch window closed for the day, with the side boosters also separating as planned and the second stage entering orbit.X The two side boosters landed safely at Cape Canaveral minutes later, generating six sonic booms between them. But the center booster missed the autonomous spaceport drone ship ""Of Course I Still Love You,"" hitting the water at 300 miles per hour about 100 meters away and taking out two engines on the ship with a shower of shrapnel, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said at a post-launch press briefing.Earlier, Musk tweeted that the upper stage was restarting and will attempt a ""final burn for Mars"" after traveling for five hours through the Earth's Van Allen radiation belt, where the spacecraft will get ""zapped.""Upper stage restart nominal, apogee raised to 7000 km. Will spend 5 hours getting zapped in Van Allen belts & then attempt final burn for Mars.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 6, 2018The Falcon Heavy's successful maiden flight marks a major step forward for the private-sector space company, after years of delays and an estimated $1 billion to develop the rocket. At Tuesday evening's briefing, Musk said the investment to date in the Falcon Heavy is more than he would like to admit, ""over half a billion or more,"" adding that SpaceX tried to cancel the program three times because ""this is harder than we thought.""The launch window opened at 1:30 p.m. ET Tuesday but had been pushed back several times due to weather. Liftoff took place at the Kennedy Space Center's Space Launch Complex 39A, where Apollo 11 took off in 1969 on its way to the moon.The massive Falcon Heavy is 230 feet tall and consists of three Falcon 9 first-stage cores. Thrust from its 27 engines is equivalent to 18 Boeing (BA) 747s, making it two times more powerful than any other rocket operating today, according to SpaceX.Today's payload was a red Tesla (TSLA) Roadster playing David Bowie's ""Life on Mars"" on its way to deep space traveling along an elliptical Mars orbit.SpaceX has a rapid timeline for the next mission. On Monday, Musk told reporters that a successful test flight could set up the Falcon Heavy's first commercial launch for a paying customer just three to six months later.SpaceX has said it plans to use the rocket to launch an Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed Martin (LMT) sometime early this year. The Falcon Heavy also will be used in the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites.Despite the failure of the center stage to land safely, the launch appeared to be a success on different levels. On Monday, Musk said just clearing the launchpad would be a big ""win,"" noting that the three core boosters faced the risk of impacting each other due to shaking during launch.Separation of the two side boosters was also a big milestone as the separation system hadn't been tested in flight before. Musk also warned that supersonic shock waves from flight could cause structural failure.IBD'S TAKE: A new space age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  The Falcon Heavy has double the payload capacity of the current top dog, the Delta IV Heavy made by the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.But there are doubts about how much demand there is for that kind of payload capacity, given that potential commercial and government customers are increasingly looking at smaller satellites.The Pentagon, for example, may choose to rely on bigger constellations of smaller satellites to build in redundancy and reduce vulnerability to attack or failure.On Tuesday, Musk said the Falcon Heavy will ""open up a new class of payloads. (It's) up to customers what they might want to launch. Can launch things right to Pluto and beyond. Launch giant satellites. It can do anything you want.""The Falcon Heavy's prospects for crewed missions, including space tourism flights around the moon, look less certain as well.On Monday, Musk said a separate, even more powerful rocket dubbed the ""BFR"" has seen its development progress faster than anticipated. That means it may not be necessary for SpaceX to qualify both the Falcon Heavy and BFR for crewed flights and instead just qualify the BFR.On Tuesday, Musk said the success of the Falcon Heavy gives him ""confidence BFR is really quiet workable,"" adding that the BFR is better suited to taking people to the moon. In fact, engineering resources will be focused on the BFR, and no major design updates are planned for the Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy.Meanwhile, Boeing is developing another heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), for NASA and could see its first flight at the end of 2019.But by reusing boosters, SpaceX estimates each Falcon Heavy mission will cost about $100 million, just one fourth the cost of nearest heavy-lift rival and a tenth of the estimated $1 billion per-mission cost of the SLS.Still, Musk sees new entrants in the space market, saying he hopes the success of the Falcon Heavy, which was funded by SpaceX itself, will ""encourage other companies and countries to raise their sights.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksSpaceX, Boeing To Take This Giant Leap For Space Industry In 2018

""China is dependent on the aircraft capacity to support its economic growth, and there is a lack of alternatives available for China if it were to limit imports from Boeing, for example.

139,LMT,"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — After nailing its maiden flight Tuesday, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy showed off a satellite-insertion technique for the Air Force, positioning itself for future military launches in a small but potentially lucrative market.X The rocket, which launched a Tesla (TSLA) Roadster and a mannequin wearing SpaceX's new spacesuit, demonstrated a new maneuver that showed SpaceX can directly insert a payload into its final orbit, according to Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project and the director of Defense Budget Analysis at CSIS.Normally, a satellite first goes into a geosynchronous transfer orbit and then employs what's called an apogee kick motor that positions the satellite in its final orbit.But SpaceX showed that its second-stage booster can restart the engine six hours into flight and perform this final maneuver without the payload relying on a separate, onboard motor, which takes up additional space and requires fuel.""It could save a significant amount of mass on the satellite and ultimately that means you can put more equipment on (the satellite) or make the satellite smaller so maybe you can launch two or three at a time,"" Harrison said.Demonstrating that capability to the Air Force is key as SpaceX looks to line up customers for the Falcon Heavy, which is the world's most powerful rocket, with double the payload capacity of the next-closest rival. The market potential for that kind of lift is fuzzy, given that companies and governments are increasingly looking at smaller satellites for future constellations.But the market for military launches, while relatively small, is lucrative, Harrison said. Once the Falcon Heavy gets certified, SpaceX can start bidding on launches of some of the most expensive and classified satellites.In particular, spy satellites equipped with telescopes that provide high-resolution imagery as well as antenna arrays for signals intelligence require heavy-lift rockets. And while the Pentagon also plans to rely on smaller satellites, they won't have the same capabilities as the large ones.""There are some missions that DOD still needs to launch heavy payloads,"" Harrison said. ""I think the smaller satellites are a way of adding resiliency by providing similar but not the entirely exact same capabilities to complement larger satellites, not to replace them.""Harrison estimated that SpaceX might only have two to three heavy-lift missions a year for the military, but the Air Force values having a second launch option and would be willing to pay up.Currently, United Launch Alliance, a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, has the only heavy-payload, Defense Department-certified rocket. But the military is supposed to maintain two independent launch vehicles for all types of payloads.Harrison also said NASA could be a potential Falcon Heavy customer, and commercial firms could use it to launch multiple satellites at the same time.Boeing shares rose 2.1% to finish at 348.12 on the stock market today. Lockheed rallied 2.3%.IBD'S TAKE: A new space age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  SpaceX has said the first Falcon Heavy launch for a paying customer could come three to six months after the maiden flight. Three commercial customers are already lined up, including satellite operators Arabsat, Inmarsat and Viasat.The Air Force also plans to use the Falcon Heavy in its Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites. But the rocket must go through certification.The Falcon Heavy contains many of the same components found on its small brother, the Falcon 9, and Harrison thinks the Air Force's certification process won't be as intense for the Falcon Heavy. The Air Force also will probably wait for three successful commercial launches before providing certification for a military payload.Meanwhile, the Tesla Roadster and its mannequin passenger appear to have missed a planned trajectory for an elliptical Mars orbit and is instead headed for the asteroid belt.A final burn, which may have been visible over Los Angeles last night, was more powerful than expected.I think this is probably Starman heading out to solar orbit https://t.co/1jX9PR3xqQ— Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) February 7, 2018 Third burn successful. Exceeded Mars orbit and kept going to the Asteroid Belt. pic.twitter.com/bKhRN73WHF— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 7, 2018President Trump and Vice President Pence tweeted congratulations to SpaceX on the successful launch as Washington looks to return to the moon.But Musk said Tuesday that he wouldn't recommend using the Falcon Heavy for crewed moon missions. Instead, an even more powerful rocket dubbed the ""BFR"" that is currently making faster-than-expected development progress would be better suited, he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks

141,LMT,"Low oil prices and political tensions with Qatar are expected to make the Dubai Airshow less influential than in prior years.XThe biannual show, running Sunday through Thursday, will feature aircraft from Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY), Bombardier (BDRBF), General Dynamics (GD) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Oil prices have rebounded off lows but are still down by half from their peak three years ago, and governments in the Middle East have tightened their purse strings after going on a buying spree a few years ago.Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly, said Etihad in particular is in trouble, noting that the carrier ""wasted a lot of  money buying stakes in hopeless airlines elsewhere,"" such as now-defunct Air Berlin and Italy's bankrupt Alitalia.""It's always been the more marginal airline,"" Kaplan said of Abu Dhabi-based Etihad. ""Even Emirates is under more pressure than it's accustomed to. But Dubai is at least a sizable local market; Abu Dhabi is much smaller.""One potential order to watch is a 20-plane deal for the A380 from Emirates, which Bloomberg reported is in talks with Airbus. But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, said delivery time lines are key, as Emirates last year pushed back the delivery of 12 jets.""No one else wants this plane,"" he said.Low-cost Gulf carriers, however, are faring better than their larger peers, and Kaplan said Flydubai could order some narrowbody jets, noting that single-aisle demand has been stronger vs. twin-aisle overall.Meanwhile, Bombardier is bringing a C Series 300 for display, just weeks after Airbus took a majority stake in the struggling narrowbody business. Any new C Series orders would put pressure on Boeing as it considers building a middle-of-the-market plane.Boeing sees a ""pretty significant"" market opportunity and is ""really getting deep"" into further discussions with more than 50 customers, CFO Greg Smith told analysts at Baird's Global Industrial Conference Wednesday.Business jet orders could be big at the show as lower oil prices have helped boost private air travel,  said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial. That could help General Dynamics' Gulfstream corporate-jet business.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.On the defense side, Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN) and others will show off their wares, with the Pentagon putting Lockheed's F-22 and F-16 on display.Missile defense orders from the region are rising as tensions heat up with Iran. Last month, Lockheed said Saudi Arabia ""seems intent on moving quickly"" with its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense order.Regional conflicts have kept defense spending up, despite low oil prices, Aboulafia said, particularly for precision weapons, which are seeing heavy use.Aboulafia also wonders if the United Arab Emirates will order Eurofighter's Typhoon, Dassault's Rafale or Boeing's Super Hornet as a stopgap before it can get U.S. authorization to buy the more advanced F-35 from Lockheed in the next five years. Aircraft with intelligence and surveillance capabilities will also be in demand, he added.But all defense orders are government to government and need approval from the State Department and Congress.Shares of Boeing fell 1.1% in the stock market today.

142,LMT,"A couple of top-performing defense and aerospace ETFs have strikingly similar charts, yet their portfolios are significantly different.X SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) and iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) are both forming flat bases and are near buy points. SPDR Aerospace's chart shows a potential buy point at 83.05, while iShares Aerospace & Defense has a buy point at 184.70. It edged above that level Thursday but fell below it Friday in the general market sell-off.Both ETFs share the industry titans such as Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN). The two funds have about 35 stocks each, but the portfolios are structured differently.SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense is an equal-weighted index in which small caps such as aircraft components maker Triumph Group (TGI) and rocket builder Orbital ATK (OA) have as much weighting as Northrop and Boeing, with market capitalization of $53 billion and $160 billion, respectively.IBD's TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.By comparison, iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF uses the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace and Defense Index, in which Boeing has 10.5% of the weighting and Triumph Group only about 1%. The eight smallest components account for less than 1% each.Regardless of structure, the two ETFs have performed in a remarkably similar manner. Both have five-year average annual gains of about 24%, three-year average gains of about 18% (through Oct. 31) and year-to-date gains of around 30%.Most of the major defense stocks have performed quite well in 2017, and are trading near all-time highs.Defense stocks usually perform well even in times of peace, because defense spending rarely drops. This year, operations in Syria and Iraq against ISIS are winding down, but North Korea's fast-moving missile program poses new security threats for the U.S. and its allies. U.S. forces remain in battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan.Lockheed builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon builds the Patriot missile defense system. President Trump is seeking an additional $4 billion for missile defense programs amid rising tensions with North Korea.Commercial aviation is another major factor in these ETFs, and that business continues to roll on rising orders for more-efficient jetliners, a trend reinforced in this month's Dubai air show.""The order strength, and positive headlines against more modest expectations, at the Dubai airshow provide additional evidence of the strength in the commercial (plane) cycle,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Ken Herbert and Jamaine Aggrey wrote in a report. ""We continue to see incremental risk on the wide-body outlook, but improving traffic and profitability with Middle East airlines"" in particular are positives.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

143,LMT,"It will cost more than a trillion dollars to improve America's nuclear forces, according to a new estimate, but analysts argue that the Pentagon can get by with less.XThe Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday put the price tag at $1.2 trillion dollars through 2046, just 6% of total defense spending over 30 years but 20% higher than its estimate three years ago. The bill includes about $800 billion to make incremental upgrades to existing weapons near the end of their usable life spans, and about $400 billion for modernization efforts like the new Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bomber.The total figure is actually $1.7 trillion with inflation included, noted Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.In addition to the B-21, the Pentagon has already award initial contracts to other defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) for everything from nuclear-armed missiles to nuclear-armed submarines.The massive cost estimate for the nuclear force comes as the Defense Department faces other big-ticket priorities such as Lockheed's F-35 and pushing the Navy's fleet back above 300 ships.But the bill doesn't have to be that high for taxpayers and the CBO offered suggestions on how to lower costs. Here are some:America's nuclear force has for decades been based on the triad of land-, air- and sea-based weapons. But getting rid of the land-based ICBM leg, would save $120 billion though 2046. Of that, roughly $90 billion would come from canceling a replacement program. In August, the Air Force awarded Boeing and Northrop preliminary design phase contracts for it.Former Defense Secretary William Perry and retired Gen. James Cartwright, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs, wrote a letter to President Trump on behalf of the Ploughshares Fund, arguing that ICBMs create instability and increase the possibility of accidental nuclear war.""Our ICBMs are in danger of being launched in the case of another false alarm (we have experienced three to date), thereby starting a civilization-ending nuclear war by accident.""But during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis backed the development of new ICBMs.Perry and Cartwright support the building of ""an appropriate number of new, nuclear-armed submarines as the most survivable leg of the deterrent"" and new bombers that also have conventional applications.Going without the new  Long Range Standoff weapon would save $28 billion through 2046. Last month, the Air Force also awarded Lockheed and Raytheon preliminary design phase contracts for the LRSO.While CBO warned the lack of cruise missiles ""would diminish the capability of U.S. nuclear forces, particularly for limited nuclear strikes,"" Collina said the LRSO creates more instability as Russia can't tell if the air-launched missiles are nuclear or conventional and could spark a nuclear response to a conventional weapon.""Have conventional weapons  do the job instead,"" he suggested. ""We have conventional cruise missiles that can take out air defenses. We don't have to use nuclear missiles.""IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The Defense Department is currently reassessing its nuclear strategy as part of its Nuclear Posture Review, which will be sent to the White House by the end of the year.Collina noted that the U.S. can still maintain plenty of bang for fewer bucks.""The core of our power are conventional forces that can be deployed and project power around the world,"" he said. ""We can still be a nuclear power and have way fewer nuclear weapons than we have today.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 258.50 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Lockheed fell 0.5%, just below buy zone, Raytheon edged up less than 0.1%, Northrop lost 0.45% and General Dynamics eased 0.7%.RELATED:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

144,LMT,"Boeing's (BA) KC-46 Air Force refueling tanker continues to rack up more expenses, the aerospace giant revealed Wednesday, weighing on an otherwise positive third-quarter report.XThe commercial unit saw additional KC-46 costs of $256 million in Q3, and the defense unit booked another $73 million during the quarter. Under a fixed-cost contract with the Pentagon, Boeing is on the hook for any cost overruns, which now total $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes.The latest charges are due to changes to initial production aircraft as late testing continues, and not to ""new significant technical discoveries,"" said CEO Dennis Muilenberg on a conference call.He added that the tanker, which is based on a Boeing 767 airframe, has been performing well in flight tests, and described issues with the tanker's refueling boom as normal.The challenges that have been arising recently are related to getting the aircraft up to certification standards. And as the company puts the finishing touches on the tanker, it is concurrently producing them.""We still have some items to work though on how we do concurrency and how we do it efficiently,"" Muilenberg said.Early this year, Boeing CFO Greg Smith said the tanker had largely gotten past its development issues, leaving ""just factory work,"" though flight testing remained.Despite the KC-46's additional costs, management boosted Boeing's overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion, led by improved performance.The company also raised its full-year core EPS outlook to $9.90-$10.10 from a prior view of $9.80-$10.00, driven by a lower tax rate, though the midpoint is still below the consensus estimate of $10.06 and implied Q4 EPS is $2.62-$2.82, below views for $2.96.In Q3, core earnings per share dropped 22.5% to $2.72, but topped forecasts for $2.65, while revenue edged up 1.7% to $24.31 billion, above estimates for $24.06 billion, as Boeing said earlier commercial aircraft deliveries rose 7.4% to 202 during the quarter.Commercial aircraft revenue fell 1% to $14.98 billion. Defense, space and security revenue dropped 5% to $5.47 billion. Global services revenue grew 2% to $3.57 billion. Backlog slipped to $474 billion at the end of Q3 from $482 billion at the start of Q3.Shares sank 2.85% to 258.42 on the stock market today, putting Boeing back in the top of its buy range after breaking out from a 246.59 entry last month. European rival Airbus (EADSY) edged up 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Boeing's defense unit also faces the risk of losing a chance to sell F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets to Canada amid a trade dispute over Bombardier's C Series jet. But Muilenberg dismissed the political tension, saying the relationship with the U.K, and Canada will outlast this trade issue.The Commerce Department's 300% tariff on the C Series, which Boeing complained was receiving illegal state aid, was also seen as a factor in Airbus taking a majority stake in the C Series program, potentially expanding Airbus' offerings in the narrowbody market and putting pressure on Boeing to launch a mid-market plane.On Wednesday, Boeing said the Airbus-Bombardier deal hasn't affected its strategy and reiterated that it is still reviewing a decision on a new plane.RELATED: Northrop Raises Outlook After Surprise Q3 Earnings Gain; General Dynamics MixedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

"
146,LMT,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) said Wednesday that it would not submit a bid for the Navy's unmanned tanker competition, despite being seen as a major player in the contest.XWe ""made a decision not to bid MQ-25 based on the particular nature of that"" request for proposal, CEO Wes Bush said during the company's Q3 earnings call.The Navy released an official request for proposal for the MQ-25A earlier this month and now the competition is down to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), and General Atomics. A final contact is expected next year. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.Northrop, whose Global Hawk helped earn the company prominence in drone technology, was expected to be a formidable bidder for the Navy drone, as its X-47B prototype had been used in Navy technology demonstrations, which even included takeoff and landing operations from an aircraft carrier.But the Navy has scaled back its drone program from its original inception as a strike and surveillance aircraft, with its mission now targeted for aerial refueling.Bush said the decision not to bid wasn't just about winning the contract but looking at the ability to meet all of the requirements. But ""broadly things are going really well"" for the company's unmanned systems, he said, adding that the MQ-4C Triton unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone is moving along.Northrop shares jumped 3.7% to close at a record high of 304.75 on the stock market today.Northrop's Q3 earnings rose 10% to $3.68 while sales rose 6% to $6.53 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.92 with revenue of $6.32 billion.Aerospace Systems unit sales rose 11% to $3.1 billion on higher F/A-18 Super Hornet and other manned aircraft sales, including a restricted manned aircraft, which is likely company's secretive B-21 bomber. Mission system sales rose 5% on higher sensor sales for the F-35.Northrop makes the F/A-18's aft/center fuselage section and vertical tails and is also a major subcontractor on Lockheed's F-35.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $12.90-$13.10 from a prior guidance of $12.10-$12.40. It now sees 2017 sales of $25.5 billion from a prior outlook of $25 billion. The new forecasts are bullish vs. consensus views for EPS of $12.91 on revenue of $12.59 billion.Management also said its acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) for $9.2 billion will add to Northrop's earnings no later than first full year after the acquisition closes sometime in the first half of 2018.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.General Dynamics (GD) and Boeing also announced Q3 results Wednesday.General Dynamics saw a 7% increase in EPS to $2.52 but revenue dipped 1% to $7.58 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $2.43 on revenue of $7.43. Backlog was $63.9 billion, up 9.2%.Boeing's results beat Wall Street estimates but the company recorded another charge on its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force.General Dynamics shares fell 2.3%, and Boeing lost 2.85%.Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for Thursday.Lockheed Martin reported Q3 results that fell short of analyst expectations Tuesday but raised its full year EPS outlook.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingBoeing Beats Q3 Views But Raised Earnings Outlook Implies Weak Q4Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

147,LMT,"The Navy is pushing for a multiship order of aircraft carriers to help reduce costs, but a debate remains over the need for such large warships as adversaries develop sophisticated weapons that put them at greater risk.XNavy Secretary Richard Spencer told the Wall Street Journal that shipbuilders suggested buying two aircraft carriers at a time when he asked industry how the service could reduce costs.Huntington Ingalls (HII), which was spun off from Northrop Grumman (NOC) in 2011, is the only prime contractor for aircraft carriers.""If we can tighten up our government-supplied equipment and have a very efficient hull build, we are starting to get savings that are very meaningful,"" Spencer said, though he didn't say how much could be saved.But critics are increasingly questioning the need for carriers, now that adversaries have weapons that could reduce their effectiveness.For example, China's DF-21D and longer-range DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles have been dubbed ""carrier killers."" Russia's Oscar II-class submarines are designed to counter carriers.The emergence of such weapons comes amid spiraling costs for carriers, which can now cost up to $13 billion each and may have to operate farther away from battles, stretching the effective range of the aircraft they carry.But Spencer told the Journal that the Navy still views carriers as a key element and has the technology to protect them.Currently, Congress only approves the purchase of one carrier at a time, but the Pentagon is pushing for other bulk orders to save money.Top defense officials are seeking a 440-plane order of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in the hopes that such a ""block buy"" will save up to $2 billion.Shares of Huntington Ingalls were down 8 cents at 234.81 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares rose 0.4% to 316.89, still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 308.58 entry point last month. Northrop rose 0.2%, above buy range. General Dynamics (GD), which also makes Navy warships, advanced 0.7% and is still in buying territory.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The debate over the aircraft carrier's long-term effectiveness comes as President Trump wants to expand the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from 275 today.Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers. The money could be used to buy less-expensive, smaller ships.RELATED: President Trump, Republicans Still Face Defense Spending ShowdownDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

148,LMT,"Stocks were lower across the board Tuesday as General Electric (GE) and Apple (AAPL) slid further and earnings reports weighed.X Nasdaq QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.6%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) eased 0.4% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 0.3%.GE tumbled 8%, continuing its Monday drop, when it plunged 7% after a disappointing forecast and a 50% cut in its dividend. Disney (DIS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also weighed on the Dow with a losses of more than 1% each.Apple extended its loss to 1.2% as it heads toward a fourth consecutive decline. The iPhone maker's shares are still extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point. Apple's drop may be related to Taiwan-based iPhone assembler Foxconn, which sank after a disappointing Q3 profit, according to MarketWatch.Energy, biotech and semiconductors led the downside among sector plays in the stock market today. VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) sank about 3% each, while United States Oil (USO) and PowerShares DB Oil (DBO) fell 2% apiece. West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 2% to $55.64 a barrel.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) lost 3% and iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) pulled back 2%, both to their lowest levels since late August.Utilities, banks and homebuilders bucked the selloff. SPDR Utilities (XLU) gained 0.5%, following through on a Monday breakout past a 56 flat-base entry. It remains in buy range. Most gold funds saw modest gains as gold futures climbed 0.3% to $1,282.70 an ounce.Stocks getting hit Tuesday included Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), down 5%, and TJX Cos. (TJX), down nearly 5%, after their earnings reports.Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other leading defense stocks have eased from their highs, but will they find support and offer a new entry?That's what investors watching iShares U.S. Aerospace (ITA) want to know. The ETF is holding at the support line — a solid rebound off the 50-day moving average would mark a potential buy opportunity. Last time it bounced off the line in late June, shares advanced as much as 19% to an Oct. 23 intraday high.The $4.8 billion fund, which launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index. It's trended higher since the presidential election last year, when defense, bank and building-related stocks took off amid expectations for a Trump bump.ITA has been no slouch over the longer haul, either. Though it endured a 61% drop from 2007 to 2009, as the Great Recession took its toll on the market, it's headed mostly higher since.The fund has soared 28.6% this year through Nov. 10, according to Morningstar Direct, outperforming the S&P 500's 17.3% year-to-date gain. An average annual return of 18.5% and 24.3% for the past three and five years, respectively, are also ahead of the benchmark index's 10.5% and 15.8% gains. The ETF also leads with an 11.4% average annual return for the past 10 years vs. 8.2% for the S&P 500.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.ITA's top holdings as of Nov. 10 include Boeing, with a 10% weighting. The jet maker on Monday announced a surprise order for 40 Dreamliners from Dubai's Emirates airline, which was expected to strike a deal with Airbus for its A380 jets. Boeing shares rose 0.6% for the session and were up 69% YTD through Monday's close.United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop and General Dynamics (GD) rounded out ITA's top five, which accounted for nearly 40% of assets. The fund holds 38 stocks in its portfolio.ITA carries a 0.44% expense ratio.RELATED:Nvidia, Top Tech Stocks Power Gains For Innovator IBD 50, SOXXBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This3 Dow Stocks Rally As GE Sinks; Big Dividend Play In Buy Zone?

149,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) are among top defense companies reporting earnings this week as increasing global tensions have helped lift their stocks.XAnalysts expect the F-35 maker's earnings to fall 10% to $3.25 per share but revenue is seen rising 11% to $12.83 billion.F-35 deliveries are skewed to the back-half of the year, giving Lockheed a likely boost in Q3. The company is expected to deliver 66 of the fighters this year, up from 46 in 2016.Missile defense sales should also be a hot topic on the company's conference call for the maker of the THAAD antimissile system.""The pace of inquiries, the depth of the inquiries and intensity are increasing month by month,"" Timothy Cahill, the VP of Integrated Air & Missile Defense told reporters at the annual Association of the United States Army conference earlier this month.Cahill said Lockheed is getting interest from countries, especially in Europe, that didn't have a high priority on missile defense in the past.The U.S. is also focused on increasing missile defense at home. The Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs like Lockheed's Aegis systems.Lockheed closed Friday at 320, still in buy range from a 308.58 buy point cleared in late September.Northrop Grumman is out Wednesday. Analysts see EPS dipping 3% to $2.92 with revenue up 2.6% to $6.3 billion.The company will likely give updates on its $9.2 billion buyout of Orbital ATK (OA) announced during the quarter.The deal gives helps Northrop expand its missile defense capabilities and catch up to rivals in the market, because Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for Boeing's (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It also builds target vehicles for tests.It could also help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system.But Northorp will likely stay quiet about its secretive B-21 bomber. At an Air Force Association breakfast last week, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the program is on track and ""marching to acquisitions timelines.""Boeing, General Dynamics (GD) and FLIR (FLIR) are also out Wednesday.Northrop and Boeing shares are just out of buying range, while FLIR is somewhat extended. But General Dynamics, at 213.86, is in a buy zone from a 206 entry.On Thursday, analysts see Raytheon reporting a 6% increase in EPS to $1.90 and a 5% boost in revenue to $6.33 billion.The company has been a big beneficiary of the growing demand for missile defense systems. Raytheon also builds the Patriot, which was purchased by Romania over the summer. A big Patriot contract with Poland has also been signed, while countries in the Middle East and Asia are lining up to buy or upgrade systems.Raytheon is well extended from a May breakout.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingTech, Industrial, Medical, Consumer Giants Top Investing Action PlanDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News
"
150,LMT,"The most disruptive battlefield technology since the advent of stealth may be just a few years away, and the U.S. is locked in a race with Russia and China to develop it first.XHypersonic weapons are being designed to travel at five times the speed of sound, rendering their targets nearly defenseless and promising to rewrite battle plans around the world.""We still want to have stealth capabilities, but I would like to argue that hypersonics give you next-level capabilities,"" said Mark Lewis, chair of the Institute for Defense Analyses' Science and Technology Policy Institute. ""With stealth, they can't see me. With hypersonics, even if they do see me, there's not a lot they can do to stop me.""The Pentagon awarded contracts last year for hypersonic test vehicles, and prototypes are expected in 2020. Later this year, a separate contract for a hypersonic strike weapon to be launched from fighters and bombers will be awarded to either Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN), or Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop. Meanwhile, China and Russia are expected to field hypersonic weapons sometime in the next decade.A Rand Corp. report last month highlighted the disruptive potential of hypersonic weapons, warning that even a relatively small hypersonic arsenal could threaten a major power's forward-projected forces, or even their homelands.Deeper into the future, aircraft equipped with hypersonic technology could further disrupt warfighting or even commercial airspace. And outer space could become more accessible with hypersonic vehicles as more companies look to low-cost launch options.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Eventually, hypersonics could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the aerospace industry. But the price of each weapon system is still unknown because too few weapons have been built to get a good figure, Lewis notes.In addition to warfighters, Pentagon number crunchers could see upside in the new technology as well. While individual hypersonic missiles would be more expensive than conventional ones, some argue that firing hypersonics, which are more deadly, could prove more effective on targets and less expensive in practice, he adds.""It's part of the discussion we are having today,"" Lewis said.To be sure, hypersonic weapons wouldn't be the fastest on the planet. Traditional intercontinental ballistic missiles fly at 20 times the speed of sound. But they follow predictable trajectories.Existing missile-defense systems like Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system and Raytheon's Patriot system all work by predicting where and when incoming missiles will land.But hypersonic weapons combine speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them extremely difficult, if not impossible, to shoot down with today's technology.""So our radars and antimissile missile systems aren't really designed to defend against them, in theory,"" said Greg Zacharias, chief scientist of the Air Force.That means aircraft carriers, the linchpin of America's ability to project force abroad, would be vulnerable to hypersonic weapons, severely limiting where they could operate.But at the Association of the U.S. Army conference earlier this month, Tim Cahill, vice president of air and missile defense at Lockheed, said some of its existing systems like THAAD and Aegis ""have a lot of capability right now against"" hypersonic targets even though they weren't designed to take out those types of weapons.The company is working on enhancements, like improving radars and command and control systems. But existing systems still have areas that minor adjustments won't address. While Cahill wouldn't give a specific timeline, he acknowledged a need for larger modifications that will take years to complete.""With something as disruptive as hypersonics, all services will have to rethink how they do business,"" said Fred Kennedy, director of the tactical technology office at the Pentagon's secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The Missile Defense Agency has requested more than $75 million to research potential methods for defending against hypersonic weapons.There is also a window to intercept hypersonic weapons in their initial, or ""boost,"" phase when they behave more like regular ICBMs, says Ian Williams, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But for now, the U.S. doesn't have an operational boost-phase defense system.On the flip side, America's adversaries would be unable to defend against hypersonic weapons screaming toward them, making them optimal in time-critical situations.If the U.S. saw North Korea or another hostile power readying a missile for launch, an American hypersonic weapon could be quickly deployed and take out the missile before it took off, Zacharias says.The U.S. military has flirted with hypersonic weapons technology on and off for years. But a new urgency has taken over as U.S. adversaries and emerging powers pursue hypersonics.The White House Office of Management and Budget released a report in August listing hypersonic weapons and defenses as a top research and development priority. And the administration's fiscal 2018 budget request includes $292.5 million for hypersonic science and technology. That's up from just $79 million spent in 2012. Then there's the contract for a hypersonic weapon expected to be awarded by the Pentagon this year.Those efforts would build on a breakthrough that came with the 2013 flight of Boeing's X-51 Waverider, which provided proof that hypersonic technology was feasible.Now Darpa is looking at two major technologies: a tactical boost glide vehicle and the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC).The glider concept envisions a rocket that carries a weapon to Mach 5 or above. Once that speed is reached, the weapon would separate from the rocket and ""glide"" at hypersonic speed to its target. Last year, Darpa awarded Lockheed a $147 million contract to build a prototype.The HAWC envisions a ""scramjet"" hypersonic engine, which would use its forward trajectory to compress incoming air, instead of relying on an oxidizer like a rocket does. Without the extra fuel, the engine is lighter and can fly faster. In 2016, Darpa awarded Raytheon a $174.7 million contract and Lockheed a $171.2 million contract for the HAWC. Zacharias says prototypes are on track for delivery in 2020.In an earlier interview with IBD, Orbital ATK predicted hypersonic weapons would become a reality in the next five years, saying the company has the technological know-how to manufacture hypersonic vehicles.Meanwhile, Russia is working on a hypersonic glide vehicle as part of its Project 4202, and China is developing its own DF-ZF hypersonic glider. Russia is also developing the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile. India is working on its own hypersonic missile, the BrahMos II, with Russia. Australia, Japan and some European countries have hypersonic programs as well.""Interest in (hypersonics) seems to really be spiking in the Pentagon, in part because some other countries like China have gotten extremely active in this technology area themselves,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.Further into the future, the Air Force is looking at hypersonic drones and vehicles that don't need to be launched from an aircraft or rocket.Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works division and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) have been working on a proof-of-concept plane as an update to the iconic SR-71 Blackbird spy plane.The new unmanned vehicle would fly at Mach 6, twice as fast as its predecessor, thanks to a traditional turbine engine that takes the plane to Mach 3, coupled with a scramjet engine that propels the SR-72 to hypersonic speeds. The plane could be ready for use by 2030.""The technology is mature,"" Rob Weiss, Lockheed's Skunk Works chief, told IBD in July. Hypersonics are ""ready to be demonstrated. There has been steady progress to advance the technology, which is our primary focus now.""And if you combine hypersonic aircraft with hypersonic missiles? That could enable an attack into defended airspace ""at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour,"" according to Lockheed.The Air Force's Zacharias said commercial players could be interested in using hypersonic scramjet engines to get flights into orbit because it would be cheaper than using a rocket.Lower-cost access to space is becoming a bigger commercial priority amid plans to launch new satellite constellations.The technology could reduce travel time from the U.S. to Tokyo to three hours, says John Hernandez, senior analyst at the Frost & Sullivan consulting firm. That's down from more than 12 hours on a nonstop commercial flight today.And hypersonics don't have the same problem with sonic booms that supersonic jets have, because they fly higher in the atmosphere.Still, significant government participation would be needed for commercial development.""It's hard to imagine a startup company having the resources to invest in the levels needed to make space applications possible,"" Lewis said. ""That's the government's role. One realm that NASA can contribute to is civilian applications.""RELATED:Pentagon Looks To Speed Up These Missile Defense SystemsAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

152,LMT,"Key indexes remained near the breakeven point Thursday afternoon after the first set of top-tier banks Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported decent third-quarter results, officially kicking off Q3 earnings season.XBoth Citi and JPMorgan fell in heavy turnover, but are not triggering any sell signals.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly retook its former buy point from a flat base at 156.75 while social media phenom Snap (SNAP) jumped sharply for a second straight session.Apple is trying to stretch its win streak to four sessions and got as high as 157.37. Investors with conviction or a big cushion of gains in the stock may purchase shares, but volume is largely absent. Another strategy would be to wait for the iPhone giant to climb back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 158, or wait even longer and see if it can form a new base.At 2:30 pm ET, The Nasdaq composite edged slightly lower after marking a new all-time high of 6613.50. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were all virtually flat.Volume was running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.Apple had rallied a little more than 5% after clearing its 11-week flat base on Aug. 2 following its best EPS growth in nearly a year. The pullback to below the 156.75 entry and drop below the 50-day moving average reflected a sobering of investors' minds after the company unveiled its iPhone 8 and X models.However, such drops back to a proper buy point are not unusual, even among big market winners. IBD has noted in the past that as many as four out of 10 true leaders will backtrack to or near the buy point in a proper base, shaking out weak holders, before resuming its rally.Plus, Apple did not trigger the golden rule of selling.Apple has gained more than 39% since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle. Investors who bought at that prime entry would be justified in taking gains, but those who wish to see if there is room to run may hold until the stock shows a devastating break of the 10-week moving average (as seen on an IBD weekly chart; the 10-week line is painted in red) in massive volume.That has yet to occur.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column on Wednesday, the iPhone, Apple Watch and iMac marketer is in the middle of a slow yet steady turnaround in its fundmentals. IBD research has pointed out that nearly one out of four of the best stock market winners in history were corporate turnaround situations.In such cases, the stock's recent price-and-volume action, RS Rating, relative strength line and changes in current quarterly numbers matter far more than conventional IBD measures of growth that look at longer time periods. For instance, IBD's EPS Rating looks at both annual profit performance over the past three to five years as well as those in the past few quarters.For this reason, IPOs tend to have weaker EPS Ratings, because they have a younger record of profits.Snap, however, did trigger the golden rule of investing after it tried to rally back following a fireworks-like debut on the NYSE and a spectacular 34% free-fall in two weeks' time in March. Those who tried to buy later that month broke a key IBD rule, which is to never buy a stock before its base fully forms.While the rebound from an 18.90 low on March 17 to as high as 24.40 six sessions later was impressive, Snap was still in basing mode. Those who bought on the way up were forced to cut their losses at 8% or less.Now, shares in the money-losing social media network are trying to fashion an authentic first-stage base following a 62% slide from its all-time high of 29.44.Snap has lost money every year since 2015 despite showing excellent top-line growth. Shares are rising amid bullish comments made by Credit Suisse. Morgan Stanley is Snap's chief investment banker.In the second quarter, Venice, Calif.-based Snap lost 16 cents a share even though revenue soared 153% to $181.7 million, a quarterly record. Snap showed gross margin of $29.5 million, or 16.2% of total revenue. However, Snap also marked an operating loss of $449 million as R&D costs rose 608%, sales and marketing expense jumped 270%, and general and administrative costs ran up 308%.Defense firms continue to rally amid an ongoing threat of military conflict between North Korea and the U.S. Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose 0.7% to 320.95 to mark its 10th straight gain. The F-35 fighter jet maker is up nearly 19% after rising past a 269.84 flat-base entry in mid-March.Lockheed's earnings per share have climbed 49%, 24%, 8% and 12% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters amid revenue increases of 15%, 19%, 7% and 10%.Are there other relatively young IPOs (going public in the past five years or later) that are making money and doing well in the market today? Sure.Square (SQ), Five Below (FIVE), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), eBay spin-off PayPal (PYPL), YY (YY), Jupai (JP) and others are just some examples. Most of these inhabit the IBD 50. Watch for follow-on entry points or new bases to develop.On Thursday's economic news, weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 243,000, below the Econoday forecast of 252,000 and 17,000 claims less than the prior week.Crude oil dropped hard after U.S. inventories slumped by 2.7 million barrels, a smaller drawdown than the 6 million barrel decline in the prior week. WTI futures on the NYMEX fell 1.4% to $50.56 a barrel. Gold jumped more than 0.6% and futures hit a session high of $1,299.80 a troy ounce.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

156,LMT,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — The head of Air Force Space Command offered a bullish, albeit qualified, endorsement of the commercial space sector's efforts to launch reusable rockets, continuing a rapid shift away from the military's prior skepticism.XCurrent rockets for the Air Force are one and done, a practice that Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has likened to using a Boeing (BA) 747 once. But the space industry is looking for ways to make space travel affordable, and the Air Force is warming up to the idea of reusability.""That's the way industry is going. It's cost effective,"" Gen. John Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, told reporters at the Air Force Association's annual Air Space & Cyber conference Wednesday. ""But we need to do a review to make sure they are safe. Then I'm all in for using reusable rockets to launch our satellites.""The Air Force, which needs reliable rockets to deliver sensitive spy satellites and mission-critical GPS satellites, hasn't been so open to the idea in the past.Just last year, the director of launch enterprise for Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center said it could be a ""long time"" before the Pentagon OKs a reusable rocket to launch national security payloads.But in April, a month after SpaceX launched its first payload with a reused rocket, Raymond signaled openness to it, saying ""I don't think we can say we won't follow suit."" SpaceX had been testing boosters can land on both land or a drone ship. That culminated with the launch in March, when a Falcon 9 rocket sent a telecommunications satellite from Europe's SES into orbit. In June, SpaceX did it for a second time, sending Bulgaria's first communications satellite into space.But the entire rocket isn't reused. The SpaceX launches incorporated a reused, or ""flight proven,"" first stage, which includes a booster that holds the fuel and nine engines.SpaceX has said launches with reused first stages could be 30% lower than the current $62 million the company charges to customers. In April, Musk tweeted that he was "" fairly confident"" the upper stage, which includes the nose cone that keeps the payload safe, could be reusable, with the entire rocket able to be reused by late 2018.SpaceX's rival are also working on reusability. Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos, plans for his New Glenn rocket to have a reusable first stage.And United Launch Alliance, a Boeing- Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, is developing reusable booster main engines that can be captured in midair as well as a reusable upper stage with improved performance for ULA's existing systems. Both are scheduled to debut in the mid-2020s, said a ULA spokeswoman.Shares of Boeing closed up 0.2% on the stock market today and remain in buying territory after breaking out from a flat base on Monday. Lockheed ended virtually flat at 308.01, below its 308.58 entry.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.In addition to the cost savings, there's another upside to launching reusable rockets. Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the 45th Space Wing, noted in an interview Tuesday that engineers can actually look at the hardware after it's flown.For instance, a Falcon rocket had a problem with its GPS systems that likely wouldn't have been discernible from the telemetry data alone, he said. Crews looked at the rocket when it came down and discovered that there wan't enough silicon around a screw.RELATED: SpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks NowDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

157,LMT,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — SpaceX, which was founded by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, has pushed the Air Force to change its ways and go faster.XThe Air Force has a long history with space launches, from the Atlas program to the space shuttle, but upstart SpaceX forced the regimented service to change the way it does business.""It might have taken us a decade to change our process. But in order to support SpaceX, we just throttled that up,"" Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the 45th Space Wing, said in an interview at the Air Force Association's annual Air Space & Cyber conference. ""So they are making us better, and that's great.""But the relationship between SpaceX and the Air Force wasn't always so great.In 2014, SpaceX sued the Air Force, saying it was allowing United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of  Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), to have a monopoly on military launches.SpaceX dropped the suit a year later and the relationship warmed.""My job is to manage risk and keep the public safe,"" Monteith said. ""So, I embrace what they bring to the table to increase our launch rate and increase our throughput. The more business they bring in, the cheaper we can provide launch services, the more often we can launch. That spurs growth in the industry, which is good for the taxpayer as well.""IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks.

Next year, it plans to have 35 launches, with 28 of them commercial. ""The paradigm has completely shifted. We have to adopt commercial business practices. We have to be innovative.

158,LMT,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — Defense Secretary James Mattis said Wednesday he has talked to the Air Force chief of staff about ""new ways"" to perform a key airborne command and control ""mission,"" following recent questions about whether the $7 billion program would go forward.XThe Air Force opened the competition late last year on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program to replace Northrop Grumman's (NOC) E-8.Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop are leading teams with bids for the aircraft, which would perform airborne command and control and conduct ground surveillance.But the Air Force acknowledged last week that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches for battlefield command and control that could be more effective in high-threat environments,"" according to Defense News.Top service officials have said an alternative approach to having a single aircraft would be to instead network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until a more survivable system is developed.On Wednesday, Mattis didn't directly address the JSTARS program but noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" said Mattis at the Air Force Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. ""I'm eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.""Northrop shares climbed 0.7% at 280.18 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out Monday.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Mattis also called for more communication with industry partners, especially in Silicon Valley, to ""find the best bang for the buck.""He told service leaders to ""find the most far-reaching innovations out there"" by being open to talking to industry leaders, ""within the bounds of ethical regulations.""""Make certain the lines of communication are open in a way that we can aggressively and swiftly take advantage of opportunities that we see developing around us in the private sector,"" Mattis said.He said the Pentagon is working to reform business practices inside the Defense Department and is taking a look on how to quickly take advantage of technology such as software development.""Do we really need the same process when we're doing small programs vs. a major aircraft program?"" Mattis asked.The Pentagon has been embracing Silicon Valley with its Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) program, which seeks to tap into the tech sector to help keep the Pentagon on the cutting edge.Mattis recalled his time living in Silicon Valley after he left the Marine Corps, saying that ""nothing is more reminding of just how innovative America is than to live in Silicon Valley and see how they are changing the world we live in.""RELATED: Air Force Eyes Light-Attack Plane But This Is 'Job One'Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop Grumman

But the agreement has become strained as political tensions between the U.S. and Russia heat up.In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing (BA) and Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk's SpaceX to develop American vehicles for astronauts.NASA had originally envisioned both companies competing in test flights and being certificated for manned missions by the end of 2017.

Orbital was at the high end of a buy range from a 105.19 entry as of Friday's close.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and Orbital will operate as a new business sector within Northrop for the foreseeable future, according to executives from both companies on a conference call Monday.Northrop management said the deal will add to earnings a year after it closes, and stressed there is little overlap between the two companies.But Orbital's ammunition offerings might be spun-off in the future.""From an ammunition perspective, we're not big fans of adding ammo capability to Northrop's portfolio, given we don't see a large land war breaking out anytime soon,"" Skibitski said.Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial Partners, said in an interview that he expects no objections from the Pentagon or Federal Trade Commission over the deal.But Vertical Research Partners aerospace and defense analyst Rob Stallard noted that this will be the first major defense acquisition of the Trump administration era. ""This is a test case as to whether concerns over the scale of the primes is still an issue,"" he wrote.Boeing could also make a counterbid as some aspects of missile defense and precision munitions are important to the aerospace giant, but those are rare, he wrote.The deal could spark more merger and acquisition activity in the defense space.""I think this and the Rockwell/United Technologies deal would suggest there is a move towards consolidation,"" Hunter said.But investors might not see companies on the lookout for more missile defense or space companies per se as the sector shrinks.""Interest in other companies may not be a directly comparable move. We are at a state in the industry where there is only so many moves you an make, but that doesn't mean you can't make a move in another direction.""The U.S. and its allies have ramped up missile defense testing and deployment as North Korea continues its missile testing and reportedly has an ICBM that can hit the U.S.In May, Boeing's GMD system was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and successfully intercepted a target ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands. It was the 10th successful test in 18 attempts, but prior tests have failed, including two tests in 2010 that were carefully scripted with the dimensions, trajectory and speed as known factors.Meanwhile, Lockheed's THAAD system is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska. In July, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency announced that its THAAD system in Kodiak, Alaska, successfully intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time in a test. So far, the system has a perfect 14-out-of-14 record in tests since 2005.Raytheon makes the popular Patriot system, which is useful against conventional weapons and has a range of just 12 miles, while Lockheed produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor missiles.RELATED:As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

165,LMT,"It may seem a bit far out — plans to send humans on a roughly seven-month, 34-million-mile ride to Mars, all for the privilege of standing where temperatures can get to 100 degrees below zero.XBut colonizing Mars is a central reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA),  founded his rocket-ship company SpaceX 15 years ago. Musk, who spends equal time between Tesla and SpaceX, is one of four billionaires who are using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism.The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts. They imagine a world where entrepreneurs can create business opportunities in space that include galaxies of small satellites controlling gadgets on the ground and initiatives to send humans on thrill rides to the moon, all outside the reach of government budget battles and a fickle voting public. Musk has said many times that the ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make Earth's population a space-faring society.SpaceX, based in Los Angeles County, already has taken a step into the heavens, ferrying supplies to the International Space Station. It's keeping an eye on further commercial exploration of the final frontier.""It's a fantastic time to be in the industry,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, founder of Bryce Space and Technology, a research and consulting firm for space and satellite industries.Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000, Christensen says. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, she adds. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.""Musk changed the narrative, transforming the way people think and talk about space technology in a very inspirational way,"" Christensen said.Other billionaires doing business in the great beyond include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who established Blue Origin 16 years ago to make rocket ships for space tourism and science missions. Bezos recently said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen has Stratolaunch Systems, which he co-founded to build the world's largest aircraft by wingspan, able to carry rockets to the edge of space to deliver small satellites into orbit. It has a partnership with Orbital ATK (OA).And Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is another space enthusiast. His company, Virgin Galactic, aims to be ready to launch its first passengers on thrill rides to suborbital space later this year. The cost per seat? $250,000. The spacecraft seats six with a two-person crew. Science missions are also planned.Musk, Bezos, Branson and Allen have brought back to life a U.S. space business that was demoralized by the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, Christensen says. Of the four, Musk has done the most to demonstrate an economic case for space, enticing previously reluctant venture capitalists to invest billions in the commercial transports outside the stratosphere.Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, acquired from the sale of PayPal (PYPL), which he co-founded, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. SpaceX now has a private-sector valuation of about $12 billion and holds multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and deliver astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX also has extensive contracts to launch commercial satellites.Bezos' Blue Origin has made several test flights of its rocket, New Shepard, which is designed as a reusable spacecraft for space tourism that will fly passengers to the edge of space, about 62 miles high. It has made several successful launches but has not yet begun commercial operations.Blue Origin is building another rocket ship, called New Glenn, that it says will be taller and more powerful than the biggest rocket in development by SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy. The company's rockets are named after two of the original seven NASA Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard and John Glenn.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. New products or services are what ultimately generates stellar profitability. None of the four billionaire-founded space startups in this article trades publicly, but you can scroll our IBD 50 list of top stocks to discover other innovative companies. Bezos made billions from his creation of Amazon, which he has used to self-fund most of Blue Origin. He's pumped an estimated $1 billion in Blue Origin. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX.SpaceX initially fueled the jump in space activity by pushing down the cost of rocket launches. That put the ability to catch a ride to space well within the reach of entrepreneurs to create various commercial space operations.Phillip Spector, counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, says lowering the cost of space access was critical for commercial expansion. Before joining Milbank, Spector was executive vice president of business development and general counsel at Intelsat (I), one of the largest satellite operators worldwide.At Intelsat, ""The biggest issue we faced was around launch, the pricing for launch and availability. There were not enough suppliers,"" Spector said. ""The addition of competition from SpaceX was very welcome.""Investors have yet to benefit from this new wave of enthusiasm.Shares of many large space companies and government contractors have long traded on the public markets, including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK, Harris Corp. (HRS), ViaSat (VSAT) and Orbcomm (ORBC). Boeing and Lockheed Martin have a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance that provides spacecraft launch services and competes against SpaceX.But there has yet to be a high-profile IPO from the crop of startup companies now flooding the market. The company best positioned for a possible IPO is SpaceX, which would undoubtedly draw widespread attention. But SpaceX recently shot down rumors that a public stock offering was in the planning.""Musk has been clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public,"" said Spector. ""We're not seeing a rush to IPOs among space companies out here today. I don't see Bezos or Branson having the need to take their company public.""But that hasn't stopped the chunks of money flowing into the market.""The funding environment for startup companies is robust,"" said Spector.Startup companies have focused on a number of narrow business models. One is building and launching fleets of small satellites to circle the Earth in a low orbit.They're using the satellites to study agriculture trends, track ships, produce high-frequency weather reports and study water pollution patterns, among other things. There's also a big market in the making with the advent of what's called the Internet of Things, which includes machine-to-machine communication.""These startups are doing some truly innovative things, using off-the-shelf technology and getting near the performance of assets that were 10 times the cost,"" said Dara Panahy, a Milbank partner who represents clients in aerospace and communications. ""That is a real game-changer.""Then there are massive projects such as OneWeb, which plans to launch the first of 700 satellites next year to provide high-speed internet and other communication services. Partners in the OneWeb venture include Branson, Qualcomm (QCOM), SoftBank (SFTBY), Airbus (EADSY) and Coca-Cola (KO). Investors plowed $1.2 billion into OneWeb in 2016.""The market has matured and grown and, along with some of the other enabling technologies, that lowered barriers to getting into space,"" said Panahy. ""So now you have true venture-capital-funded startups and angel-funded startups that can now launch on maybe less than $100,000.""That compares with launches in the tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases today.Among the space startups is Rocket Lab, which has developed a rocket from scratch that's designed for frequent launches to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab had the first test of its rocket, called Electron, in May. It plans to conduct two more test flights in 2017 and launch customer payloads next year.At full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year. In comparison, last year saw 22 launches from the U.S. and 82 internationally, according to Rocket Lab.Acquisitions have helped draw venture capital. They're the primary way VCs get a return on investment. Fifteen space-related companies have been acquired for a total value of $3.2 billion since 2000, demonstrating a return on investment that venture capitalists want to see.Among the acquisitions, Europe-based satellite operator SES paid $703 million to buy the other half of a company called O3b it didn't already own. O3b is a big player in the small-satellite communication field.Another startup is Planet, a maker of small satellites, with about 100 now in orbit, some about the size of a shoe box. Planet, previously known as Planet Labs, can image the whole Earth every 24 hours, providing data that can be used to solve commercial, environmental and humanitarian challenges.RELATED: In Jeff Bezos-Elon Musk Space Race, Score One For Amazon's BezosSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskSpaceX Jumps Aboard Space Tourism With Planned Moon Flight For TwoBezos To Launch Blue Origin Rockets At Cape Canaveral

166,LMT,"A surprise budget accord between President Trump and Democrats on Wednesday left open important questions regarding defense funding. Trump's grand plan to increase military spending and boost troop levels is good news for defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), but Congress returned to Capitol Hill at the start of September with a much smaller…
"
167,LMT,"The Japanese and South Korean governments have unveiled military budget increases geared toward defending against the growing threat from North Korea.XOn Thursday, Japan's Defense Ministry released a request for a 2.5% increase in defense spending $47.78 billion for the fiscal year starting in April 2018. Earlier this week, South Korea said it will boost its military budget next year by 6.9% to $38.4 billion, the biggest hike in eight years.The ministry has earmarked $160 million for missile development programs, including $90 million for studying hypersonic weapons, which fly at five times the speed of sound and could more easily evade enemy defenses, according to Reuters.Japan's defense budget also includes money for Raytheon's (RTN) ship-to-air SM-3 Block IIA missiles that have double the range of Japan's current ship-based missiles, and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) surface-to-air PAC-3 missile for use in the Patriot system.Lockheed's Aegis Ashore missile-defense system or Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system are under consideration too, but a decision between the two isn't expected until later this year.Other defense expenditures include six Lockheed F-35 fighters, four V-22 Ospreys made by Boeing (BA) and Textron's (TXT) Bell unit, a submarine and two compact warships.In South Korea, the government plans to spend more money on spy satellites, surveillance drones, missile defense systems, and long-range air-to-surface missiles, among other things.President Moon Jae-in also approved recently the full deployment of South Korea's THAAD antimissile battery, which was highly controversial earlier this year. The first two antimissile launchers were deployed in April.Raytheon shares were down 0.1% in midday trading on the stock market today, but have soared nearly 30% this year. Lockheed eased 0.2%, and Boeing lost 0.5%. But like Raytheon, defense stocks in general have been strong performers this year, with many well above buying range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.North Korea has become more aggressive with its missile tests in recent months. On Tuesday, it launched an intermediate-range ballistic Hwasong-12 that can fly up to 3,000 miles over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch an ""unprecedented serious and grave threat"" that ""significantly undermines the peace and security of the region"" and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.The missile test came during joint U.S.-South Korea war games that Pyongyang is against. On Thursday four Lockheed F-35B fighter jets and two B-1B bombers joined four South Korean Boeing F-15 fighters in a show of force flyover of the Korean Peninsula.RELATED:As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksRaytheon Hits New High As Latest N.

168,LMT,"Boeing (BA) will lay off some 50 executives from its defense and space segment by year-end as part of a reorganization to make the aerospace giant more competitive and strip away a layer of bureaucracy.""We need to be an agile organization that is more responsive to customers' needs and committed to continually improving productivity,"" Leanne Caret, the company's defense, space and security president, said in a statement late Tuesday.The moves will give Caret more direct oversight.The company also said that its Military Aircraft and Network & Space Systems units would be divided up into four smaller groups: Autonomous Systems, which include some robotics and unmanned systems; Space and Missile Systems, which would include the International Space Station; Strike, Surveillance and Mobility, a unit that would oversee the company's F-15 and F/A-18 fighters and other aircraft; and a Vertical Lift division that would include the AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook helicopters.The new structure of those divisions would take hold on July 1. Those divisions would report to Caret. The company's Development, Global Operations, and Phantom Works will largely remain the same, the company said.Shares of Boeing, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 0.7% to 192.38 in the stock market today. Lockheed Martin (LMT) edged up 0.7%, while Northrop Grumman (NOC) advanced 0.8%. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are all in buy zones.Boeing pays a quarterly dividend of $1.42 a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 3%.Since Caret began work at the helm of the defense, space and security division last year, Boeing has said it would close some facilities move its defense segment's headquarters to Virginia to be closer to the Pentagon.RELATED:Boeing Rival Airbus Sees Key Reversal In Warning On Aircraft Demand5 Top Deals Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon May Get From Saudis — If They Pay Up

169,LMT,"Boeing's (BA) launch of its 737 Max 10 stretch and more details on a completely new midrange plane will likely be the big news stories out of the Paris Air Show, which starts Monday.Still, overall expectations are subdued for this year's event, with orders expected to be down. After a buying frenzy a few years ago, airlines are taking a breather while Boeing and rival Airbus (EADSY) scramble to work through their steep backlog of orders.And with oil prices staying low, airlines have been able to fly older, less fuel-efficient planes for longer. Carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) recently have delayed delivery of new jets.""New aircraft orders are expected to be relatively meager,"" Rob Stallard, a Vertical Research Partners analyst, wrote in a note. ""Although the trend for new orders would appear worrying, we expect aerospace companies to still be positive on the outlook for continued growth.""Airbus has booked only 73 net orders in the first five months of 2017, down 55% from a year-ago and Boeing only had 56 at the end of May, though China Aircraft Leasing Group on Thursday announced an order for 50 737 Max jets with a list price of $5.8 billion.Another missing demand catalyst is the lack of a new aircraft. But that could change soon, and the Paris Air Show may be the start of a push to stoke interest.""Middle market is going to be the big thing, "" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group. ""You'll see Boeing talk about new midsize aircraft.""Boeing is considering building a brand-new midrange plane, informally dubbed the ""797"" by some in the industry, as it looks to take back market share from Airbus' A321neo, which has allowed airlines to open new routes that weren't accessible with smaller planes and not profitable with larger ones.So far, Boeing has kept any details under wraps but could start talking it up at Paris so top customers hold off on any A321neo orders and instead wait for the 797. The new plane could carry 200-275 passengers up to 5,000 nautical miles and is expected to be available by 2024-2025.Airbus isn't waiting for an official launch. To counter the 797, the European company is reportedly working on a bigger variant of the A321 that would have new wings and a longer cabin. The A322neo would seat more than 240 passengers, vs. the 180-240 capacity for the A321, and fly farther than the A321's maximum range of 4,000 nautical miles.But both the 797 and A322neo won't actually be available for orders next week. What is likely to be unveiled at Paris is Boeing's 737 Max 10, which is seen as a stopgap to keep the A321neo at bay until the 797 is ready.Indonesia's Lion Air will likely be announced as a launch customer when Boeing officially unveils its Max 10, which will carry 190-230 people or 10-15 more than the 737 Max 9. Earlier this month, Lion Air Group President Director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters that the carrier would be a launch customer but wouldn't say how many of the new planes it will buy. United could also be among the first 737 Max 10 customers.Indian full-service carrier Jet Airways also is reportedly in talks to purchase 50 narrow-body jets worth at least $5.6 billion, with the 737 Max 10 seen more likely to be chosen than the A321neo.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing stock just hit a fresh record high and is at the top end of buying territory. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been a top performer this year, rising 25% year to date.All the activity in the midsize sector could help offset weakness in the widebody market.In particular, Airbus' super jumbo A380 could reach the end of its runway, as rising tensions in the Middle East, low oil prices, and President Trump's attempts to ban travel and electronic devices from the Mideast weigh on demand.""Emirates is throttling back their orders. They are pretty much the only customer after this year,"" Aboulafia said. ""Airbus is talking about less than one-per-month rates. That's not sustainable.""RELATED: How Boeing's Air Force Tanker Woes Are Helping Its Commercial PlanesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

172,LMT,"The Trump administration's ""$110 billion arms deal"" with Saudi Arabia announced last month is far from done — as in, the arrangement largely isn't really even a deal yet.And it seems to have echoes of the blaring announcements that President Trump has made in months past, in which companies' already-existing plans to create jobs get recast as massive breakthroughs.But after days of few specifics, at least now we know what the likes of Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA) and Raytheon (RTN) could get from any actual agreement.Among the big-ticket items on Saudi Arabia's long wish list, Lockheed could be set to gain $13.5 billion on the potential sale of seven Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile systems, with delivery of the THAAD systems set for between 2023-2026, according to a White House document obtained by Defense News.Raytheon could get $6.65 billion for ""enhancements"" to Saudi Arabia's Patriot anti-missile system. Raytheon, along with Boeing, could also be in line for $4.46 billion for 104,000 air-to-ground munitions.Other potential sales outlined by the White House document include $5.8 billion to Lockheed for three new KC-130J and 20 C-130J aircraft, with deliveries beginning in 2022. Boeing could also get $6.25 billion in an eight-year ""sustainment deal"" for Saudi Arabia's F-15s.Shares of Lockheed closed down 0.2% on the stock market today, Boeing rose less than 0.1%, and Raytheon added 0.3%. All three stocks are still in buy range.But those weapons and figures, Defense News said Thursday, amount to potential sales, or ""memos of intent,"" that were offered to the kingdom during Trump's visit. Any actual arms sale has to get the OK from the State Department and then Congress.Much of the arrangement announced last month is made up of similar ""intended sales"" of things that the U.S. believes the Saudis will eventually want, the Brookings Institution notes. All of the deals that have been revealed so far, Brookings said, started during President Obama's tenure.RELATED:Why The Air Force Is Less Upbeat Than Boeing On Tanker DeliveryAir Force Sees Another Boeing Tanker Delay Ahead Of Key Review

173,LMT,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

Decades of market research reveals that the market's biggest winners often have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if Lockheed Martin can continue to rebound and hit that benchmark. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereLockheed Martin broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 322.29 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're watching climbs above a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also keep in mind that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Lockheed Martin posted -10% earnings growth last quarter. Sales gains came in at 5%. The next quarterly results are expected on or around Jan. 24.The company holds the No. 27 rank among its peers in the Aerospace/Defense industry group. Heico (HEI), Teledyne Technologies (TDY) and Mercury Systems (MRCY) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIBD Stock Rating Upgrades: Rising Relative StrengthWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

175,LMT,"Boeing (BA) is considering entering the fray to win a multibillion dollar contract to build fighter jets for Canada.However the aerospace giant has yet to decide on whether to tender a bid, which would be a test of its relationship with the country following its controversial trade spat with Canada-based Bombardier (BDRBF). The aircraft manufacturer's relationship with Canada has been damaged since it accused Bombardier of selling its C-Series jet for less than it cost to manufacture with help from government subsidies.X That spurred Bombardier to sell a majority stake in the C-Series jet to Boeing's archrival Airbus (EADSY).Last month the U.S. International Trade Commission unanimously ruled the Boeing had not been harmed, which prevented a Commerce Department recommendation to hit the C-Series jet with a near-300% duty on sales to American carriers from taking effect.In addition Boeing is in talks with the Indian Navy over a deal which would see it sell F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets to the South Asian country, which is the world's biggest arms importer.Shares of the Dow industrials component plunged 5.7% to 329.01 on the stock market today. Bombardier fell 4.2%. Airbus lost 2.65%.Boeing has until has until Friday to express interest in bidding for the Canadian contract to build 88 jets, which is worth $12.1 billion to $15.3 billion.Vice president for sales at Boeing Defense and Space Gene Cunningham was asked at the Singapore Airshow about whether a deal will be pursued.""That is certainly a possibility and we will let you know as that unfolds,"" he told Reuters.Cunningham said the company is studying the implications of the deal.Cunningham also revealed discussions were taking place across Asia for possible future defense sales, including preliminary conversations with Vietnam following the lifting of a U.S. arms embargo in 2016. Another potential deal would see attack helicopters sold to Philippines and Thailand.He also confirmed a potential deal that would see the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets sold to India, though he conceded much technical evaluation has yet to take place.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The F/A-18 Hornet is a twin-engine supersonic carrier-capable combat jet, which can function as both a fighter and an attack bomber.Cunningham also expressed hopes for potential opportunities for its KC-46 multirole tanker, which provides aerial refueling and strategic airlift capabilities, in India and other countries.Last year India's navy invited sales proposals for 57 jets to be used on its aircraft carriers. Its air force is also seeking at least 100 planes. If the orders are combined it is the world's biggest fighter jet order in play, according to Bloomberg.The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants foreign manufacturers to make products locally, and defense giants including Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have said they will produce in India if the contracts are worth enough.Modi is planning to spend $250 billion retooling the country's armed forces in the coming years, with his wide-ranging plans ranging from fighter jets to guns and helmets.Finally Cunningham also said Boeing expects the U.S. to decide on the T-X program in mid-2018.The company is competing with Lockheed for a $16 billion opportunity to build the U.S. Air Force's new training jet, with foreign sales expected to generate even more revenue.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED INAir Force Picks These Planes For Next Light Attack Experiment Boeing Gets $6.6 Billion From Pentagon To Expand Missile Defense Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

177,LMT,"After weeks of delays, SpaceX on Wednesday tested the engines of its Falcon Heavy — the most powerful rocket since the Apollo program's Saturn V — a key step before its maiden flight.X The space company founded by Telsa (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk fired its engines while the rocket was strapped to the launchpad Wednesday.Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so. pic.twitter.com/npaqatbNir— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2018The massive Falcon Heavy stands 230 feet tall and consists of three Falcon 9 first-stage cores. The thrust that its 27 engines can produce is equivalent to 18 Boeing (BA) 747s and makes it two times more powerful than any other rocket operating today, according to SpaceX.After the test, SpaceX can firm up a date for the first launch of the rocket it plans to use for commercial and military missions — and eventually for travel to the moon and Mars.The first flight had been scheduled for later this month, but delays with the static test fire and the government shutdown will likely push the launch into early February. A source told CNBC that SpaceX is now looking at a Feb. 6 launch date but Musk tweeted it could happen in ""a week or so.""IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.According to an Instagram post in December, Musk said the first payload will be a red Tesla Roadster playing David Bowie's Space Oddity on a billion-year elliptical Mars orbit.Musk has also said the first launch will use previously flown rocket outer cores, as SpaceX continues to make the push for reusable rockets to help lower launch costs and keep it competitive against United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture.If the Falcon Heavy's maiden flight is successful, it will launch an Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed sometime early this year and will be used in the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites, as early as April.The Heavy's static fire tests come weeks after a Falcon 9 rocket apparently failed to put the Zuma spy satellite built by Northrop Grumman (NOC) into orbit. But SpaceX has maintained that its rocket ""did everything correctly"" during the Jan. 7 launch.Boeing shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today, Lockheed rose 0.7%, and Northrop dipped 0.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksSpaceX, Boeing To Take This Giant Leap For Space Industry In 2018

178,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported fourth-quarter results ahead of Wall Street expectations Monday and gave strong profit guidance.X Excluding a one-time $1.9 billion charge due to the new tax act, earnings jumped 32% to $4.30 per share while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $4.06 a share on revenue of $14.75 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Lockheed sees 2018 earnings of $15.20-$15.50 a share and revenue of $50 billion to $51.5 billion vs. analyst consensus for earnings of $14 a share on sales of $51.53 billion.Lockheed shares closed up 1.9% to a new high of 351.42 on the stock market today. Boeing (BA), which reports Wednesday, slipped 0.7% to 340.82.Aeronautics unit sales rose 11.8% to $6.04 billion on increased production of the F-35 and deliveries of the C-130 as profit margins widened by 20%. The F-35, the costliest procurement program in Defense Department history, is seeing faster rates of production, and Lockheed met its delivery target last year despite Pentagon warnings that the company would fall short.But the aircraft's performance after it comes off the assembly line has come under scrutiny. A recent report from the Pentagon's top weapons tester found that efforts to improve the F-35's reliability are ""stagnant,"" according to Bloomberg.But Lockheed later defended the program, saying that reliability of the F-35's weapons systems has been improving over successive production lots, with newer jets averaging more than 60% availability.Bloomberg also reported that Lockheed is asking the Pentagon for $212 million for restructuring costs for its acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, claiming it will save taxpayers money.Missile and fire control unit sales jumped 30.5% to $2.29 billion on increased air and missile defense deliveries, but space systems unit sales fell 12% to $2.45 billion on fewer government satellite launches.When asked if some of the tax cut savings could be spent on R&D for efforts to develop a boost phase missile defense — shooting down a missile during the ascent phase — during the conference call, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said that spending on R&D ""would be right in line for our customers.""Missile defense was highlighted as a priority in Washington's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy and Hewson touted a recent test pairing the company's Aegis defense system with the F-35 to spot targets sooner. She also mentioned investments in hypersonics and directed energy R&D.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Rotary and mission systems sales climbed 14% to $4.35 billion. But Lockheed still expects a muted year for commercial helicopters. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said oil and gas will have to stay at $65 per barrel for longer before there will be ramp up in commercial sales.""We're not expecting large increase in commercial helicopters in 2018 and looking flat in 2019,"" he said during the company's conference call. ""But that could change pretty quickly based on oil and gas prices.""Lockheed also said it plans to invest $5 billion in its pension plans to pre-pay through 2021 to see a $1 billion benefit under a new accounting standard.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped fourth-quarter profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue while Northrop beat.Northrop also lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.

179,LMT,"The Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit may transform from a drag on earnings to a significant profit driver over the next decade, according to one analyst.X United Tech invested roughly $15 billion in its next-gen Geared Turbofan (GTF), which allows different engine components to operate at different speeds, improving fuel efficiency while producing less noise and exhaust. Hopes were high as Pratt & Whitney sought to dethrone General Electric's (GE) Leap engine.But manufacturing issues and delays dogged the GTF, testing the patience of shareholders as well as customers like Qatar Airways and Airbus (EADSY). Delta Air Lines (DAL) also has ordered the engines for its 100 A321neo aircraft, set for delivery in early 2020. In October, United Tech backed its target of 350-400 GTF deliveries for 2017 as it resolves production problems.In a note to clients Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell wrote that initial ""engine teething issues"" seem to have been fixed, paving the path for a successful ramp-up in GTF production and deliveries.""We believe the long-term growth opportunity at Pratt & Whitney is underappreciated, not just as the GTF ramps up and engine kinks are fully derisked, but also given the rich aftermarket opportunity from its large installed base of V2500s, competitive take-aways on key upcoming business jet platforms, and Pratt's sole-source position on all three Air Force mega programs,"" McConnell said.The Connecticut-based United Tech, a Dow Jones industrial average components, competes with fellow Dow stock GE and Rolls-Royce in the aerospace and defense markets, supplying engines to massive Pentagon programs like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.McConnell expects 2018 to mark the final year of margin headwinds in Pratt that have weighed on United Tech shares. The business could generate double-digit operating profit growth over the next 10 years, driving free cash flow of $10 per share by 2020, he estimated.However, he cautioned it is ""too early to declare victory"" on the GTF ramp-up, from 138 in 2016 to 700-plus in 2018. United Tech fell short of its target for 200 GTF deliveries in 2016, he added, and more challenges could result in ""further penalties and potentially order cancellations,"" weighing on investor sentiment.Shares of United Tech closed up 0.3% at 130.45 on the stock market today, after rallying 1.5% Wednesday on the RBC note, which also upgraded the stock to outperform. The stock is out of proper buy range after breaking out from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry. GE rose 2.1%, Airbus jumped 2.5%, while Delta ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard  is a curated list of potential stock market winners.In his Wednesday note, McConnell also described United Tech's Rockwell Collins (COL) acquisition as a key free cash flow driver.""Rockwell Collins has among the stronger underlying outlooks of its commercial aerospace peers, driven by significant new content wins on next-generation platforms that position it well for the next five years,"" he said, while noting that the ""pricey"" $30 billion buy will likely deliver a return on investment in roughly five years.But the deal reportedly raised concerns from Airbus that it would keep United Tech from fixing the problems that delayed aircraft deliveries.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisCES 2018 News: The World's Largest Consumer Tech ShowQ4 Earnings Preview: Who Joins Facebook On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?

180,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) boosted F-35 delivery by more than 40% year-over-year to meet 2017 targets despite Pentagon warnings that the company would fall short.X On Friday, Lockheed delivered its 66th F-35 for the year vs. 46 in 2016, despite a fastener corrosion issue found in September that caused a 30-day suspension in deliveries.The Pentagon's contract management agency said earlier this year that Lockheed would only deliver 57 of the stealthy jets.""The team continues to overcome program challenges, and achieving this milestone gives our customers confidence that the F-35 enterprise can deliver on the increasing production quantities year-over-year,"" Lockheed F-35 Program General Manager Jeff Babione said in a release.Overall, the company has delivered more than 265 planes to U.S. and international customers and expects to hit full-rate production of 160 F-35s per year in 2023.Lockheed shares fell as low as 319, but closed down just 4 cents at 322.78 on the stock market today, staying in buy range after clearing a 322.29 flat-base buy point on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.While Lockheed plans to further ramp up F-35 production, the company said during its third-quarter conference call that F-35 sales growth this year is expected to be up 16% in dollar volume vs. 2016, with growth cooling to 13%-15% in 2018.More deliveries will also start going to international customers, which include NATO allies like Great Britain, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and Italy.Germany has requested F-35 information as it plans its own fighter upgrades but is exploring other options as well, like Boeing's (BA)F-15 and F/A-18E/F jets.RELATED: Lockheed's F-35: America's Stealthy Missile Defense Shield?

Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share.

183,LMT,"SpaceX successfully launched a used rocket and a used capsule for the first time Friday, in a mission for NASA that will ferry cargo to the International Space Station, as Elon Musk's company and Boeing (BA) look toward major milestones for the commercial space industry in 2018.X The launch, which took place on time at 10:36 a.m. ET, featured a previously flown Dragon cargo capsule and a previously flown Falcon 9 first-stage booster.The booster successfully landed back at Cape Canaveral roughly two and a half minutes after liftoff. The Dragon capsule is set to dock with the ISS on Sunday.SpaceX has recycled rockets as well as capsules before, but never on the same flight. For today's NASA mission, SpaceX used a Falcon 9 that was previously launched in June and a Dragon capsule that was previously used in April 2015.The mission was originally scheduled for Dec. 8 but was delayed to Dec. 12 before being pushed back to Dec. 13 and then Dec. 15 after particles were found in the second-stage fuel system.While the latest SpaceX launch was for NASA, its success could help the company win more contracts from the Pentagon, which is also looking at reusable rockets to help lower costs.At the Air Force Association's annual Air Space & Cyber conference in September, Gen. John Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, told reporters that reusable rockets were ""the way the industry is going. It's cost effective."" But he said the service needs to do a review to make sure they are safe.The Air Force hasn't been so open to the idea in the past. Just last year, the director of launch enterprise for Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center said it could be a ""long time"" before the Pentagon approves the use of a reusable rocket to launch national-security payloads.Boeing shares ended virtually unchanged at 293.94 on the stock market today, while Lockheed Martin (LMT) rallied 1.8% to 322.82, clearing a 322.29 buy point from a flat base. Boeing and Lockheed have a joint venture, United Launch Alliance, that provides launch services for the Pentagon.IBD'S TAKE: Investors can't get a piece of SpaceX or Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin yet. But you can discover other innovative companies on the IBD 50 list of top stocks. Friday's Falcon launch sets the stage for SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch.The new rocket, which SpaceX is touting as the most powerful operational rocket in the world, is set to launch from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., next month. But no sensitive NASA instruments will be on board. Musk tweeted earlier this month that the Heavy's first payload would be his midnight cherry Tesla (TSLA) Roadster playing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity.""The Heavy's first government payload, a GPS system, is scheduled for later next year.The next frontier for SpaceX is sending astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX and Boeing are scheduled to test manned capsules in 2018 with manned service missions to the ISS starting in 2019.Friday's SpaceX launch capped an eventful week for the commercial space industry.On Tuesday, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a reusable suborbital rocket from the company's Texas launch site. Bezos hopes to start offering commercial tourism rides on the New Shepard capsule in about 18 months.RELATED:Space Industry Booms On Wings — And Wallets — Of Billionaires Like Elon MuskWill SpaceX, Boeing See More Delays In ISS Launch Schedules?Boeing, Lockheed, Musk's SpaceX May Get A New Rival For Military WorkSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks

184,LMT,"The Air Force doesn't expect Boeing (BA) to deliver the first of its new KC-46 tankers until next year, despite assurances from Boeing that deliveries would start by the end of this year.After an annual risk assessment Tuesday, the Air Force predicted that the first delivery should come in late spring of 2018, while Boeing sees December of this year.""The top issues slowing progress are achieving the FAA airworthiness certifications and completing the flight test program,"" the Air Force said in an emailed statement Thursday.As recently as last month, Boeing management said the program is on track, with earlier woes finally behind it. On Monday, a Boeing spokesman said the company still plans to deliver the first tanker to the Air Force by the end of the year, adding that the risk assessment won't change that.The Air Force expects to have greater confidence in the delivery timeline in July, after Boeing receives final design approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration.Boeing shares closed up 1% at 189.93 on the stock market today, remaining in buy range.The tanker, which is based on a modified 767 air frame, is now in production but ran into delays for development of its refueling boom, wing-mounted air refueling pods, and wiring.And under the fixed-price contract, Boeing, not the taxpayer, is on the hook for all delays and cost overruns, which now exceed $2 billion.In February, Boeing CFO Greg Smith said only factory work remained on the tanker but also warned that new issues could come up during flight testing.The Air Force is anxious to get its new tanker as tensions heat up in the Pacific region, and new Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said Monday that the plane is among the service's top three priorities, with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 fighter and Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber.RELATED: How Boeing's Air Force Tanker Woes Are Helping Its Commercial Planes

On Monday, it advanced to close just shy of the buy point. The flat base formed just after completing a cup-with handle pattern.X The $17.2 billion fund, launched in March 2013, tracks the INDXX SuperDividend U.S. Low Volatility Index. As such, it invests in 50 of the biggest-yielding U.S. stocks. DIV offers an annualized yield of 6.4%, well ahead of the S&P 500's average payout of 1.9%.Utilities and real estate accounted for the two biggest sector weightings, at 25% and 24%, respectively. Consumer defensive and energy made up about 13% each, followed by consumer cyclicals at nearly 12%.Top holdings as of June 22 included H&R Block (HRB), Sturm Ruger (RGR), Armour Residential REIT (ARR) and Philip Morris International (PM), according to Morningstar Inc.

But those jets are no longer in service. Options for the sequel include the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 or the Super Hornet.The Pentagon hasn't been informed about which plane will be used in the movie, Philip Strub, director of entertainment media at the Pentagon, wrote in an email to IBD Friday. Earlier he wrote that the movie was still in the ""early stages of pre-production"" and that the DOD hasn't received a script yet.But analysts have some good guesses at which plane will take the leading role.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, said that the featured plane ""will almost certainly be the Super Hornet,"" citing logistics and availability of the F-35.Today, the Navy flies Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, while the service's variant the F-35 is slated to be combat ready sometime between 2018 and 2019. Tom Cruise, who played Maverick in the first movie, said filming for the new ""Top Gun"" movie is scheduled to start sometime next year.The timing could be tricky for producers of the sequel. The Super Hornet is in the fleet now but isn't the latest-generation fighter jet. The F-35 is a cutting-edge fighter with stealth technology but may not be combat ready in the Navy when filming starts.The Marines' F-35B reached initial operational capability in July 2015, and the Air Force's F-35A was declared combat ready in August 2016. But neither is designed to take off and land from aircraft carriers, which appeared in the original ""Top Gun.""""The F-35 is not really a Navy plane. It's a Marine and Air Force plane,"" Aboulafia said.If the Super Hornet is chosen, its appearance in the movie could be a factor in getting Boeing more orders for U.S. allies. And President Trump has suggested a ""big order"" for the fighter could be on the way.""As far as brand image, you can't beat what 'Top Gun' did for the F-14,"" Aboulafia said. But the F-14 wasn't exported; its only foreign sale was to the Shah of Iran.Without new Super Hornet or F-15 Eagle orders, Boeing faces the possibility of no longer making combat aircraft after it was shut out of the F-35 contract and lost the B-21 bomber bid to Northrop Grumman (NOC).Lockheed could use its own PR boost. The $400 billion F-35 program has been blasted for being over budget and behind schedule. But as the backbone of America's future fighter fleet, the Pentagon must start asking Congress for more and more procurement money as production ramps up, even as Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have piled on criticism.While Boeing's Super Hornet is the likely winner, Aboulafia said the jet is no F-14.The Super Hornet is ""a strike fighter vs. the ultimate machine to destroy everyone in the sky."" He said Lockheed's F-22 would be the more comparable jet to the F-14, but only the Air Force flies the newer stealthy jet.Boeing shares closed down 0.3% at 186.59 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares edged up 0.6%. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, edged up 0.2%. All three stocks are in buy range, though Lockheed is at the edge of the 5% chase zone.RELATED:Boeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

195,LMT,"Janus Henderson Forty Fund (JACAX) is about as hot as Kevin Durant was in the NBA Finals. That is, very!Thirty-two of the fund's 40 stocks had double-digit percentage gains so far this year going into June 14, according to Morningstar Inc. Three of those — electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and railroad CSX (CSX) — were up more than 50% for the year. As a result, going into Wednesday the fund's 19.38% year-to-date gain topped 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged 14.77%, and the S&P 500's 10.03% gain.The $751 million fund got more good news on Friday. Its No. 8 holding Amazon (AMZN) was up nearly 3% in the afternoon while the broad market measured by the S&P 500 was down roughly 1%. The Amazon boost reflected the market's thumbs-up vote in favor of the internet giant's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), which was announced in the morning. That put Amazon up 32% for the year. Investors appeared to believe that Amazon will be able to sweeten up Whole Foods' revenues and earnings.Thomson Reuters ranked the deal as Amazon's biggest of all time and the 11th biggest global retail deal ever.Already, the fund was outperforming 81% and 99% of its direct rivals over the past one and three years respectively. Lead manager Douglas Rao has been at the helm since June 1, 2013. Nick Schommer has been a manager since Jan. 12, 2016.The fund is growth oriented. And it is concentrated. True to its name, the fund limits its portfolio to its 40 best ideas. And, yes, that concentration can make the fund more volatile than its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.For example, in the fourth quarter the fund lost 1.47% vs. a 0.27% loss for the Russell bogey and a 3.82% gain by the S&P 500. The fund was hurt in part by the market's rotation away from the secular growth stocks it likes, toward companies with potential for improving cyclical prospects, the managers explain in their recent semiannual report. Cyclicals in energy, materials and industrials, for instance, benefited from the Trump Bump — a surge in bets on companies that could gain from increased spending on U.S. infrastructure.The fund's top performers have trended higher through the market's indecisive seesaw between cyclical and secular growth stocks in recent months.Look again at the fund's top performers. As IBD's Gillian Rich reported Tuesday, Tesla was upgraded to a buy at Berenberg and had its price target raised to 464 from 193. Despite efforts by BMW, Kia and General Motors (GM), analyst Alexander Haissl said no other automakers are currently building electric vehicles for the mass market that can compete with Tesla's offerings. The Model 3 is expected to go into production this year. Haissl also said the company's free-cash-flow potential is superior.Tesla is in IBD's Automobile Manufacturers industry group, which ranks No. 2 among 197 groups. Tesla closed at record highs in six of the eight trading sessions through Wednesday. Trading around 380, the stock is extended, outside its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.Also, some yellow caution flags are flapping around the stock's earnings. After posting a third-quarter profit, the company resumed losses the next two quarters, and the narrowing of the losses from year-earlier periods has slowed. And recent earnings-estimate revisions have been downward.Activision is also extended, trading in the high 50s. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Last month, Activision's first-quarter sales and earnings topped estimates. The company's Q2 revenue forecast topped expectations, but its EPS outlook was below analysts' views.CSX runs rail systems in 23 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. Its services include intermodal and rail-to-truck transload processes. Unlike those of Tesla and Activision, shares of CSX have slipped back into a buy range above their 50.41 entry.EPS grew 21% and 38% the past two quarters after four quarters of declines. Energy shipments and a stronger economy have boosted the rail firm's revenue.IBD'S TAKE: CSX ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail industry group. It has a 25.8% annual pretax margin. See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is another member of the IBD 50. Trading around 468, it has slipped back within a buy range from a 453.06 entry on a long cup base.EPS grew between 22% and 36% in each of the past four quarters. The drugmaker's Eylea macular degeneration treatment has been driving its growth. But that's not the only piston in Regeneron's engine. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges recently wrote to clients that Dupixent, an eczema treatment marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY), could easily outperform Wall Street models for the second quarter and for 2017 overall, IBD's Allison Gatlin has reported.Aerospace and defense stock General Dynamics (GD) is trading around 200, so it is still within buy range of a 194.10 buy point. EPS grew 7%, 9%, 9% and 19% the past four quarters.The company is positioned to benefit from President Trump's budget proposal, which would boost defense spending by 9.5% in fiscal 2018. And the company was one of several defense contractors — the others were Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) — that signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of last month's U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal.A merger between Janus Capital Group and U.K.-based Henderson Group closed May 30, creating Janus Henderson Group (JHG). Shareholders in what had been Janus funds should watch to see if the combined entity creates economies of scale that it can pass along in the form of lower mutual fund fees.Shareholders should also keep their eyes peeled for any manager departures from their funds. In some cases at other companies, veteran managers with ownership stakes cash out or leave. Some don't want to deal with culture clashes or fallout from corporate integration. Others are pushed out due to performance or cost cutting.The Janus-Henderson merger makes sense from a distribution viewpoint, since each asset manager has larger footprints in different geographic areas, according to Morningstar Inc.Both firms pared their fund lineups in the run-up to the merger. Janus merged two of its funds into other funds it ran (including Janus Twenty into Janus Henderson Forty) and one into a Henderson portfolio. It also closed one fund. Henderson made comparable moves. In addition, Janus Henderson is in the process of merging what had been two other Janus funds.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

196,LMT,"President Trump and Saudi Arabia praised Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot system for shooting down a Scud missile launched by the Houthi rebel group in Yemen last month. But a new report puts the Patriot's effectiveness in doubt.X Missile experts told the New York Times that it's likely none of the five Patriot defense batteries hit the Scud missile. Instead, the missile probably traveled over the missile defense system's interceptors and fell apart on its own, near Riyadh's airport.""You shoot five times at this missile and they all miss? That's shocking,"" Laura Grego, a missile expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the New York Times.

201,LMT,"President Trump's budget proposal would significantly hike research funds to develop a sixth-generation fighter that follows Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. But overall, there were few major changes in weapons procurement compared to the Obama administration's plans.The budget proposal, which also includes big tax cuts and substantial long-term curbs on Medicaid and food stamps, is seen as dead on arrival in Congress, but it still represents an opening offer from the Oval Office.The Pentagon's budget would grow to $574.5 billion in fiscal 2018, which starts in October, up 9.5% from what Congress appropriated this fiscal year. On top of that is $65 billion for the war-fighting fund, or the Overseas Contingency Operations account.Some of the increase in the Defense Department's baseline budget comes from Trump's plan to grow Army personnel by 26,000 active-duty troops. But the $115 billion for weapons procurement would largely be unchanged vs. what the Obama administration had planned for fiscal 2018.Quantities of big-ticket items like the F-35, Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and Boeing KC-46 tanker are the same, as well as the number of destroyers, submarines and other Navy ships.But the budget request is asking for $295 million for the Next-Generation Air Dominance Program, which would replace Boeing Super Hornets in the Navy and develop a follow-on to the F-35 in the Air Force. That's a massive increase from the prior projection of $13 million.Some $187 million also would be added to research for Lockheed's F-22, amounting to total funds of $610 million.The fiscal 2018 proposal also calls for $434 million in R&D funds for Air Force One, the aircraft that carries the president, but that amounts to a roughly $192 million reduction from the $626 million estimate for fiscal 2018.In the weeks after his election, Trump called the new Boeing Air Force One too expensive, and he has vowed to bring competition to the fighter-jet business and cut costs for the F-35, which he has said was ""way, way behind schedule and many billions of dollars above budget.""Research and development for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber would get a boost to $2 billion from $1.3 billion last year.Tens of thousand of missiles, bombs and related gear from Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are also in the budget plan, as the Pentagon seeks to replenish munitions stockpiles that have come down during the bombing campaign on ISIS targets.Lockheed Martin closed up 0.5% at 278.36 on the stock market today, holding above a 270 buy point. Boeing dipped 0.1% to 183.49, just below a 185.81 entry.

204,LMT,"Stocks racked up commendable gains in light trade Monday, hauling both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average further above their 50-day moving averages.The session opened boosted by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in long-term deals between U.S. manufacturers and Saudi Arabia, a set of bargains timed to correspond with President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia. The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit. Fields held the CEO seat for three years.

However, some of the deals were negotiated under the Obama administration, and many aren't finalized yet, with more negotiations needed.Lockheed said in a release that Saudi Arabia wants to buy more than $28 billion in ""integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs.""A letter of intent was singed with Saudi tech firm Taqnia to form a joint venture to support the completion of 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed has been eager to offer technology transfers and joint-venture opportunities to boost its market share overseas.

207,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew alongside older fighters from the U.S. and allied forces during its recent European deployment, providing the Air Force with new lessons on how the stealth jet can be supported and integrated with other forces.Pentagon officials envision ""fifth-generation"" F-35s and F-22s entering a battle space first to suppress any airborne or air-defense threats, allowing older, but more heavily armed ""fourth-generation"" fighters to follow.X Eight Air Force F-35A variants from the 34th Fighter Squadron deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia and Bulgaria as a show of force in the region and to test the procedures and logistics of moving the F-35 around the area.While the F-35 didn't fly with any Bulgarian or Estonian aircraft, they did train with U.S. Boeing (BA) F-15s stationed at Lakenheath and flew with British, Dutch and Norwegian Lockheed F-16s.The last of the F-35s returned to the U.S. on May 9, and officials from Hill Air Force Base offered more details Wednesday about the plane's first deployment to Europe.""We continue to learn again and again that the 5th gen is making our 4th gen more survivable, and the 4th gen makes us more lethal or deadly with their fire power,"" Lt. Col. George Watkins, the 34th Fighter Squadron commander, told reporters during a briefing.Here are some other takeaways:Lockheed shares were down 0.8% at 269.51 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, dipping below their 270 buy point amid a broad sell-off. United Technologies, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, dropped 1.6%, re-entering the high end of its buy zone. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.1% to 247.18 but still near a 249.53 entry.As tensions heat up in the region, Germany could be the next NATO ally to buy the F-35 outside current NATO partner countries like the U.K., the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and Italy.According to a Reuters report Wednesday, the German air force requested classified data on the F-35 as it looks to start replacing its older fourth-generation jets between 2025 and 2035. There are no plans yet for a procurement program from Berlin.The F-35 will attend the Paris Air Show next month, but Lockheed, not the Air Force, will get the plane over to the show.RELATED:The Brains For Lockheed's F-35 Just Got SmarterLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

209,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Top Air Force officials sounded skeptical about an airborne command and surveillance aircraft, saying late Thursday that it would meet less than 1% of requirements from commanders.XThe Air Force opened the competition late last year on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program to replace Northrop Grumman's (NOC) E-8. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop are leading teams with bids for the new aircraft.The service was supposed to make a decision last month on whether the $7 billion JSTARS program would go forward as planned. But the Air Force acknowledged in September that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches"" and sounded hesitant at a briefing Thursday afternoon.""JSTARS is battlefield management control. We are very serious about it. And because we are serious about it, we are evaluating how we do it,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said Thursday at the State of the Air Force presentation at the Pentagon.Wilson said the current system of one large plane with a radar system on its belly meets less than 5% of combatant commander's requirements. But the JSTARS replacement, also envisioned as a large plane, would meet less than 1% of requirements under current threats.The Boeing team is offering a modified version of its top selling 737-700 commercial jet, while Lockheed is working with a Bombardier Global 6000 business jet, and Northrop's offering is a modified Gulfstream G550 business jet.Top service officials have said an alternative approach to having a single aircraft would be to instead network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until a more survivable system is developed. Wilson echoed that stance at the briefing.The original E-8 ""was brought into service when I was on the national security staff in 1991, the start of the Persian Gulf War. Technology has changed since then,"" she said. ""Can we do this a different way by fusing that data (from multiple sensors) instead of relying on one aircraft? That's the question we are asking.""Northrop shares fell 0.3% on the stock market today. Lockheed rose a few cents, while Boeing lost 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.The Pentagon has sounded shaky about the current recapitalization program for several months.At the Air Force Association conference in September, Defense Secretary James Mattis noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission but didn't directly address the JSTARS program.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" he said.

Congress now has 30 days to approve the deal.Cahill said he couldn't say how much of the $15 billion deal would go specifically to Lockheed but that it was ""a very substantial sale"" for the company.After getting congressional approval, Saudi Arabia will then have to formally put in a contract for the system, but Cahill thinks that the deal will be done quickly.There is a ""sense of urgency on all parties.""Lockheed shares rose 0.1% to 317.71 on the stock market today, still in buy range from a 308.58 flat-base buy point.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.But Saudi Arabia also seems to be moving quickly on its deal for Russian system. On Monday, the Kremlin said that its own deal to sell Saudi Arabia the advanced S-400 system is progressing and wouldn't comment on whether Riyadh closing the THAAD deal would derail a deal for the S-400.U.S. NATO ally Turkey also has plans to buy the S-400 system instead of the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), which is jointly built by Lockheed as well as German and Italian defense companies.Saudi Arabia isn't the only country with increasing interest in missile defense.""The pace of inquiries, the depth of the inquiries and intensity are increasing month by month,"" Cahill said.Last week, Australia said it will outfit its new naval warships with Lockheed's Aegis air-defense system, which is also used by the U.S. and Japan and would help the three navies coordinate on missile-defense missions.Over the summer, Romania was cleared to buy seven Raytheon (RTN) Patriot missile defense systems. Lockheed builds PAC-3 interceptors for the system.Cahill said Lockheed is getting interest from countries that didn't have a high priority on missile defense in the past. ""If you're sitting anywhere in Europe you're interested in short-range defense after you saw what happened in Ukraine and Syria.""But as tensions heat up around the world, other countries are looking at more broad-range systems after recognizing that there are gaps in their capabilities.The U.S. is also focused on increasing missile defense at home. The Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs like Lockheed's Aegis systems, Raytheon's Cobra Dane surveillance radar, and Raytheon's Sea-Based X-Band radar, which floats on a Boeing (BA) platform.Raytheon dipped 0.2% to 187.69, near record highs and well extended from any buy point.

214,LMT,"The Kremlin said Monday that its deal to sell Saudi Arabia the advanced S-400 system is progressing despite the key U.S. ally getting approval to buy a Lockheed Martin (LMT) system Friday.XLate Friday, the State Department OK'd a possible $15 billion sale of 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launchers and 360 missiles from Lockheed. Congress still has to approve the deal.Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday that talks with Riyadh about buying its S-400 air-defense system were going well despite Saudi Arabia's THAAD order with the U.S.""We can speak only for ourselves,"" said Peskov. ""Contacts to implement this contract have been very positive and have had very good preliminary results.""U.S. NATO ally Turkey also has plans to buy the S-400 system instead of the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), which is jointly built by Lockheed as well as German and Italian defense companies.The Russian system's radar is considered especially dangerous to U.S. forces because it can spot a fourth-generation fighter — like Lockheed's F-16 or Boeing's (BA) F-15 and F/A-18 — before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system.Saudi Arabia typically buys its military hardware from the U.S. or the U.K., and the S-400 deal could signal a shift in politics as the kingdom needs Russia to support oil prices.Saudi Arabia's King Salman became the first sitting royal to visit the Kremlin last week as the two oil producers met to talk about continuing their current production pact and other investment deals.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

215,LMT,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly reached a deal to buy four Lockheed Martin (LMT) Littoral Combat Ships for $6 billion, as part of a $100 billion arms package that is expected to be finalized during President Trump's visit to the Middle East ally.The deal is expected to be announced Saturday, according to Bloomberg, when President Trump arrives in Riyadh. The ships had already been approved by the State Department in 2015 but the deal wasn't completed under President Obama.X A flurry of deals across the defense and energy sectors are expected during Trump's first presidential visit abroad.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of a massive $100 billion defense package as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly helped push the THAAD deal though by calling Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis, according to the New York Times.And a formal agreement for more Pac-3 Patriot missiles from Lockheed is expected as it has already been approved by Congress.Raytheon (RTN) is another big defense winner as Trump is expected to lift the Obama administration's hold on a $1 billion sale of  Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs.An order for 115 M1A2 General Dynamics (GD) tanks is expected to be finalized during the visit as well.Lockheed shares rose 2% to 272.76 on the stock market today, retaking a 270 buy point.

218,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew close to the Russia border last month as a show of force, but Pentagon officials said Monday they aren't concerned about adversaries obtaining any intelligence about it during the stealth fighter's public display.Several of the Air Force's F-35A variants were deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia, which borders Russia, and Bulgaria, which is across the Black Sea from Russian forces in Crimea, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, a program for placing U.S. forces in the region that began after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea.When asked about security issues related to flying the F-35 so close to Russia, Pleus said that while pilots are always nervous about adversaries gleaning information from the plane, the Pentagon has ""procedures available"" to prevent that from happening.""We have in place through a partner of networks proper procedures for us to make sure we can fly the airplane when we want to, in places that we want to, and that people cannot collect information off of the F-35,"" Brig. Gen. Scott L. Pleus, director at the F-35 Integration Office, told a group of reporters Monday.He wouldn't go into the types of procedures, saying they were classified.

219,LMT,"More than $100 billion in arms deals to Saudi Arabia, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system, could be announced later this week as President Trump visits the kingdom in his first foreign trip since taking office.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of the package, as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Littoral Combat Ships are also expected to be in the mix. Lockheed makes one version, and a partnership between Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) makes another.A $11.5 billion deal for four ships was approved by the State Department in 2015, but isn't yet in the final contract stage, according to Reuters sources.Many of the weapons had been part of an arms deal negotiated during the Obama administration but had yet to get the green light.For example, Obama had stopped the $1 billion sale last year of Raytheon (RTN) Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs due to concerns that the weapons would be used in Yemen.But Trump has been more supportive of arms sales to allies in the Middle East as the threat from Iran grows. On Thursday, the State Department approved the sale of Lockheed's Patriot PAC-3 missiles and Raytheon's GEM-T missiles to the United Arab Emirates. And in March, the State Department submitted a notice to Congress allowing sales of Lockheed F-16s to Bahrain.Lockheed shares edged up 0.4% to 272.36 on the stock market today. Lockheed is in buy range, above its 270 entry point. Raytheon shares were up 1% to 160.09, still above their entry point of 157.69. General Dynamics dipped 0.2% to 195.15, but remaining in buy range.Arms sales to Mideast allies have to be measured against Israel's capabilities, so that it retains weapons superiority in the region.In September, the Obama White House approved sales of Boeing (BA) and Lockheed fighter jets to Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, after the U.S. agreed to a $38 billion military aid package for Israel.Trump leaves for Saudi Arabia on May 19 and will also visit the Vatican, Israel and Brussels.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From Abroad

The report also said deals were expected with KBR Inc.

Lower oil prices have put a damper on the IPO, and the kingdom is looking at alternative means of revenue outside oil and gas to fund the government.Defense giants could also be big winners during Trump's visit, as more than $100 billion in arms sales are expected, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system and laser guided bombs from Raytheon (RTN).Lockheed shares fell 0.9% to 269.24, dropping just below a 270.10 buy point.

The so-called BFR, short for ""Big F***ing Rocket"" would be made from reusable components that would lower costs. Musk said that while some plans are still in the theoretical stage, he wants to start building the BFR in the next six to nine months.Private companies are investing heavily in larger rockets that would be powerful enough to send a crew to Mars. Blue Origin, founded by Amazon.com's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos, is working on its reusable New Glenn rocket.And it's not just rockets, companies are also building landers and crew living spaces for the long trip.Last week, Lockheed showed off a reusable Martian lander, built with technology used in the Orion spacecraft, as part of NASA's NextSTEP public-private partnership program to send people into deep space.And Boeing is developing the Space Launch System, which is expected to send vehicles to Mars as well as the moon.Boeing shares dipped 0.1% to close at 258.58 on the stock market today, edging back from the upper limit of their buy range. Lockheed ticked up 0.6%, also still in buying territory.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Still while companies are focused on Mars and beyond, some developments are being made for the moon.In June, Musk wrote a paper about why humans need to go to Mars and not the moon, saying Mars is bigger and has more resources. But then last month he showed off ""Moon Base Alpha"" in an Instagram post, which could be due to the administration's emphasis on the moon.The administration's push to return to the moon could have political motivations as Russia, China, and the European Space Agency are looking at lunar missions too.RELATED:SpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks NowThe Air Force's Skepticism On Reusable Rockets Is Fading Quickly

But the service and Northrop are also working on a plan to update the fleet's central computers and improve the radar to keep the plane flying until 2030, removing the urgency of the recap, IHS Janes reported.Some officials want to network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until industry develops a more survivable system.The Air Force acknowledged earlier this month that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches for battlefield command and control that could be more effective in high-threat environments,"" according to Defense News.At the Air Force Association conference last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission but didn't directly talk about the future of the program itself.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" Mattis said. ""I'm eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.""Georgia lawmakers wrote a letter to Mattis saying they would block any move to stop flying the current fleet without a replacement.""While the rationale has not yet been made known to us, canceling or delaying would be ill-advised and directly impact our combatant commanders who employ this asset in theater,"" Sen. Johnny Isakson, Sen. David Perdue, Rep. Austin Scott, Rep. Sanford Bishop and Rep.

224,LMT,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning after the major averages closed near session lows Monday.XThe top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell again. Several leading biotech stocks tested key levels as Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are all on tap with earnings this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures edged up a fraction.The Nasdaq composite led Monday's retreat, losing 0.6%, while the S&P 500 index fell 0.4% and Dow industrials 0.2%. The Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 1.1%, its ninth straight decline after hitting a 22-month high on Oct. 11. Even so, it's still rated No. 1 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Biogen reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday morning. Amgen and Vertex follow on Wednesday, while Celgene, Alexion and Gilead Sciences report Thursday.In addition to Biogen, a slew of big earnings report Tuesday, including McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Motors (GM) before the open.Biogen earnings rose nearly 21% to $6.31 a share as sales climbed 4% to $3.08 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $5.70 and revenue of $3.04 billion. Biogen is a leader in multiple sclerosis drugs and it has a new hit with Spinraza, the only spinal muscular atrophy drug on the market. But investors are also bullish on the prospects for aducanumab, which has indicated in early testing that it can reduce cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients.Biogen shares rose 1% before the market open on Tuesday. On Monday, the stock fell 2.8% to 328.55 in Monday's stock market trading, their third straight decline, and closed just above the 5% buy zone from a 312.50 entry initially cleared at the end of August.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Amgen, Vertex and Gilead Sciences fell below their 50-day moving averages on Monday. Amgen closed below an old 182.70 buy point for the first time since its Sept. 11 breakout. Amgen, Vertex and Gilead are in new flat bases.Vertex busted out in July on promising data on a new cystic fibrosis drug. Gilead Sciences is best known for its HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C drugs, but last week won FDA approval for its CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug, Yescarta, comes from Gilead's recent acquisition of Kite Pharma.Gilead earnings are expected to fall 24% to $2.08, as hepatitis C drug sales tumble. Amgen EPS is seen up 2% to $3.09. Vertex earnings are expected to go vertical, surging 131% to 37 cents.Celgene shares rose 0.9% on Monday, but that's after tumbling 10.8% on Friday. Celgene scrapped late-stage trials on a Crohn's disease treatment. Wall Street forecasts a 19% EPS gain to $1.88.Alexion retreated 2.75% on Monday, undercutting the low of its short flat base. Alexion dropped below its 50-day moving average on Friday.Alexion earnings are expected to rise 8% to $1.33.One popular way to avoid stock-specific risks in biotech is via ETFs. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) fell 1.2% to 327.74, dropping below their 50-day moving average and a 330 buy point cleared at the end of August.RELATED:2 Stocks In Buy Zones With Earnings Due: Investing Action PlanThe Big Picture: Nasdaq Adds 3rd Distribution Day In 4 SessionsBiogen Biomarkers Mark Way To Alzheimer's, Parkinson's TreatmentsCelgene Abandons Crohn's Drug; Could Others Take Its Spot?Does Gilead Now Have A New Multibillion-Dollar Franchise?6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

225,LMT,"Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine and Sierra Nevada-Embraer's (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano could get a chance to show off their abilities against the Islamic State or al-Qaida in a combat test next year, as the Air Force looks at possibly buying up to 300 relatively cheap, light-attack aircraft by 2022.XThe Air Force hasn't decided if light-attack planes will be an official acquisition program, but it experimented with the planes over the summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.The idea is save operating costs by flying the aircraft in uncontested environments and use sophisticated fighters like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet for more dangerous missions.A final decision on the test, dubbed Combat Dragon III, hasn't been made yet, but Air Force Reserve Col. Mike Pietrucha, light attack adviser to Air Combat Command, told Aviation Week that he is preparing to send two AT-6s and two A-29s.The test would take place in areas under U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, but the precise location decision would be determined by Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command.At the Air Force Association Conference last week, Harrigian said ""air superiority is job one,"" but once air superiority is assured, then a light-attack aircraft can be used.""I think the light attack would be able to provide me a lot of options, particularly if you're able to move closer to the forward line of the troops, provide the persistence that this type of platform will provide.""Textron shares rose 1.5% to 53.93, edging above buy range, and U.S.-listed shares of Brazil-based Embraer rallied 1.1% on the stock market today.  Boeing gained 0.6% and Lockheed added 0.2%, with both still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The price tag for the Super Tucano would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current unit cost of Lockheed's F-35. Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.The F-35 and Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet and would be needed in so-called contested environments against high-end rival planes from China and Russia.But will a light attack aircraft be enough force against terror groups in the Middle East?The AT-6 can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and be used for precision attack as well as surveillance missions.The Super Tucano can carry rockets, air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and is already in use by the fledgling Afghan Air Force. Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries also have the plane in their arsenals.RELATED:Air Force To Test Low-Cost Planes As Low-Tech Terror Groups TargetedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIBD Rating Upgrades: Textron Flashes Improved Technical Strength

227,LMT,"More testing delays with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter as well as postpone the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat ready next year, according to a Government Accountability Office report out Monday.The investigative arm of Congress estimates that problems with the development of the Block 3F mission-systems software will add another 12 months of testing and $1.7 billion to costs, with $1.3 billion of that needed in fiscal year 2018 for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase. The total procurement price tag is already at about $400 billion.Meanwhile, the Pentagon has lower estimates. The F-35 Joint Program Office sees a five-month delay and a $532 million cost overrun, and the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office inside the Office of the Secretary of Defense estimates another $1.1 billion will be needed to compete the development.""These delays could affect the start of the F-35's initial operational test and evaluation, postpone the Navy's initial operational capability, and delay the program's full-rate production decision, currently planned for April 2019,"" the GAO report found.But the Pentagon's Joint Program Office refuted the findings, saying the SDD testing phase will be completed in February with no impact to the Navy's or international partners' schedules to declare their variants combat ready.Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% at 276.21 on the stock market today.The report comes as President Donald Trump has been critical of the program's high costs. In February, he said he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets for the Navy.Unlike other acquisition programs, the F-35 is undergoing development and procurement at the same time instead of one after the other. And the prospect of additional development expenses comes as unit costs for the F-35 have been coming down — as successive production batches include larger quantities and factories hone manufacturing processes.The GAO report found improvements in Lockheed's manufacturing efficiency and quality as the number of defects and hours spent on repairs fell last year. Metrics on reliability and maintainability of the F-35 have also improved, the GAO said.But the GAO said the cost benefits of a bulk order aren't clear, as Lockheed and other contractors are still negotiating the contracts.Lockheed will report first quarter results early Tuesday, and Wall Street sees EPS rising 8.1%, to $2.79, and revenue up 8.3%, to $11.23 billion, on increased F-35 production.RELATED: Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth4 Defense Stocks In Or Near Buy Range Before Earnings Come OutBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

228,LMT,"President Trump agreed with the leaders of Mexico and Canada not to end Nafta ""at this time,"" the White House said late Wednesday, as they seek to move on renegotiating the free trade pact. Just hours earlier, Trump was mulling a withdrawal from Nafta, according to widespread reports, perhaps via an executive order announcing his intention.Canada's dollar and the Mexican peso jumped in overnight trading on the news.Trump has called Nafta the ""worst trade deal ever.""Here's the White House statement:""Late this afternoon, President Donald J. Trump spoke with both President Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada. Both conversations were pleasant and productive. President Trump agreed not to terminate NAFTA at this time and the leaders agreed to proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures, to enable the renegotiation of the NAFTA deal to the benefit of all three countries. President Trump said, 'it is my privilege to bring NAFTA up to date through renegotiation. It is an honor to deal with both President Peña Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau, and I believe that the end result will make all three countries stronger and better.'""Also Wednesday, the Trump administration announced a probe into aluminum imports for possible national security concerns that could be used to justify new protectionist measures. That follows a similar move regarding steel imports last week.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Century Aluminum (CENX) is the only U.S. maker of high-end aluminum for U.S. fighters such as the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 and the Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet. Century Aluminum shares rose 8.7% in the stock market today amid buzz of an aluminum probe. The company complained about subsidized Chinese aluminum products last year.Earlier this week, Trump announced plans to impose a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, a move that could raise the cost of a new home by more than $1,200, according to a trade group.RELATED:Trump's Lumber War Vs.

231,LMT,"Activist investor Third Point's proposal for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace division comes just as the industrial giant's new CEO, Darius Adamczyk, settles into the job, and the hedge fund's timing is ""intriguing,"" according to one analyst.Adamczyk became Honeywell's CEO and president this month, succeeding former CEO Dave Cote, who remains chairman. The change in management, RBC Capital said, could work in Third Point's favor.""New CEOs are often more willing to rethink an organization's portfolio,"" analyst Deane Dray said in a research note. ""But Dave Cote is still Chairman and we will have to see how much of a fight he will make now that his retirement process has been set in motion.""He also noted that the industrials sector is currently in an ""'urge to demerge' mode"" and that Honeywell could be the next illustration of a trend toward keeping it simple. He didn't name examples, but General Electric (GE) has largely shed its finance unit, and United Technologies (UTX) sold its Sikorsky unit to Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2015.""There are also lingering memories of (Honeywell's) high-profile United Technologies pursuit that was eventually abandoned in early-2016, which would have meaningfully increased the aerospace exposure of the combined company,"" Dray noted.Honeywell shares rose 1% to 131.13 on the stock market today, after hitting 135 intraday. GE, which has said it would tie bonuses to profit and cost-cutting targets amid pressure from Trian Fund Management, slipped 0.3%. United Tech edged up 0.15%.Honeywell has said it would review Third Point's plan to spin off the aerospace business, a move the hedge fund said could increase shareholder value by more than $20 billion.Third Point, in its first-quarter investor letter on Thursday, said Honeywell's aerospace business ""is the chief cause of Honeywell's discounted valuation"" and was better off on its own. The fund argued that the aerospace segment had not kept up with rivals and was the primary reason behind weaker earnings at Honeywell.Honeywell, which makes airplane engines and other aircraft parts, cut its full-year sales forecast in January, citing weaker demand in corporate jets amid global trepidation about the economy and less traction in defense.However, the company, a supplier of Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY), beat first-quarter earnings expectations last week. And Lockheed Martin said it expected more orders internationally for its F-35 jets, which use equipment provided by Honeywell.Third Point, which CNBC reported substantially added to its Honeywell stake, said that separating the aerospace segment would help turn Honeywell into ""an industrial growth company with a focus on automation and productivity.""Honeywell, in a statement Thursday, said ""we intend to take the time necessary to ensure a comprehensive, informed and objective review of the potential separation of the Aerospace business."" The company said that it will ""continue executing its 2017 plan.""""We have a strong portfolio of businesses with great positions in growing industries.

232,LMT,"Raytheon (RTN) said Thursday that heightened military operations in Syria are lifting the demand outlook for munitions, while more countries in Europe look to acquire its Patriot air-defense system.Shares of Raytheon got a boost after its Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.When asked during a conference call about prospects for a no-fly zone in Syria, Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said the ""tempo in Syria is pretty up right now,"" and the company is ""seeing significant demand signals to provide solutions and keep up with replenishment requirements.""Meanwhile, Poland is in contract negotiations with the U.S. government for Raytheon's Patriot system, and the deal, once closed, will net the company more than $4 billion.Also during the call, an analyst suggested that Romania is one of two other European countries considering the Patriot. Kennedy acknowledged that other countries in Europe are interested but declined to name them, saying only, ""We are obviously working with the U.S. government to expedite those as fast as possible.""On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) said it expects more missile defense orders from allies abroad.Shares of Raytheon were up 0.6% at 156.26 on the stock market today, paring gains and dipping back below its 157.69 buy point after clearing that threshold earlier in the day. Northrop Grumman (NOC) was up 0.1% at 248.40, also retreating from an entry point. General Dynamics (GD) added 0.1% to 195.03, still in a buy range, while Lockheed edged up 0.3%, also still in buy range.Raytheon's Q1 earnings from continuing operations jumped 21% to $1.173 a share, well above analyst views for $1.61 billion. Revenue rose 3.4% to $6 billion, also beating Wall Street views for $5.83 billion.Missile sales were up 2% to $1.76 billion. Sales of integrated defense systems, which include the Patriot, rose 5% to $1.4 billion, led by an early-warning radar. Sales of space and airborne systems climbed 8% to $1.6 billion, led by electronic warfare systems. Backlog at the end of the quarter was up 5.5% to $36.1 billion.Raytheon also lifted its guidance and now sees full-year EPS of $7.25 to $7.40, up from an earlier outlook of $7.20 to $7.35 but still largely below consensus of $7.40. It also expects full-year sales of $24.9 billion to $25.4 billion, up from a prior guidance of $24.8 billion to $25.3 billion and with the new midpoint above Wall Street views for $25.09 billion.While Raytheon's international bookings were up 14% in Q1, and international programs made up 41% of the backlog, it's also pursuing U.S. contracts and plans to compete for the Pentagon's Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) — an intercontinental ballistic missile program to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman missiles.Kennedy said Raytheon hasn't yet decided which contractor it will team up with for GBSD, which has an estimated cost of $62 billion over 30 years. The Air Force is expected to award preliminary contracts to bidders this year then narrow down to one prime contractor in 2020.

236,LMT,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) has racked up more than $2 billion in extra costs on the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, but the aerospace giant has learned key lessons from the military program's headaches and integrated them into its commercial aircraft business.The tanker, which is based on a modified 767 airframe, is now in production but ran into delays for development of its refueling boom, wing-mounted air refueling pods, and wiring. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company has used those lessons to help deliver the 737 Max ahead of schedule and under budget as well as get the 787-10 into flight testing a month early.""For the first time, we're building a military product, highly modified, in our commercial product line, and we see huge cost advantages to bringing that capability in line in our production models,"" Muilenburg said during the company's conference call. ""But around the edges of that, things like systems installation, wiring installation, the details that go into concurrently designing and building and how to do that most efficiently.""Lessons from the KC-46, which saw $120 million in extra costs in Q1, come as Boeing considers building a brand-new midrange plane dubbed the 797. Boeing has been under pressure to develop a new twin-aisle jet to grab market share back from Airbus and its A321neo jet.As a stopgap measure before the midrange jet launches, Boeing plans to extend its largest 737 Max to limit further losses to Airbus. The so-called 737 Max 10 could be unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June, sources told Reuters.Muilenburg didn't say Boeing's experience with the KC-46 would feed directly into the 797 and 737 Max 10 and declined to offer any details about them, such as the price tag, despite reports of carriers wanting a new plane at around $70 million-$75 million.

Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million a year ago.Boeing raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $9.20-$9.40, with the midpoint still below Wall Street views for $9.35, from an earlier outlook of $9.10-$9.30, due to a lower-than-expected tax rate.Muilenburg reiterated the company's stance on supporting tax reform and simplifying the tax code hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that President Trump's tax cut, with a 15% corporate tax rate, will be ""the biggest in history.""Muilenburg, who seems to have the president's ear on key issues, said Boeing has seen regulation improvements from the streamlining of defense contracting to improvements in the time it takes to get approval for foreign sales.On the defense side, Boeing has been pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to stay relevant in the defense air frame space as sales of its F-15 wind down and is in the race against Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the Air Force's T-X trainer contract.On Tuesday, Lockheed reported mixed Q1 results, and the F-35 maker lowered its full-year earnings outlook but slightly raised its revenue view. Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled to report Thursday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD), which both topped earnings estimates Wednesday, were little changed and up 0.9%, respectively.

237,LMT,"Dow Jones industrial component Boeing (BA) is expected to report bigger profits, but revenue is seen falling for a third straight quarter when the aerospace giant reports Q1 results Wednesday.Earnings are seen climbing 11.5% to $1.94 while revenue slips 5.9% to $21.3 billion, marking the fourth top-line drop in the last six quarters.While announcements for new orders grab headlines and point to demand, it's actual deliveries that put money in the coffers each quarter. Earlier this month, Boeing reported Q1 commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Deliveries of 737s dropped to 113 from 121 in 2016, and 777 deliveries dipped to 21 from 23. But the 787 Dreamliner saw an increase of two to 32.Shares rose 0.8% to 183.51 on the stock market today. Boeing is closing in on a 185.81 entry from a flat base and has been finding support at its 50-day line recently. But the stock had already broken out in January and October, and investors should be cautious about late-stage bases.Boeing already announced 198 net orders for Q1, vs. 121 in the year ago quarter, roughly around the 218 Q1 average from 2012-2016, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a client note.The aerospace giant's ""stock is not as correlated with order activity as it has been, so we do not believe near-term order activity (or lack of) will be significant for the stock,"" Herbert wrote.Still, Boeing has lost the order race to rival Airbus (EADSY) for the last four years and has cut over 1,300 engineering jobs since January 2016.On Friday, Boeing laid off ""hundreds"" of engineering employees at its Washington state factory after offering a round of voluntary layoffs in January, and more engineering cuts could be coming depending on the ""business environment"" and voluntary attrition.Boeing could give an update on a possible new clean-sheet design for a twin-aisle midrange jet to grab market share back from rival Airbus and its A321neo jet.On the defense side, Herbert sees revenue down 8% but believes sentiment on the stock has ""improved since the election and the initial negative headlines around pricing on Air Force One,"" which President Trump had earlier blasted for being too expensive.Meanwhile, Trump has been critical of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 over its high cost and said in February he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Boeing's Super Hornets.Boeing is pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to be more competitive vs. more advanced fifth generation fighters like the F-35.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) also report on Wednesday, and Raytheon's (RTN) results are slated for Thursday.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From AbroadDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth
"
238,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects more international orders for its F-35 fighter aircraft and the company's missile-defense system, as global tensions spur demand for U.S. military hardware.But the defense giant's stock retreated to its buy point following Lockheed's first-quarter sales miss and weak earnings guidance.During Lockheed's conference call Tuesday, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that 50% of F-35 orders over the next five years will be from international customers as Lockheed sees interest from countries outside the current program of record.Partner countries on the F-35 include the U.K., Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Turkey, Australia and Israel, among others. Last year, Lockheed said it was in talks with Spain, Belgium and Switzerland about selling them the F-35.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, and the company expects interest in THAAD from Middle Eastern customers.Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand in the Mideast and Asia. After the company landed big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan now plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland. Lockheed makes the PAC-3 missile for the Patriot system.Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years, and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies. A $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared, as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran.Hewson said Tuesday that Lockheed is continuing to look at opportunities to sell the F-16 abroad, especially to India, which could be a bigger buy than the Bahrain order. Shares of Lockheed fell 2.2% to 270.02 on the stock market today, trading just above and below a 270 buy point for much of the session, on mixed quarterly results and weak guidance.Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor and reports Wednesday, lost 0.4% to 248.13, just below a 249.53 buy pointutx. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines and also reports Wednesday, rose 0.5%.Lockheed reported adjusted EPS of $3, with revenue up 6.7% to $11.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.79 on revenue of $11.23 billion. Aeronautics sales, which include the F-35, jumped 8% to $4.1 billion. Rotary and Mission Systems sales, which include Sikorsky, edged up 2% to $3.1 billion. Missile sales rose to $1.49 billion while Space division sales climbed 12% to $2.36 billion.The company now sees full-year EPS of $12.15 to $12.45, below the Wall Street consensus for $12.64 and down from an earlier outlook of $12.25-$12.55, and sees sales of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for $50.18 billion and up from an earlier outlook of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion.In addition to foreign orders, Lockheed expects to reach a deal with the Pentagon for an 11th batch of F-35s, with a finalized contract expected in Q3.Lockheed started deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. The company is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.But as Lockheed looks to ramp up production, there are questions as to whether it will be able to meet its delivery goal of 66 jets this year. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg that Lockheed will likely only deliver 57 F-35s this year, as it's failed to meet its contract requirements since 2014. But Lockheed insists that it will meet its target of 66.Lockheed is also working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million currently. But Tanner said the lower cost won't negatively impact profit margins.But testing delays with the F-35 could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter as well as postpone the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat ready next year, according to a Government Accountability Office report out Monday. But the Pentagon offered lower estimates for cost growth and denied that there will be any impact on the Navy's or international partners' schedules to declare their variants combat ready.Lockheed is still bullish on its Sikorsky division, even though it didn't deliver a single commercial helicopter in Q1. Still, the company expects to finish the year delivering over 180 helicopters, in line with 2016 deliveries.In addition to Northrop, Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD) will report Wednesday, and Raytheon is scheduled for Thursday.RELATED: Dow's Boeing Nears Buy Point Ahead Of Q1 Results, But Revenue To DropLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

239,LMT,"XIt was another good day for the bulls in the stock market today as more bullish breakouts emerged.The Dow Jones industrial average was in the driver's seat, up 1.2%, helped by strong earnings reports from McDonald's (MCD), DuPont (DD) and Caterpillar (CAT). All three firms topped earnings and sales expectations, and Caterpillar broke out bullishly over a 99.56 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 showed gains of around 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index gained 1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels.Big gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included Netflix (NFLX), which jumped 6% on news of a licensing agreement with China-based Baidu (BIDU) to provide content on Baidu's iQiyi streaming video platform.Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG) also outperformed in the Nasdaq 100 with gains of 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Helped by solid earnings, Biogen gapped above its 50-day moving average as it approaches an early entry at 298.10. Celgene is closing in on a 127.74 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, China-based New Oriental Education (EDU) was a top performer, up 6%, after reporting strong earnings Monday. Wall Street liked the look of a big earnings beat and the second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth.Autohome (ATHM), also based in China, rose nearly 4%. It's back above the 50-day moving average as it works on a new base with a 36.11 buy point.Homebuilders had another rough go of it after lagging Monday's market gains. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped below the 50-day moving average, falling 4%. Among other things, Wall Street didn't like news that sales growth decelerated for the third straight quarter. Group peer D.R. Horton (DHI) is below its 50-day moving average after falling hard last week on earnings.Defense firm Lockheed Martin (LMT) paid a visit to its 50-day moving average as shares slumped nearly 3%.

240,LMT,"Acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo Ahn and U.S. Vice President Michael Pence said Monday that Seoul will deploy Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ahead of schedule as tensions with North Korea ramp up.The announcement follows key developments over the weekend related to the communist regime's missile program. A test of what some officials believe was a medium-range missile failed, but an earlier military parade in Pyongyang appeared to show off new types of long-range missiles.""North Korea would do well not to test his resolve,"" Pence said of President Trump in a joint news conference during the vice president's visit to South Korea, ""or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region.""THAAD's deployment, which is controversial in South Korea and is opposed by China and Russia, was originally scheduled for later this year. But components started to arrive in March following prior missile tests in North Korea. Neither Pence nor Hwang gave a specific timeline Monday for its accelerated deployment.The decision to deploy THAAD was made last year under President Obama and South Korea's then-President Park Geun-hye, who has since resigned and was formally indicted Monday over an influence-peddling scandal.Meanwhile, Japan is looking to update its missile defense system. It has money earmarked to upgrade its PAC-3 Patriot batteries, made by Mitsubishi and Raytheon (RTN), and also is considering the THAAD system.Lockheed shares rose 0.7% to 269.88 on the stock market today, just below a 270 buy point. Raytheon shares edged up 1% to 153.24. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares were up 1.2% to 243.10. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 1.9% to 179.02, rebounding from their 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise since President Trump took office on promises to expand the military's budget. Many top stocks are forming bases and bouncing in and out of buy range. But the policy in Seoul on North Korea could be reversed under a new administration. A presidential election to replace Park will be held by May 9.The South Korean Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in is leading the polls, and the former human rights lawyer has taken a less hawkish stance on Pyongyang.RELATED: Lockheed Stock Hits Buy Point After Trump Reverses This Obama MoveBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

241,LMT,"Just as Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) is disrupting the auto industry, his SpaceX venture could upset a commercial air travel industry currently dominated by Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY), Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).XLate Thursday, Musk announced plans to build a new megarocket that could travel to Mars, the moon and in Earth orbit. But the so-called BFR, short for ""Big F***ing Rocket,"" would also be able to take travelers anywhere on the planet in ""under an hour"" for the same cost as a plane ticket, he said.Making his presentation Friday at the International Aeronautical Congress in Australia, Musk said the BFR would take passengers into low Earth orbit before offloading them on landing pads, similar to the floating drones the company uses to land its reusable Falcon 9 rockets. That could cut travel time from London to Dubai from 7 hours to just 29 minutes.The BFR would be 122 meters tall, about double the height of the Falcon 9, and could have up to six times the number of engines as the Falcon 9. While still in the theoretical stage, Musk said he wants to start building the BFR in the next six to nine months.Boeing shares fell 6 cents to 254.21 on the stock market today but still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 246.59 buy point two weeks ago. Airbus' U.S.-listed shares rose 0.9%, American Air was flat, United lost 0.5%, and Delta slipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But SpaceX isn't the only one looking at faster commercial travel.NASA is working with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) secretive Skunk Works division on a supersonic jet that reduces the sonic boom so it could fly over crowded cities.In addition, the military is working on hypersonic weapons that fly over five times the speed of sound, and the propulsion technology could have applications for commercial passenger flight, but those are a few decades away.Still the technology would only cut travel time from the U.S. to Tokyo to three hours vs. over 12 hours on a current commercial flight.Meanwhile, both Lockheed and SpaceX have their sights set on Mars as a new space race heats up.RELATED:The Air Force's Skepticism On Reusable Rockets Is Fading QuicklySpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks Now

242,LMT,"Weapons made by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) could get new infusions of money, as the Pentagon looks for ways to accelerate U.S. defenses amid rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear and missile threats.XThe Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs, some of which are classified, from Army and Army Reserve operations and maintenance accounts, according to a Sept. 7 request obtained by Defense News.The programs poised to get more funding include upgrades to Lockheed's shipboard Aegis systems, so they can launch Raytheon's Standard Missile-3 Block IIA, Raytheon's Cobra Dane surveillance radar, and Raytheon's sea-based X-band radar, which floats on a Boeing platform.The Pentagon also wants to boost the number of ground-based interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska, to 64 from 44 and add 20 missile silos. Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is located there.At a recent Capitol Hill hearing, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford alluded to the spending-transfer request, and said, ""We looked at additional radar systems. We looked at THAAD systems, Patriot systems.""Lockheed makes the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and Raytheon makes the Patriot air-defense system.Lockheed shares were down 0.3% at 309.19 on the stock market today, but still above a flat-base 308.58 buy point. Raytheon slipped 0.3% but remains well above buying territory. Boeing was off 0.4%, staying in its buy zone.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.As money flows toward missile defense, more defense contracts are trying to get in on the action.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced it would buy Orbital ATK (OA) for $9.2 billion.In addition to making rocket boosters and munitions, Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system.

246,LMT,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite signaled modest gains early Tuesday as the major market averages look set to hold and extend Monday's big gains.Dow components McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) report earnings before the open, along with Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Pulte Group (PHM). All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday. (CVS Health (CVS), which is a major PBM in addition to its drugstore operations, was up 3% late, perhaps on hopes that it will win the Anthem business.)On Monday, the Nasdaq composite soared 1.2%, hitting an all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 index rose 1.1%, both retaking their 50-day moving averages.

Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion. On Monday, Caterpillar reported that equipment sales by retailers rose 1% in the three months to March vs. a year earlier, the first such gain since November 2012.Caterpillar shares rose 2.6%, to 96.81, on Monday, retaking their 50-day line and approaching a 99.56 flat-base buy point.The defense contractor should report an 8% revenue rise to $1.24 billion with EPS also up 8%, to $2.79. Lockheed Martin rose 1.1%, to 276.21, on Monday, still in range from a 270 buy point retaken last week.Defense stocks have rallied on hopes for higher U.S. military spending and increased geopolitical tensions with Syria and North Korea. Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) as well as Boeing (BA) report later this week. All of those stocks are in or near buy points as well.The homebuilder is expected to report a 21% EPS rise to 29 cents on a 22% revenue rise. Shares are technically in buy range, but only because of three high-volume declines in a row, sparked by concerns over guidance from fellow builder D.R.

248,LMT,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — Boeing (BA) touted an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet's increased stealth and additional weapons payload Tuesday as it looks to remain a key component in the Navy's fleet until the 2040s.The push comes at a delicate time as the Pentagon reviews Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 program due to its growing costs and after President Trump said in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of  Super Hornets.Both companies point out certain advantages each aircraft has but hesitate to make head-to-head comparisons, especially given that the F-35 is considered a 5th generation fighter with stealth and advanced avionics while the Super Hornet is a 4th generation fighter without the same stealth capabilities.A proposed Block 3 version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long range infrared search and track system and a deeper magazine to hold more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant, said Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, at the Navy League's annual Sea Air Space conference Tuesday.Boeing is also looking at improving the Super Hornet's stealth by applying a special radar-evading coating and removing the fuel tanks under the wings to reduce its profile.Meanwhile, the view from Lockheed is that the F-35 can help coordinate between platforms and share information, like incoming threats, while the Super Hornets could provide increased firepower, said Jack Crisler, the company's VP of F-35 business development and strategy integration.""It's the ability to take all the sensors integrated into the aircraft — we don't have pods or external antennas, that's all internal — take all the information and fuse it together and make the pilot a strategist as opposed to a technician or sensor operator,"" he told reporters.Boeing shares closed up 1.2% at 178.70 on the stock market today. Lockheed edged up 0.3% to finish at 269.56.Despite any jockeying for additional orders, one plane will not displace the other as they are expected to fly together. In the future, each Navy carrier is slated to hold two F-35 squadrons and two Super Hornet squadrons.At a House Armed Forces subcommittee hearing last week, Adm. DeWolfe Miller, the Navy's director of the Air Warfare Division, said that ""the carrier air wing of the future needs both 4th and 5th generation capability.""RELATED: Lockheed Not Bothered By Trump's Call With Boeing CEO, F-35 ChiefLockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North Threatens

249,LMT,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

251,LMT,"The U.S. military's late Thursday airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks including Raytheon (RTN), which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea.Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million and the weapon was first used in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Raytheon also makes the Patriot ground-based air defense system.Raytheon surged 3% before paring its gain by half, but closed above its 50-day moving average and a 152.68 flat-base buy point. That put the stock back in buy range.Among other aerospace/defense stocks, Lockheed Martin (LMT) also reclaimed a buy point as it finished 1.2% higher to just above the 270 entry. Lockheed makes the Paveway II Plus laser guided bomb. Northrop Grumman (NOC) added 0.9%, but hit resistance at its 50-day line as it builds a handle on a cup base with a 249.53 entry.Dow component Boeing (BA), which makes joint direct attack munitions kits that turn dumb bombs into smart weapons, edged 0.8% higher as it shapes a flat base with a 185.81 buy point.

The sector has risen more than 5% since the start of the year. The aerospace/defense industry group, up 0.7% Friday, soared 19% from the Nov. 8 presidential election to its March 1 peak. It's still up about 14%.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been rallying since President Trump's election as he pushes for a $54 billion increase in military spending.President Trump said the missile strikes were in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces that killed at least 70 people earlier in the week.While the strikes were the first direct targeting of Assad's forces by Washington, the U.S. dropped over 12,000 bombs targeting the Islamic State and other militants in Syria last year, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report citing Defense Department data.RELATED: Lockheed Stock Hits Buy Point After Trump Reverses This Obama Move

253,LMT,"The capabilities in Boeing's (BA) bid for the Air Force's trainer jet program are ""more robust"" than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) offering, an analyst says, but affordability will likely play a ""heavy hand"" in the Pentagon's decision.The race between the two top contractors is too close to call, as both ""aircraft meet, if not exceed the bid specifications, with the capabilities of the Boeing aircraft somewhat more robust than those of (Lockheed's) T-50A,"" Moody's analyst Jonathan Root said in a note to clients late Wednesday.""We believe (Boeing's) all-digital cockpit has great flexibility from a trainer standpoint. It can pull up cockpits from the Raptor and F-35,"" Root said in an interview with Investor's Business Daily.Root said it was unclear if Lockheed's offering had a digital cockpit or if its cockpit has the flexibility to fully become another plane like the F-22 or F-35.Lockheed's operational T-50A, along with Boeing and partner Saab's clean sheet T-X bid, are the clear front-runners in the contest that saw early leader Northrop Grumman (NOC) drop out and Raytheon (RTN) end its bid with Italy's Leonardo earlier this year. Leonardo has since decided to enter a bid on its own, and Sierra Nevada along with Turkish Aerospace Industries are submitting their ""Freedom Trainer"" option.Boeing shares ticked up 0.2% to 177.37 at the close on the stock market today. Lockheed was up marginally to 267.11. Raytheon ticked up 0.5% to 150.75. Northrop shares ticked up 0.2% to 236.67.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been flying high after President Trump vowed to expand military spending, and Boeing could get another boost from Trump's proposed border tax.While Boeing might have new capabilities on its side, Lockheed's offering has been flying successfully in South Korea since 2002, and last month Lockheed executives told reporters that the T-50A could be delivered to the Air Force in 2022, two years ahead of schedule.But Boeing is expected to push hard for its clean sheet design as it looks to stay in the defense airframe business after losing contests for the F-35 and the B-21 bomber.""They are two very viable contestants and both will do the job. It's going to come down to these two issues — affordability and the desire to have a more diversified vendor base,"" Root said.The contract, estimated at $16 billion for the initial 350 aircraft, will be awarded later this year.RELATED: Air Force Will Seek Proposals For Low-Cost Attack Plane ExperimentBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

261,LMT,"As tensions rise with North Korea, which is reportedly able to put nuclear weapons on ballistic missiles that can reach the U.S., America's missile defense systems may be put to the test.But there is no single system. Instead, different systems are designed to intercept warheads at various stages. Here are how some of them work:The Patriot first gained popularity for success against Iraq's Scud missiles during the first Gulf War. Raytheon (RTN) makes the system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor missiles.The system is useful against conventional weapons. It has a range of just 12 miles and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.But a key vulnerability of defenses like the Patriot is that nuclear missiles will deliver multiple warheads and decoys, unlike conventional missiles.""When you're dealing with nuclear, you can't just deal with half, you have to get them all,"" said Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase. The system has a range of 124 miles and can intercept missiles both inside and right outside the Earth's atmosphere.
"
262,LMT,"The THAAD system is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska. Last month, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency announced that its THAAD system in Kodiak, Alaska, successfully intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time in a test. So far, the system has a perfect 14-out-of-14 record in tests since 2005.The ship-based Aeigs system can protect against short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during the midflight or terminal stages, and its powerful long-range radar can be used to help improve the accuracy of the Patriot or THAAD. The Aegis can also hit land-based targets, submarines and surface shipsCurrently, there are 84 U.S. Navy ships in service with the weapons system, while Japan and South Korea are in the process of updating their Aegis systems. There is also an onshore variant set to be deployed in Romania and Poland.Boeing's (BA) Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in midcourse flight.But so far tests have been spotty. In May, the antimissile system was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and successfully intercepted a target ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands. It was the 10th successful test in 18 attempts, but prior tests have failed, including two tests in 2010 that were carefully scripted with the dimensions, trajectory and speed as known factors.""Missile defense has taken on a mythical quality right now,"" Collina said. ""They aren't testing the stressful stuff. So they still won't tell you if it works in a real-world situation.""Defenses that target missiles while they are still climbing — before any decoys or countermeasures are released — could in theory get around the problem of decoys and other countermeasures. But a current U.S. boost-phase capability hasn't been fielded.Laura Grego, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the Air Force looked into using a laser that's mounted in a Boeing 747 — to shoot down missiles in their boost phase — but the plan was scrapped for being too expensive. Drones could do the same job, but Grego said she isn't sure the technology is ready.""I think we need to move to boost phase,"" she said. ""The problem with boost phase is that you only have a few minutes (to react), so you have to be close by. So China and Russia could just move launchpads into the interior of the country so you'll never get close enough.""RELATED:Raytheon Hits New High As Latest N.

Those missiles were initially fielded in the early 1980s.The LRSO is meant to hit targets from long ranges without putting bombers at risk of getting shot down. But critics have charged that the Pentagon doesn't need the LRSO as the B-21 is supposed to be stealthy enough to elude enemy air defenses.Lockheed and Raytheon each received $900 million contracts to develop the technologies for the LRSO and demonstrate the new weapon's reliability, the Air Force announced late Monday. The service will then pick one company to manufacture the LRSO, whose cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.The Air Force plans to start fielding the next-generation nuclear cruise missile in the late 2020s.

North Korea's nuclear program has placed greater urgency on missile defense technology. Passenger jet manufacturers and their suppliers enjoy a long backlog of orders for new-generation planes.Against that backdrop, it's little surprise that iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) ETF is trading near record highs.

But the troop buildup also means Trump won't withdraw U.S. troops and produce a huge negative for companies.""If Trump had decided to scale back U.S. commitment and withdrawal, those engaged with Afghan security forces couldn't stay there,"" Hunter told IBD.Makers of ground vehicles, like General Dynamics (GD), could get a boost — as well as the companies that help maintain vehicles for the Afghan military.Sales of the low-cost A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions, could also get a boost, Hunter added.The plane's performance in Afghanistan could have implications for the U.S. arsenal too. The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 low-cost attack aircraft by 2022, to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The Super Tucano, made jointly by privately held Sierra Nevada and Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), is participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment with light-attack aircraft, along with the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).U.S. and South Korea forces will conduct previously scheduled joint military exercises this week despite pressure from North Korea and China to cancel the event.The war games could prompt North Korea to ratchet up pressure again, after pulling back from its threats to launch missiles toward Guam.Hunter said missile defense spending would have to increase to meet the short-term demands of more intercepts in addition to longer-term R&D, noting that the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo last week that put missile defense at the top of its R&D priorities list.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is currently deployed outside Seoul, and Boeing (BA) is the prime on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system used to protect the U.S.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works Late Sunday, the USS John S.

But it hasn't given an estimate for the total acquisition cost, saying U.S. adversaries could infer the plane's capabilities with such figures. Meanwhile, analysts have put the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has been critical of the program's secrecy, especially regarding its cost, as taxpayers are on the hook for any overruns under Northrop's cost-plus contract.Bunch promised senators at the hearing that the Air Force is ""committed to complete transparency with the appropriately cleared individuals of the defense committees"" and is balancing what it can give out to the public with the need for security.RELATED: Trump Waives Human Rights Condition On F-16 Jet Sale to BahrainWhat The Air Force Chief Said In His 5 Minutes With Trump

Boeing retreated 1.9%.Analysts have said Lockheed is the likely front-runner in the trainer contest, after Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) bowed out of the competition for the $16.3 billion, 350-aircraft contract.But even if Lockheed loses the U.S. Air Force's contest, Weiss said the T-50A offering also has potential in overseas markets, estimating that the total worldwide market could be 1,000-2,000 aircraft, including the 350 planes the Air Force plans to buy.RELATED: Lockheed Not Bothered By Trump's Call With Boeing CEO, F-35 Chief

""What that means is essentially more of a reliance on drone strikes and on raids and less of a reliance on troops as a stability presence.""While the stealth fighter isn't deployed in Afghanistan, Trump's seeming commitment to the war there could good long-term news for the F-35, which has high-end sensors that can act like a linchpin guiding other air and ground forces as well as drop bombs and support raids, Lohaus said.Trump's policy is also good for munition makers like Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA), whose Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kit, which turns ""dumb"" bombs ""smart.""Lohaus also said to expect more major munition drops like the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, which was used earlier this year in Afghanistan.Lockheed shares closed up 1% at 304.80 on the stock market today, Boeing added 1.7%, and Raytheon gained 1.4%.Helicopters are used to ferry troops and supplies as well as provide air cover.

277,LMT,"The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 cheap light-attack aircraft by 2022 to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The service is conducting tests this month at the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, looking at the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine, the A-29 Super Tucano from Sierra Nevada Corp. and Embraer (ERJ), and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).Lockheed Martin (LMT)  deemed its T-50A, its offering for the trainer competition, too high tech for the light-attack experiment.The Scorpion jet costs $20 million per unit and $3,000 per flight hour. In comparison, the aging A-10 costs over $17,000 per flight hour.The Scorpion can carry more weapons than its competitors and could be used for everything from close air support to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), according to Textron. But while the plane first flew in 2013, it still doesn't have its first customer and Textron withdrew the plane from the Air Force's T-X trainer competition.The turboprop has familiarity on its side as it's based off the Texan II trainer already in use by the Air Force. The AT-6 can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and be used for precision attack and ISR missions.The turbo prop costs $10 million to $14 million depending on the configuration, with a per-flight-hour cost of around $500.  The Super Tucano is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterroism missions and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The plane can carry munitions from rockets to air-to-air missiles to laser-guided bombs.The plane failed to meet the experiment's requirements to have a pressurized cockpit and ejection seat but was still invited to attend.So far the planes have performed in both day and night tests and have flown with and without weapons.""That data is intended to inform strategic decisions,"" Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said to visiting reporters last week, according to Defense News. ""It will also tell us whether we take this to the next step.""A next step might mean a mission in a real combat zone, such as Iraq, to test the planes' attack and ISR capabilities and ability to land on primitive forward runways  in a permissive environment.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksWhy This Cold War-Era Spy Legend Could Last More Than 100 Years

280,LMT,"REDONDO BEACH, Calif. — Northrop Grumman (NOC) and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which will be launched next year, will probe deeper and see more than its predecessor, the Hubble.XLockheed Martin's (LMT)Hubble has returned mind-blowing images of black holes and nebulae since its launch in 1990 while producing breakthroughs in how we understand the universe, but researchers needed a more advanced system to probe further into space, especially to see how early stars and galaxies formed.""NASA wanted something that answered two questions: Are we alone in the universe and where did we come from?"" said Scott Willoughby, telescope program manager for Webb prime contractor Northrop, in a recent interview.The Webb telescope will be 100 times more sensitive than the Hubble, thanks to its 18 hexagonal mirrors, built by Ball Aerospace. Each mirror is over four feet across, forming a primary mirror 21.3 feet across. Hubble's primary mirror is just under eight feet across.The Webb telescope can also fix itself, unlike the Hubble, which required astronauts to fix the focus it a few years after launching in 1990. But because the Webb will be a million miles from Earth vs. the Hubble's 300-mile distance, a similar repair job won't be possible.Willoughby said the Webb has seven motors on its mirrors to ""change the prescription"" of the lenses and it takes just seconds to move the mirrors and change the focus.And unlike the Hubble, the Webb will capture infrared light, as its giant mirrors will be protected from picking up heat and light from the sun.Northrop built five massive sun shields from Kapton, a film made by Dupont (DD) that won't distort in the extreme cold of outer space.""The material has been used on smaller applications, but this is the first time it will be used as a giant umbrella application,"" Willoughby said.The price tag on Webb telescope also tops the Hubble's. The total estimated life cycle cost for the new telescope is $8.8 billion, which includes the operating costs for the first five years and for two years of data analysis, according to NASA. The Hubble's initial costs along with five years of operation and data analysis costs amount to $7.5 billion in today's dollars.Shares of Northrop were down 0.2% on the stock market today but still above buy range. Webb subcontractors Orbital ATK (OA) and Harris (HRS) were down 1.4% and 0.2%, respectivelyIBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon are already past their buy points. But fastener distributor and logistics services leader KLX could be ready to break out. On Monday, Northrop said that all five of the telescope's sun shield layers have been installed and fully integrated, and the company is now folding the 70-by-40-foot sheets to fit into an Ariane 5 rocket in time for deployment tests scheduled for later this month.The telescope is scheduled for an October 2018 launch from French Guiana. It will take six months for the telescope to unfurl its sun shields and mirrors, calibrate its instruments, cool down and reach its destination. Then the research can begin.One of the first missions will be taking a closer look at three planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, which was discovered last year and could have the right conditions to support life.RELATED: The B-2 Maker Is Also A Stealth Chip Giant And Competes Commercially

281,LMT,"PALMDALE, Calif. — With new sensors and airframe upgrades, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) legendary U-2 spy plane could stay flying for another 40 years or more, which would mark a century of secret reconnaissance from the program.XThe U-2, nicknamed ""The Dragon Lady,"" first flew in 1955 and for decades took photos over war zones and enemy airspace. The Air Force had plans to retire the program in 2019 to save money, but then changed its mind as demand for battlefield intelligence surged during the U.S. campaign against ISIS.The U-2 aircraft in service now were built in the mid-1980s and have about 15,000-16,000 flight hours on them, a fifth of the 75,000 total hours that the planes were designed to withstand, Kyle Franklin, Lockheed's U-2 program director, told IBD at the company's secretive Skunk Works facility""It's an old program,"" he said in an interview. ""But 85% of the life cycle is still left in it.""To keep the high flying spy planes in airworthy shape, Lockheed completely takes apart the U-2 every seven years and rebuilds it to conduct structural inspections and do preventative maintenance.No new U-2 planes are expected to be built, but Franklin is ""confident"" that the existing ones could be flown through the 2040s and could even be ""fielded to 2060 and beyond.""Lockheed shares were down 0.1% at 296.78 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, but still above buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed stock is extended out of buy range, but you can find other top stocks near a buy range among IBD's review screens that sort out stocks poised for a breakout and give detailed chart analysis.Before the U.S. spied on adversaries with satellites in space, there was the U-2, which flies at the edge of space at 70,000 fleet, twice the elevation of commercial airliners. Pilots wear a specialized flight suit that resembles something astronauts wear in space and during long missions eat food, such as caffeinated pudding, out of a tube.During the Cold War, U-2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down over Russia in 1960, then pictures taken on a U-2 mission two years later sparked the Cuban Missile Crisis. The plane was also used in the Vietnam War, and during the first Gulf War it monitored Iraqi troop movements and the location of Scud missiles.Today, U-2s look for IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan and are also used by NASA to track weather data and can be deployed as part of peacetime rescue operations.As the plane's missions evolved, updates were needed. In the 1990s, it was outfitted with new engines. And in the early 2000s, pilots got an updated cockpit that lowered the cabin pressure from that experienced at 30,000 feet, which is roughly the height of Mt. Everest, to the equivalent of 15,000 feet.The latest improvement for the venerable U-2 is smaller, updated sensors, allowing the plane to hold more reconnaissance technology. Lockheed declined to offer more detail.Next year, Lockheed will start test-flying the U-2 with Raytheon's (RTN) updated ASARS-2B radar system, which has increased detection ranges and improved image quality vs. prior versions.Mark Cole, Lockheed's director of business development at the Skunk Works and a former U-2 pilot, said as new technology enables sensors to get smaller, more of them can go on the plane.""As the sensor technology matures, you can put more technology on it,"" he said.The U-2 is also being modernized to meet the Air Force's goal of Open Mission Systems, which is meant to make subsequent updates quicker and cheaper.Lockheed is currently working with the Air Force to figure out a road map and budget guideline for the U-2, and that should be completed sometime this quarter.But don't expect an unmanned system as a future update for the U-2.""We revisit it every 10 years or so,"" Franklin said. ""It can be done, but is it solving a problem? For some of our missions, a man in the loop is very important.""Cole called Northrop Grumman's (NOC) Global Hawk a ""complementing system"" and said that ""the U-2 can do stuff the Global Hawk can't.""RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

284,LMT,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range.

289,LMT,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

291,LMT,"The Trump administration is set to unveil a budget proposal in the coming week that will offer additional details about defense spending, making Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX), General Dynamics (GD) and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) stocks to watch.The budget plan, which could be released Thursday, follows a broad outline last month that called for a $54 billion hike in defense spending but didn't specify what programs would benefit. It also didn't say how dollars would be split between new weapons, which would help the Lockheed Martins of the world, and personnel costs like uniforms, medical care and housing.During his campaign, Trump called for adding 78 ships to the Navy, at least 100 aircraft to the Air Force, and tens of thousands of troops to the Army and Marines. He has also backed efforts to recapitalize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, as Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and other defense contractors turn their sights to nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Lockheed Martin — which makes the F-35 stealth fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, missiles, and the littoral combat ship — has been trying to clear a cup base with a 270 buy point. Shares ended Friday at 268.66.The Pentagon's top supplier has taken some flak recently. Trump has said he wants to introduce competition into the business of building fighter jets, saying costs for the F-35 were ""out of control"" and that he wanted Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."" But such a shift would require a new competition and wouldn't show up in the upcoming budget. Meanwhile, Lockheed has been cutting costs on the F-35, with the latest production contract factoring in unit cost reductions of 7%-8%.

292,LMT,"Northrop Grumman spun off its shipbuilding operations in 2011, but it is developing the B-21 bomber, which could be worth $80 billion, and makes the Global Hawk drone.Northrop is also a major subcontractor on the F-35, making the center fuselage, fire control radar, and the communications and navigation system, while also helping develop the mission system and mission planning software.Other contracts are up for grabs. Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed, and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.Northrop stock is making its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 249.53 entry. Shares are at 243.59.Shares of United Technologies, which makes the F-35's engines as well as the engines for other military planes and helicopters, has been testing support at its 50-day line.The stock, which is also a Dow Jones industrial average component, cleared a 112.93 buy point early this month but dipped back below it. Shares are at 112.14.General Dynamics, which makes tanks and Navy ships, broke out of a flat base in January with a 180.19 buy point. The stock is slightly extended above buying territory, but could drift back into range, which has an upper end of 189.20. Shares are at 190.84.In addition to passenger jets, the aerospace giant makes the Super Hornet fighter and the troubled KC-46 aerial refueling tanker, among other military aircraft.The stock cleared a flat base in January and has been trending toward profit-taking sell territory, which starts at 192.20. It closed at 178.70 on Friday.Trump has also criticized the costs of Boeing's Air Force One replacement program, but CEO Dennis Muilenburg has developed a friendly relationship with the president.

294,LMT,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index slipped to 55.3 in March, losing just a little altitude after hitting a 12-year high of 56.4 the prior month in a vote of confidence for Trumponomics.The polling, from Feb. 24 through March 4, came as financial markets continued their impressive postelection rally, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending Friday north of 21,000. The period also included President Trump's optimistic Feb. 28 address to Congress.""Since my election, Ford (F), Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Sprint (S), Softbank, Lockheed (LMT), Intel (INTC), Wal-Mart (WMT), and many others have announced they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs,"" Trump said in the speech. Just how much credit Trump deserves, if any, for those job announcements is far from clear.General Motors, Intel and Wal-Mart are all Dow components.The Economic Optimism Index registered above the neutral 50 level for the sixth straight month, after signaling pessimism for 17 months from May 2015 through September 2016.""A majority of Americans think that the economy is improving.  They are also optimistic President Donald Trump will deliver on his promises such as tax cuts and less regulations, which are likely to boost U.S. employment and grow the economy,"" said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica, IBD's polling partner. ""The stock market has also posted spectacular gains since he won the election.""IBD'S TAKE: While Americans are still pretty upbeat about President Trump's economic agenda, prospects for a near-term economic stimulus are diminishing.The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months, and views of how well government economic policies are working.While Trump's economic policies are getting broad support so far, there's something of a disconnect between the postelection increase in economic optimism and negative feelings about Trump's overall job performance. The IBD/TIPP Poll found that just 42% approve of the job he's doing as president, while 48% disapprove. The poll was largely completed before Trump's address to Congress last Tuesday. Of the 653 surveyed before the speech, just 39.5% approved of the job he is doing. Of the 256 polled after the speech, his approval rating climbed to 46.1% — a 6.6-point bump.But presidential poll bumps after a big speech often fade quickly. And soon after his address, Trump stepped on that coverage with other headlines.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Poll: Public Turned Off By Media's Relentlessly Negative Coverage Of TrumpTrump's Progress On The Economy Lags Reagan, Bush II, ObamaThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

295,LMT,"Honeywell (HON) lowered its latest five-year demand outlook for civilian helicopters Monday, citing ""slowing economic growth"" and ""volatility"" in the oil and gas markets.The industrial giant, which supplies the helicopter sector, now sees delivery of 3,900-4,400 civilian helicopters in the 2017-2021 time frame, down by 400 from its 2016-2020 outlook, which was also 400 units lower than its prior five-year guidance.Purchase plans for new helicopters in North America dipped 2% from the prior forecast, falling for the second year in a row, according to Honeywell's annual survey of 1,000 chief pilots and flight department managers.Purchase plans in Latin America fell 13% on weakness from Brazil and Venezuela. In the Middle East, purchase plans were down 8%.""The current global economic situation is causing fleet managers to evaluate new helicopter purchases closely, and that's why we're seeing a more cautious five-year demand projection compared with previous years,"" said Ben Driggs, Honeywell Aerospace's Americas president, in a release.Honeywell shares fell 0.1% to 126.08 on the stock market today. Textron (TXT), which owns helicopter maker Bell, closed unchanged. Lockheed Martin (LMT), which bought helicopter maker Sikorsky in 2015 from United Technologies (UTX), fell 4 cents to 267.72. European aerospace giant Airbus (EADSY) eased 0.4%.The decline in planned helicopter purchases come as offshore drilling remains under pressure despite rising oil prices. Helicopters are used to ferry workers to offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea.OPEC and top nonproducers like Russia agreed to cut production, but oil majors have shelved expensive offshore projects in favor for shorter-cycle shale projects onshore.RELATED: Dow Stock Exxon Mobil Sees $25 Billion In Capex, Backs Dividend Hikes

296,LMT,"Missile defense providers Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) rallied to new record highs Wednesday after President Trump vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea amid reports that its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs are advancing more quickly than expected.XTim Cahill, the vice president of Lockheed's Air and Missile Defense business, told Reuters on Tuesday that interest in its missile defense systems has increased in the last 12 to 18 months.Last month, a Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in Alaska intercepted a test missile launched from an Air Force cargo plane near Hawaii. The THAAD system is also deployed in South Korea — to the objection of China, which complains that the system's radar could be used for offensive purposes.Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are having Raytheon upgrade their Patriot systems. NATO member Poland signed a memorandum of understanding to buy Patriot systems after Trump visited that country in July, and the State Department approved the sale of seven Patriot Configuration 3+ defense systems for another NATO partner, Romania.Shares of Lockheed climbed 1.6% to 304.82 on the stock market today, Raytheon jumped 2.3% to 178.75. Both are above buy range. Among other defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) rose 1%, also hitting a new high and above buy range, while General Dynamics (GD) gained 1.4% to retake its 50-day average.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed and Raytheon's stock are extended out of buy range, but you can find other top stocks near their buy range among IBD's review screens that sort out stocks poised for a breakout and give detailed chart analysis.On Wednesday, Trump also implied that he's made America's nuclear arsenal more powerful, though defense observers have pointed out that new weapons won't be fielded until the next decade.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017In January, Trump signed an executive order for the Pentagon to start a Nuclear Posture Review, but a purchasing plan to modernize the system was started by the Obama administration and isn't expected to be completed until the 2020s.The Pentagon also hasn't awarded contracts yet for new ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable cruise missiles, though they could come this fiscal year. Boeing (BA), Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are among the companies vying for the contracts. Deployment of the new ballistic missiles is expected in the late 2020s, and the Air Force plans to start fielding the cruise missiles by 2030.Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, and the Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles. But the B-21 won't enter service until 2025, and the Columbia-class subs aren't expected until the 2030s.RELATED:What Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

299,LMT,"Boeing (BA) said it sees a small but important market for a possible midrange plane, after reporting second-quarter earnings above Wall Street estimates Wednesday.XIn a conference call with analysts, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said that Boeing has talked to over 50 customers about a new midmarket plane and sees demand of 2,000-4,000 aircraft, though the company is still figuring out passenger size and range specs.By contrast, Boeing's latest market outlook put demand for new narrow-body planes over the next 20 years at 29,530.The new plane, which the company hasn't committed to building yet, is seen as an effort to take back market share from European rival Airbus (EADSY) and its popular A321neo narrow-body.A new midrange plane could also been a boon for Boeing's new services business, which provides maintenance and technical support for customers across its businesses and was launched on July 1.Shares soared 10% to close at 233.45 in on the stock market today, hitting yet another record high and entering profit-taking sell territory as they are now more than 20% extended above a 185.81 buy point. Airbus, which reports results Thursday, rose 2.8% to 21.71, clearing 21.55 entry from a flat base.In Q2, Boeing swung to a profit of $2.55 per share from a 44-cent per-share loss in the year ago quarter, when Boeing took $3 billion in pretax charges related to its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker aircraft programs. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.32.

301,LMT,"PALMDALE, Calif. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Skunk Works division, whose legendary history includes the SR-71 spy plane, F-117 stealth fighter and today's F-35, is working on new technology to ensure that U.S. aircraft stay ahead of adversaries.XWhile production on the F-35, a fifth-generation fighter, is just starting to ramp up, the Pentagon is already looking at a sixth-generation fighter.In an interview with IBD, Rob Weiss, Lockheed's executive vice president for Advanced Development Programs and Skunk Works chief, said a new fighter ""hinges around improving lethality, survivability and mission effectiveness.""Stealth will continue to play a major role, especially as more advanced air-defense systems like Russia's S-400 system renders legacy aircraft without stealth technology, such as Boeing's (BA)  F-15 and F/A-18 and Lockheed's F-16, too vulnerable in the contested airspace.Weiss said radars are expanding across the electromagnetic spectrum and moving further into infrared bands, where heat from engines can be detected.The Skunk Works has technology for improvements across the different aspects of stealth, including a plane's radar cross section and its acoustics. A Lockheed illustration of a notional future fighter depicts a sleek, low-profile design.But Weiss hinted at a particular piece of stealth technology that could be a game-changer.""There is one technology we think will make a huge difference in the new fighter,"" he said, declining to give details.Stealth alone won't ensure survivability, and Weiss said the Skunk Works division has a broader approach to it that includes electronic warfare and improved situational awareness.Offensive laser weapons are still too big to put in a new fighter, according to Weiss, but defensive lasers can be made smaller and should be mature enough to go into the future fighter.The Skunk Works is ready to demonstrate a directed-energy system on a Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, as requested by U.S. Special Forces, he noted.Meanwhile, speed is increasingly important to the U.S. military, and a focus at the Skunk Works, as adversaries like China and Russia develop hypersonic weapons, which fly five times faster than the speed of sound. Weiss said the new fighter could carry hypersonic weapons, though the aircraft itself wouldn't be hypersonic.Tech giants like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are rolling out new products with aspects of artificial intelligence, and military technology is headed that way as well.Weiss said the Skunk Works is already putting in ""a lot of work ... continuing insertion of autonomy in all vehicles.""""The technology is moving very quickly, and we are moving quickly,"" he said.When asked if there would be AI in the new fighter, Weiss said ""sure"" but cautioned that the ""level of autonomy in the new fighter is yet to be seen.""RELATED:Rising F-35 Sales Help Lockheed Martin Blast Past Q2 ForecastsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

Revenue is expected to fall 7.2% to $22.96 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries in Q2 fell 8% to 183.""It will be interesting to see commercial jet profit just as you're starting to see the 737 Max phase in,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group. ""They know how to build a next-generation 737, but how will they transition into a profitable 737 Max with 777 numbers coming down? More and more profitability is now depending on the 737 line.""On the defense side, more charges are a possibility.Last month, the Air Force said it doesn't expect Boeing to deliver the first of its new tankers until next year, over delays getting FAA airworthiness certifications and completing flight tests, despite assurances from Boeing that deliveries would start by the end of this year.Boeing has said the issues related to the KC-46 tanker are over. But Aboulafia won't rule out another surprise. ""It seems to be behind them, but who can say with that program.""Aboulafia will also be looking for more detail about the Qatar's $12 billion F-15 order as tensions heat up in the Persian Gulf, with President Trump accusing Doha of funding terrorist groups.The F-15 sales are crucial as Boeing seeks to extend production on the aircraft beyond 2019, after completing an order for Saudi Arabia.Analysts will also be eager for an update on Boeing's midmarket plane which analysts have dubbed the 797, in an effort to take back market share from Airbus and its popular A321neo.During the Paris Air Show, Mike Delaney, general manager of airplane developments at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the new plane's fuselage would have a ""hybrid"" cross-section, according to Reuters, but was light on details.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) will also report results Wednesday, and Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for Thursday.Last week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance as increased F-35 sales helped lift Q2 earnings and revenue well above analyst estimates.RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

303,LMT,"Acting Air Force Secretary Lisa Disbrow said Friday that the service will conduct experiments this summer with aircraft that cost a fraction of the Pentagon's latest jets as it looks for ways to reduce the cost of fighting the Islamic State and other terror groups that lack sophisticated air defenses.At the Air Force Association's Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Disbrow told reporters that a flight demonstration would take place at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.""We want to see if there's a business case there,"" Disbrow said in her State of the Air Force address earlier. A light attack option ""has the potential to greatly reduce operating costs"" and still meet combatant commanders' requirements.Breaking: @usairforce plans to hold light attack aircraft flight demo this summer at @HollomanAFB . #AWS17— Valerie Insinna (@ValerieInsinna) March 3, 2017The Pentagon has debated the idea for a light attack aircraft for some time and even deployed Vietnam-era propeller-driven planes to Iraq in 2015 to see how they performed against Islamic State targets.Disbrow said the Air Force needs to ""explore off-the-shelf technologies"" to curb costs as the service faces budget and workforce constraints.Possible options include Embraer's (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano, Textron's (TXT) Scorpion or Textron's Beechcraft AT-6, according to reports.The price tag for buying the Super Tucano would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current cost of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.Disbrow also confirmed that the service asked for more F-35s as part of an unfunded priority list sent to Congress.More expensive fighters like the F-35 and Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet and would be needed in so-called contested environments and against sophisticated rival planes from China and Russia.Lockheed shares edged up 0.2% to 267.56 on the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.1% to 242.93. Textron lost 1.6% but Embraer shares rallied 3.4%.Meanwhile, at the Australian International Airshow, Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 program chief, told Aviation Week that the unit price of an F-35A, including engine, could fall to $80 million if customers ordered the jet in multiyear lots.On Tuesday, Lt.

305,LMT,"The Trump administration on Monday tossed out the first pitch of the president's first budget campaign, proposing $54 billion in new defense spending and a corresponding trim to the federal discretionary budget, which funds agencies including the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The push begins with what Bloomberg reported as a $30 billion budget amendment from the Pentagon.…

306,LMT,"President Trump's budget request calls for a $54 billion increase in defense spending and will give the Defense Department latitude on where the extra money goes, according to a Reuters report, after earlier worries that the White House budget chief would be stingy with the Pentagon.OMB Director Mick Mulvaney was a fiscal hawk and sequester backer when he was in the House of Representatives, and the White House's budget proposal seeks offsetting budget cuts equal to the Defense Department boost in other areas of discretionary spending.But the proposal has more money allotted for ships and military aircraft to have ""a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints,"" an official told Reuters.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares rose 1.3% to 269.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 270 buy point from a cup base. Northrop Grumman (NOC) advanced 1.45% to 248.60, on its way to a 253.90 entry. Raytheon (RTN) picked up 0.9% to 154.82, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing (BA) climbed 1.1%.General Dynamics (GD) advanced 0.4% and Huntington Ingalls (HII) 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Even if Trump ramps up defense spending analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.The increases in defense spending will be funded by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-military agencies, according to the Reuters report, but won't include cuts from Social Security or Medicare, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday.Additional specifics weren't available, though Trump could reveal some Tuesday night during his address to a joint session of Congress.During his campaign, he promised to increase the Navy's fleet by 78 ships to at least 350, and add at least 100 combat fighters to the Air Force. He also vowed to boost the Army's ranks by 60,000 and the Marine Corps' by 12,000.But it remains to be seen how the White House plans to balance increases in weapons procurement, which would send more money to the big defense contractors, with increases in personnel spending, which requires putting money in housing, chow halls, uniforms and medical care.The additional dollar on warplanes would come after Trump blasted high military aircraft costs and vowed to get a better deal on Lockheed's F-35 and suggested buying updated Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.RELATED:Trump: ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet OrderInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'

307,LMT,"Three popular ""Trump trades"" — exchange traded funds tracking defense and aerospace stock indexes — continue to present a buying opportunity as investors await more details about the president's proposed $54 billion hike in military spending.IShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense (PPA) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) were modestly higher on the stock market today.The iShares ETF, the largest in this group, remains within a 5% buy zone after climbing above its 146.86 buy point the week of Feb. 10.Its SPDR and PowerShares peers are similarly positioned as Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX) and General Dynamics (GD) look to trace key moves on their charts.All three ETFs saw a sharp spike in trading activity following the Nov. 8 presidential election, then consolidated gains before staging fresh breakouts from flat bases in February.  They have faltered with the broad market in recent sessions, but Trump's budget outline, expected on Thursday, could see them make another run up.The ETFs have advanced roughly 15% since Trump's win amid swelling optimism over his proposals to boost the nation's military might.They made 52-week highs March 2 but now sit below their 10-day lines on potential profit-taking.The iShares ETF has seen positive net inflow every month since July, with more than $470 million pouring in over January and February.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) struggled for gains in afternoon trade Monday as investors girded for a key Fed rate decision later this week as well as a new phase in the U.K.'s Brexit battle.This bellwether ETF saw its first weekly decline in seven weeks Friday as oil prices and the energy sector sold off hard.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump and Fed agendas emerge, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to assess whether the stock market has more room to run.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

308,LMT,"Boeing's (BA) chief financial officer emphasized that the KC-46 tanker's issues are behind it and all that is left is making sure the factory work is done as efficiently as possible, after the company took another charge on the program in the fourth quarter.The aerospace giant has said several times before that the KC-46 is past its growing pains. But last month, Boeing said it booked a $312 million Q4 charge ""to incorporate previously identified changes into initial production aircraft."" Under its contract with the Air Force, Boeing is on the hook for cost overruns, and total charges on the KC-46 are nearing $2 billion. It's also behind schedule and won't be delivered to the Air Force until late 2017.""The risk profile on the tanker is very different from what it was,"" Boeing CFO Greg Smith said at the Barclays Industrial Select conference in Miami on Thursday. ""It's now in the factory. It's just work, just factory work.""But that doesn't mean there are no more risks. There is still flight testing to be done, and new issues could come up.""We've got flight tests left to do and stuff,"" Smith said. ""But a lot of that — again from a perspective, I'd say development — is behind us. The airplane is flying great.""He added that there are ""lots of opportunities"" for defense sales in general to international markets.Also Thursday, during a meeting with CEOs of top U.S. manufacturers, President Trump said he gave some allies authorization to buy U.S. planes, but he didn't give any details on who got approval and which aircraft were approved.At the meeting was Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson. The F-35 has numerous international buyers, but Trump has been a harsh critic of its costs, which have been coming down, and suggested it may be pitted in a U.S. competition against Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet. Trump said last week he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Super Hornets.Meanwhile, the fortunes of Boeing fighters have been looking up following earlier concerns that production lines may have to close soon due to lack of demand. Last year, the Obama administration approved sales of up to 72 Boeing F-15s for Qatar and 32 Super Hornets for Kuwait, as part of a package that included the sales of 19 Lockheed F-16s to Bahrain.Boeing shares rose 0.9% to 176.86 on the stock market today. Lockheed dipped 0.4% to 264.85.Despite Boeing's problems with the KC-46, they have paled in comparison to those endured by European rival Airbus (EADSY), which has racked up more than $7 billion in charges associated with its A400M military transport plane.Like the KC-46, the A400M contract requires Airbus to shoulder much of the risks. On Wednesday, the company said it booked a Q4 charge of 1.2 billion euros for the plane, and management now wants to rework the contract to ""to cap the remaining exposure"" on the program.""De-risking the program and strengthening program execution are our top priorities for this aircraft in 2017,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement.Airbus' U.S. listed shares jumped 3.4% to 18.19.RELATED: GE Warns Policy Uncertainty Will Hit Businesses; Trump Tax Plan To Come

310,LMT,"President Trump's call with the Pentagon's F-35 chief and Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg last month could give Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors grounds for protest in future competitions, an analyst said.After a House Armed Services subcommittee Thursday, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said it wasn't inappropriate that Muilenburg was on a call that then-President-elect Trump made to him on Jan. 17 about Lockheed's F-35.Bogdan said that the discussion centered around Boeing's Air Force One replacement, even though he doesn't work on that program, as well as a comparison of the Navy's F-35C variant vs. a new version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet that Boeing is proposing.""The things I talked about in front of Mr. Muilenburg were clearly publicly releasable information,"" Bogdan said. ""I understand the rules about talking about Lockheed Martin stuff in front of Mr. Muilenburg.""A Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had no comment about the phone call.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that even though Bogdan was careful with his words, Boeing could have learned some information that other potential competitors wouldn't have access to, giving it an advantage in future competitions.He added that while Lockheed currently doesn't have any grounds for legal action, if a future competition pitted its F-35C against an advanced Boeing F/A- Super Hornet, then Lockheed would have every right to ask to know what Boeing's CEO heard during that call and could give Lockheed grounds for a bid protest.Boeing shares rose 1.1% to close at 172.71 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares ended flat at 265.35. F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was also essentially unchanged at 243.58.Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University and former associate administrator for procurement law and legislation at the Office of Management and Budget, said that on the face of things the conversation ""doesn't appear to violate the Procurement Integrity Act"" because there isn't enough information showing that the call involved an actual active procurement.However, if any propriety Lockheed information, such as technology or pricing, was shared, then that would have been ""wildly inappropriate and potentially illegal,"" he added.Still, he couldn't imagine a situation where Lockheed would take legal action: ""Not much reason for Lockheed to poke the bear.""But legal issues aside, Schooner said Trump's phone call could have broken trust between the Pentagon and its industry partners.""Gen. Bogdan is (Lockheed's) partner in a massive enterprise of tremendous importance to the nation, the company and its shareholders,"" he told IBD in an interview. ""That's not the kind of behavior that instills trust and confidence in a business relationship.""Bloomberg first reported that Muilenburg was listening in on the call with Trump, who has attacked Lockheed's fighter program over its costs and suggested it would compete against Boeing's Super Hornet.Bogdan said Thursday that no decisions were made on the call, but the questions asked were the foundation of reviews that Defense Secretary James Mattis has since ordered on the F-35 and Boeing's Air Force One replacement.The F-35 review will look at ""opportunities to significantly reduce the cost"" as well as compare the F-35C to an upgraded Super Hornet.Last month, the Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said the F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than the Super Hornet but noted that the F-35 would be ""supplemented by a healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets"" going forward.RELATED: Northrop: F-35 Talks With Lockheed Are On Course Since Trump TurbulenceLockheed: Acquisition Officials, Policy Shift More Critical Than Trump On Sales

311,LMT,"President Trump didn't mention the Export-Import Bank when he spoke Friday at Boeing's (BA) facility in South Carolina, but he did say he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets.Trump was widely expected to voice his support for the federal export credit agency or nominate someone to Ex-Im's five-member board, which would restore full lending power at the federal export credit agency.Despite Trump's increasingly close relationship with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Trump's silence on the matter could mean he is siding with congressional Republicans who earlier fought President Obama's push to expand the bank's lending limit, calling it crony capitalism that favors big companies.The federal export credit agency, derided by critics as the ""Bank of Boeing,"" was closed for six months after its charter expired in June 2015, before opening back up with limited authority.Boeing shares climbed 1.1% to close at 172.71 on the stock market today. Shares of General Electric (GE) and Caterpillar (CAT), which have been Ex-Im Bank backers, fell 0.3% and rose 0.6%, respectively.Boeing also unveiled its new 787-10 Dreamliner at the event, but Trump's speech focused more on Boeing's defense unit as Trump asked the crowd about Super Hornets and said he was looking at a ""big order.""He also said the price of the Air Force One program was too high but that he and Muilenburg ""were getting there.""Trump has blasted Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35s over high costs on Twitter (TWTR) and said he was considering an advanced F/A-18 Super Hornet as a possible rival to the F-35C version for the Navy.Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews on the costs of the F-35 and Boeing's Air Force One replacement.RELATED: Why Lockheed Could Protest In The Future After Trump's F-35, Boeing Call

312,LMT,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) said that F-35 contract negotiations to ""drive down"" the price with prime contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT) haven't changed significantly since President Trump blasted the fighter for ""out of control"" costs.Northrop is a major subcontractor on the F-35, making the center fuselage, fire control radar, and the communications and navigation system, while also helping develop the mission system and mission planning software.When asked at Cowen's Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference Thursday if talks with Lockheed on the 11th batch of fighters have changed since Trump began criticizing the F-35's costs, Northrop CFO Ken Bedingfield said he hasn't seen a ""significant difference in terms of negotiations.""""Our focus really is about continuing to drive down costs of the aircraft and, in particular, our components,"" he added. ""We are doing well as a company across our contracts.""Northrop shares rose 1% to 234.79 on the stock market today. Lockheed was up 0.5% to 258.09.After Trump attacked the F-35's costs, he took credit for a $600 million reduction on the 10th batch of fighters after meeting with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, and industry watchers speculated that Lockheed could put pressure on suppliers like Northrop to lower costs.But before that, the Pentagon predicted a 6%-7% drop in Lot 10 costs and had been working on cuts before the president became involved, according to a Washington Post report.Last week, the Defense Department reached an $8.2 billion deal for 90 F-35s for production Lot 10, a $728 million in total cost reduction vs. Lot 9, according to the Pentagon.IBD's aerospace and defense industry group ranks No. 87 out of 197 groups. Lockheed is forming a base with a 270 buy point. Northrop is shaping a base also. But in both patterns, most of the price action has been below the 50-day moving average, a weakness.RELATED: What The Air Force Chief Said In His 5 Minutes With Trump

313,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) chief financial officer said officials who fill key acquisition positions in the Defense Department and any policy changes would be more important than President Trump's direct actions on sales in the defense sector.During a presentation at Cowen's Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference Wednesday, Bruce Tanner was speaking about sales of missile defense systems to Asia and the Middle East as well as F-35 sales in Asia when he was asked about Trump's effect on demand given his ""aggressive stance on some issues.""""The better question would be who is going to fill the acquisition slots in the Pentagon representing the administration and whether or not there's signals sent over a shift in policy,"" he replied. ""I'm not suggesting there is. I don't know. I think that would be more critical maybe than the ongoing influence of the president directly.""During his campaign Trump threatened to withdraw troops from Japan and South Korea unless the countries contributed more on defense. Meanwhile, the U.S. agreed to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea, and Japan is considering the system as well.In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has been a major buyer of Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system, though Lockheed makes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile for the system.Earlier in conference, top Raytheon executives said they have seen ""strong demand signals"" overseas for the Patriot system.The company is currently working on a deal with Poland and another European customer is expected to finalize a deal in late 2017 or early 2018, they added.Raytheon also said it's waiting to see what Trump will do with his corporate tax plan regarding exports, as foreign sales account for 31% of the company's total sales.As part of a larger revamp meant to ease the overall tax burden on companies, Trump and House Republicans have backed a plan that would end taxes on exports and impose a 20% tax on imports.Lockheed shares closed 0.1% higher at 256.74 in the stock market today. Raytheon edged up less than 0.1% to 148.19.Trump has also been critical of the F-35's costs, though the Pentagon and Lockheed had already been working to reduce prices.Last week, the Defense Department reached an $8.2 billion deal for 90 F-35s, representing the 10th batch of fighters. Tanner said Wednesday: ""hopefully every party is satisfied, or else they shouldn't have agreed to it.""Talks are ongoing for the 11th production batch, and Tanner said he hopes they will wrap up by late Q3 or early Q4.But the 9th lot, the contract for which was awarded last year, remains an issue. Earlier, Lockheed said the deal was a ""unilateral contract action"" on the Pentagon's part as both sides struggled to reach an agreement.On Wednesday, Tanner said the company has grounds for legal or other action and is still looking at its options.RELATED: What The Air Force Chief Said In His 5 Minutes With TrumpLockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost Flap

315,LMT,"President Trump urged Americans to abandon conflict and help him remake the fabric of the country in his first address to Congress, a moment he hopes will turn the page on his administration's chaotic beginning and bring clarity to his policy agenda.""What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit,"" Trump said. ""Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.""His speech outlined an agenda that begins with strong national defense, including a ruthless pursuit of Islamic State and aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. He exhorted lawmakers to act swiftly on repealing Obamacare, passing a tax overhaul and a $1 trillion infrastructure investment program, and slashing the regulatory state.Trump arrived at the lectern in the House of Representatives with a heavy burden: to explain his plans to skeptics, including a growing number of fellow Republicans. His address comes six weeks into a term marked by record highs in the U.S. stock market but also mass protests against his presidency, court battles over a proposed travel ban, and a controversial habit of policy making via Twitter.Trump faced a choice in his speech to either echo his inaugural address and stoke his nationalist and conservative base, or to reach toward the political center and explore compromise with his opponents.""I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength,"" Trump said, according to prepared remarks released by the White House. ""From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears.""U.S. stock futures held gains as Trump spoke, with futures on the S&P 500 Index rising 0.3% after the underlying index fell 0.3% from a record on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: For a deeper look at how investors will react to Trump's speech, check out this special late-night Stock Market Today column.U.S. stocks have led a global rally in riskier assets since Trump's election, though gains have also come amid strengthening fundamentals from corporate profits to economic data. Almost $3 trillion has been added to the value of U.S. stocks since Nov. 8, as the S&P 500 Index has surged 11% to a record and the Dow Jones Industrial Average just capped a 12th day of closing at an all-time high, matching its longest-ever streak set in 1987.Foreign currency markets have lost some of their enthusiasm for the Trump trade, with the U.S. dollar lower by more than 3% since Jan. 3 after surging 6.5% following the election, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index.Trump said that since his election Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Sprint (S), Softbank (SFTBY), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Intel (INTC), Wal-Mart (WMT) ""and many others"" had announced billions of dollars in investments and ""tens of thousands of new American jobs.""""The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record,"" he said.Hours before his speech, Trump signaled to network television anchors in a private meeting at the White House that he's open to legislation that would overhaul the nation's immigration laws. That set off speculation the president might be poised to make an about-face and support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. A senior administration official said the president has not changed his core positions on the issue.""By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks.""By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks.He adopted a somewhat more nuanced approach to distinguishing peaceful Muslims from terrorists. Islamic State, he said, had ""slaughtered Muslims and Christians,"" and the U.S. would work with allies, ""including our friends and allies in the Muslim world,"" to extinguish the threat.Trump drew a standing ovation from Republicans in the chamber when he again described a U.S. fight against ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" using language former President Obama resisted as inflammatory.Trump said that even as he was speaking his immigration crackdown was ""removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak.""The president made a stab at encouraging optimism and unity, ideals at odds with much of his governance. Many of his first acts have proved divisive, especially executive orders to enhance immigration enforcement and ban U.S. entry to travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, as well as a decision to revoke an Obama-era directive intended to protect transgender children from bullying at schools.""The time for small thinking is over,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks. ""The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.""In a signal of where Trump stands on immigration, among the guests invited to sit with First Lady Melania Trump were Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, widows of California law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty by an undocumented immigrant, and Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose son was shot by a gang member in the country illegally, according to the White House. Maureen McCarthy Scalia, the widow of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, also was invited ahead of Senate hearings next month on Trump's nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy, federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch.Democratic women in the House chamber wore white in a show of protest and solidarity. Several Democrats invited undocumented immigrants as their guests. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who called Trump a ""faker"" during his campaign, planned to skip the address.The Trump Cabinet member who didn't attend the speech in the event of catastrophe — the so-called designated survivor — was Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.Congressional Republicans were looking for any endorsement by Trump of a border-adjusted tax, a roughly $1 trillion revenue-raiser that sits at the heart of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash corporate and individual tax rates. The plan is struggling for support, and proponents are eager for a boost from Trump, who has so far sent mixed signals on the proposal.""My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks, which didn't specifically mention the border-adjusted tax. ""At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.""Under the House GOP border-adjustment plan, the current corporate income tax would be replaced with a 20% levy on imports and domestic sales, while exempting exports. The measure has stirred sharp divisions among businesses: Retailers, automakers and oil refiners that rely on imported goods and materials oppose it, while export-heavy manufacturers support it. Critics argue that the plan would raise prices for consumers, while proponents say that, in theory, international currency-exchange rates will adjust to prevent raising consumer prices or favoring exporters.Trump implored Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a centerpiece of his campaign.""Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.""But the effort has stalled, with Republicans divided on a policy to replace the law known as Obamacare and facing protests from voters in their home districts. Trump described the law as ""collapsing"" and said that ""action is not a choice.""""Democrats and Republicans,"" Trump said, should ""work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.""Trump has previously proposed spending as much as $1 trillion on U.S. roads, bridges, sea ports, airports and other public works, and his advisers have suggested that the program would rely on private-sector funding. The president renewed the commitment but provided no new details in Tuesday's address.""To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States —  financed through both public and private capital —  creating millions of new jobs,"" he said in the prepared remarks.RELATED:

316,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) and the Pentagon confirmed a deal Friday for the 10th production batch of F-35 fighters, for $8.2 billion.The contract covers 90 aircraft: 76 of the F-35A variant with a unit cost is $94.6 million, a 7.3% reduction from the ninth batch; 12 of the F-35B short-takeoff-vertical-landing variant with a unit cost of $122.8 million, a 6.7% reduction; and two of the F-35C carrier-launched variant with a unit cost of $121.8 million, a 7.9% reduction.The Pentagon's joint program office said the total cost is $8.2 billion. A Lockheed spokesperson originally said the deal was worth $8.5 billion, then referred questions to the program office. The JPO, in a late Friday clarification to IBD, said that the $8.2 billion figure doesn't include jet engines covered under a separate deal with Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies (UTX) unit.Lockheed Martin shares rose 1% to 254.46 in Friday stock market trading.  Lockheed is finding resistance at the 50-day line.Originally lots 9 and 10 were to be negotiated together, but the Defense Department finalized the deal for lot 9 in November for 57 jets at a cost of $6.1 billion, in what Lockheed called a ""unilateral contract action"" that wasn't mutually agreed upon.The Pentagon said Lot 10 represents a $728 million total reduction vs. Lot 9, if compared against a 90-jet order with unit price tags seen in Lot 9.Last week, Trump claimed that he helped cut $600 million off lot 10 after his meeting with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson.""There was no movement and I was able to get $600 million approximately off those planes. So I think that was a great achievement.""However, it's not clear that Trump did really achieve anything, as the Pentagon had already mentioned the cost savings before Trump became involved, the Washington Post previously reported.On Dec. 19, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said that the Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6% to 7%, which comes to cost savings of between $550 million to $630 million.A Lockheed statement Friday said Trump's involvement ""accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus"" on reducing the price.Trump has been critical of the costs for the $400 billion F-35 program and suggested that it could face competition from the Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.Last week Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program's costs.Boeing shares edged up 0.1%.RELATED: Lockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost Flap

In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday.

325,LMT,"Boeing (BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said Tuesday he ""made some great progress"" in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect's demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One.In addition to Boeing's contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet.""We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,"" Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. ""We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.""Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of ""the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,"" although no specific reductions have yet been announced.""I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business,"" Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. ""We're on the same page here.""Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, Muilenburg touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports.""You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest,"" Muilenburg said. ""We're proud to take on that mission.""Trump's public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that ""Boeing is building a brand-new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!""In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion.""We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens,"" Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his ""personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.""More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft.Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for ""out of control costs"" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for more than 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11.Trump also called on Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,"" referring to the company's F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters.After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs ""significantly'' on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s.The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems Plc, a key subcontractor on the program.""Over a period there's no question we've been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,"" Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. ""We respect that and we'll work towards a contribution towards that.""At the time of Trump's tweet about Air Force One, it wasn't immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon's top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract.On Air Force One and the F-35, ""he's heard these big numbers,"" Frank Kendall said in an interview. ""Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They're not contract values, necessarily.""""The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we're buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means,"" Kendall said. ""We're still negotiating with Boeing on that.""Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts.""His general interest in reducing costs is terrific — his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics,"" Kendall said.

329,LMT,"Botched testing by a Lockheed Martin (LMT) subcontractor on a key component for the U.S.' newest Global Positioning System satellites raises new questions about the No. 1 defense contractor's supervision of the project, according to a top Air Force official.The mistake by subcontractor Harris Corp. (HRS) forced another delay in the delivery of the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites until later this month, according to Major General Roger Teague, the Air Force's chief of space programs. That will make the $528 million satellite 34 months late, according to service data.Lockheed has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites designed to provide a more accurate version of the Global Positioning System used for everything from the military's targeting of terrorists to turn-by-turn directions for civilians' smartphones.The program's latest setback may affect a pending Air Force decision on whether to open the final 22 satellites to competition from Lockheed rivals Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).""This was an avoidable situation and raised significant concerns with Lockheed Martin subcontractor management/oversight and Harris program management,"" Teague said in a Dec. 21 message to congressional staff obtained by Bloomberg News. Shares of Lockheed were up fractionally to 257.28 in late-afternoon trading.The parts in question are ceramic capacitors that have bedeviled the satellite project. They take higher-voltage power from the satellite's power system and reduce it to a voltage required for a particular subsystem.Last year, the Air Force and contractors discovered that Harris hadn't conducted tests on the components, including how long they would operate without failing, that should have been completed in 2010.Now, the Air Force says it found that Harris spent June to October of last year doing follow-up testing on the wrong parts instead of samples of the suspect capacitors installed on the first three satellites. Harris ""immediately notified Lockheed and the government"" after a post-test inspection, Teague said in his message.Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said in an email said that testing of the capacitors' design was successfully completed in December.""The capacitors met all mission qualification requirements,"" he said, so ""we are confident the capacitors are mission-ready.""Harris spokeswoman Ellen Mitchell said in an email that company personnel last year identified a capacitor ""that was not subjected to all required qualification tests. Once the issue was discovered, Harris deployed a team dedicated to complete the required capacitor tests. The capacitor qualification testing was successfully completed in December 2016.""Teague said in an interview, though, that Harris was required to perform not only a test to show that the part met design specifications but a separate one to assess the component's reliability and whether it met a requirement to last 15 years. That second test wasn't accomplished because ""they used the wrong test item,"" he said.Cristina Chaplain, a military space systems director at the Government Accountability Office, said in an email that the latest problem ""undermines the faith in the progress, if any, that the government and contractor may have been making in turning around a culture that has led to multiyear delays"" and cost increases.The Air Force has decided to accept the first satellite even if its capacitors may be flawed because removing them could delay the delivery until October and cost about $70 million, Teague wrote to the congressional staff. The Air Force is confident in the first satellite's overall reliability based on 3,000 hours of cumulative testing, Teague said.The Air Force will have to pay to replace the suspect capacitors on the second and third satellites. That's because the satellites are being developed under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, which require the Pentagon to pay for cost increases, the service said.In an Air Force list of priorities that lacked funding for this year, the service said it needed $100 million for GPS III ""capacitor repair/replace."" Captain AnnMarie Annicelli, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the list represented potential expenditures on which final decisions had not been made.

333,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein said that each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was given five minutes with President Trump last week to talk about their respective military branches and what they do.When his turn came, Goldfein said at a Mitchell Institute breakfast Friday that he stressed the importance of the Air Force's role in the nuclear triad — weapons delivered by land-based missiles, strategic bombers and submarines — space operations and manpower.He didn't specifically mention Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, of which the Air Force is the biggest buyer.""We have two of the three legs of the nuclear triad and on our worst day as a nation our job as the United States Air Force is to make sure you are where you need to be and make sure you remain connected to nuclear command and control,"" he recounted telling Trump, just before James Mattis was sworn in as defense secretary at a Pentagon ceremony last week.Goldfein also pointed out that the Air Force is responsible for GPS and communications satellites as well as other space-based assets. He stressed the need to continue maintaining air and space superiority, including ""the freedom from attack and the freedom to move"" in both domains.Lastly, Goldfein told Trump about personnel shortages, saying the Air Force was ""too big for the resources we've been given and too small for what the nation demands"" as the service's role expands.Trump's talk with the service chiefs comes as his administration plans to boost spending on weapons and troops, with several big-ticket programs on the way, including Air Force nuclear programs.Last year, the service released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman system and is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are expected to bid, and initial contracts could be awarded this year.Northrop is also developing the B-21 Raider long-range strategic bomber to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Analysts have put the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Boeing shares edged up 0.1% to 162.40 on the stock market today. Northrop shares climbed 0.7%, Raytheon 0.9% and Lockheed 1%.To develop new rockets, the Pentagon has been working with Boeing, Elon Musk's Space X and others in the private sector.Space X's Falcon 9 was decertified in September after a rocket exploded on the launchpad, but Goldfein said it is ""right on track"" be recertified for national security launches.The Air Force has been tasked to transition to at least two independent domestic commercial launch providers to help drive competition, lower costs and end its reliance on Russian-made rocket engines. Previously, a Boeing-Lockheed joint venture, United Launch Alliance, held a virtual monopoly on Pentagon launches.RELATED: Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

And Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, thinks Lockheed has the advantage.""You need one of two things to survive a price shootout competition,"" he said. ""You need either no upfront costs or sheer determination and a little bit of desperation.""Lockheed and partner Korea Aerospace Industries are using the existing T-50As and have ""absolutely no upfront costs to speak of to roll into the contract price,"" Aboulafia said.Boeing on the other hand is building a clean-sheet design that is ""heavily optimized"" for the T-X mission, according to Aboulafia. ""They are really eager and aggressive to win it. That matters. You get points for that.""Northrop, an early front-runner for its expertise in building the existing T-38 trainers, already has the B-21 bomber contract and lacks the desperation that Boeing has in the airframe space.Northrop is ""going to be a surviving military airframer into the 2030s. For Boeing, the jury is out.""Boeing lost the B-21 bid in 2015, and production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet will eventually wind down, leaving analysts wondering if Boeing's storied history of building bombers and fighters is coming to an end.Lockheed shares fell 0.2%. Boeing shares rose 0.3%.Last week Raytheon bowed out of the running, saying it and Leonardo were ""unable to reach a business agreement that is in the best interest of the U.S. Air Force.""Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit, said price was probably the reason the Northrop and Raytheon teams dropped out.""No way industry can meet the spec at the unit price USAF wants,"" he wrote in an email. ""You can't get Ferrari performance at a Chevy price.""He said that the Air Force either has to raise the acquisition budget or reduce the number of planes it buys. But getting a larger budget could be a problem under President Trump.""I think the president is going to spend more money on combat aircraft, tanks, ships, sustainment, weapons and missiles than on more for the trainer budget.""Another reason for the possible dropouts is profitability concerns.Profits for subcontractors in the fields of radar and other systems have been much higher than being a prime contractor for a major weapons system, said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.He said this was especially true of Northrop, given its lead role for the B-21 program.RELATED: Lockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost FlapNorthrop, Raytheon Join Lockheed With Weak Views But New Budget Looms

337,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Air Force is requesting more authority to deal with drones affecting operations near bases after a near-miss with an F-22 last week.XAt an Air Force Association breakfast Tuesday, Gen. Mike Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command, said  a pilot in a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-22 had a ""near collision with a small UAS"" while trying to land. He said that a hobbyist was most likely flying the unmanned aerial system, but warned ""you never know.""""Imagine a world where somebody flies a couple hundred of those and flies one down the intake of my F-22s with just a small weapon on it,"" he said.In April, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flight over 133 military bases, and Holmes said there are signs around bases that say it's a ""no-drone area.""But that has done little to stop drones from wandering into military airspace. Holmes said that in a separate incident last week, a drone flew over a gate at another base.Drones made headlines last month after a U.S. Boeing (BA) F-15E fighter shot down an Iranian-built drone in Syria.But Holmes has no real authority to deal with errant drones at home; it's illegal to shoot them out of the sky and only certain federal civilian agencies have the authority to disable drones.""The rules basically are the same if it was a civil aircraft,"" he said. ""If it was a civil aircraft I could track it back to where it came from and find that pilot and admonish them or take their license.""But with a drone there is no way to trace it back to its owner.""We are working to get authority for the nuclear sites first,"" Holmes said of gaining more control over drones near military bases.  ""I'm making that request we need to extend those authorities beyond the nuclear assets to protect our other assets.""The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act ​includes provisions that would let Defense Department and Energy Department facilities take down drones in their airspace. That won't mean shooting them out of the sky, however, but using jamming and other devices to disrupt the drone's communication system.Drones will continue to be an issue for the military as more hobbyists fly affordable and accessible drones and Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) tests drone delivery services.The FAA expects the number of hobbyist drones to soar from 1.1 million at the end of 2016 to more than 3.5 million by 2021. The commercial, nonhobbyist UAS fleet is expected to grow from 42,000 at the end of last year to 442,000 aircraft by 2021, with the possibility of as many as 1.6 million drones.It's a ""growing commercial enterprise,"" Holmes said.

339,LMT,"Turkey reportedly agreed to buy Russia's formidable S-400 air-defense system for $2.5 billion, amid ongoing tensions between the NATO member and its allies.XTurkey will receive its first two S-400 missile batteries within the next year, and another two batteries will be built in Turkey, sources told Bloomberg.The deal with Russia is another sign that Turkey's relationship with NATO is strained over U.S. support for Kurdish rebels in Syria and European Union concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on dissidents following a failed coup.Not only did Turkey turn down a Western air-defense option, but the S-400 represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges. Its radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter — like Lockheed's F-16 or Boeing's (BA) F-15 and F/A-18 — before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system.Turkey was also looking at the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), which is jointly built by Lockheed Martin (Lockheed) as well as German and Italian defense companies.Turkey has been in need of an air-defense system since 2015, when key NATO members removed two Raytheon (RTN) Patriot systems the alliance deployed in 2013 after determining Syria no longer posed a threat to Turkey.Turkey first considered developing a homegrown system, but that would've required a decade to build. Ankara then looked at buying a system from a Chinese company, but that deal fell through under pressure from NATO allies over the company's dealings in Iran.Lockheed shares edged up 0.2% to 286.86 on the stock market today.

341,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Air Force said Tuesday that the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 is the most cost-effective way to modernize its aging fighter platforms a day after Congress was warned of the program's rising costs.According to a Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) submitted to Congress Monday, acquisition costs for the F-35 are expected to increase yet again to $406.5 billion from $379 billion currently. Total program costs are seen rising nearly 2% to $1.53 trillion.But at an Air Force Association breakfast Tuesday, Gen. Mike Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command, said the stealth fighters offered the best bang for the buck.""The most cost effective option to recap our fighter force is the F-35. That will provide us unparalleled capability in that mutli-dimensional contested battle,"" he said.Lockheed shares edged up 0.3% to 286.47 on the stock market today. F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was up 0.4% to 262.76, just moving out of range.Holmes said the service's goal is to acquire 60 F-35 per year but said that the service should be buying 80 to 100 new F-35s a year to drive the average age of an Air Force jet down from 27 years old currently.The SAR out Monday detailed the Air Force's plans to only buy 60 F-35s a year, pushing the acquisition range out by six more years to fiscal year 2044, adding to costs.But the U.S. and allies are banking on the new jet to be the backbone of their fighter fleets for decades to come.""I can't overstate how essential that weapon system will be,"" Holmes said of the F-35.Gen. Amir Eshel, chief of staff of Israel's air force, called the plane ""game changing,"" according to Holmes, saying that Israel found new information when flying the F-35 earlier this year that other reconnaissance and intelligence gathering systems had missed.In November Israel announced that it would buy 17 more F-35s bringing it total order to 50.Germany is also reportedly interested in buying the F-35. The German military was briefed on the F-35 by Pentagon officials this week according to Reuters. But Berlin hasn't yet made a decision on a procurement plan to replace its current Tornado fighter jets.But not everyone is sold on the F-35.

345,LMT,"President Donald Trump is as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report Friday from a noted short seller, which also warned on aerospace supplier TransDigm's (TDG).""President Trump has promised to end the long-standing, infuriating tradition of 'sticking the US Government with tab,' "" Citron Research said in a note. ""He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft a pillar of his transition into office.""During his transition, Trump took to Twitter (TWTR) to call out Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) over high costs for Air Force One and the F-35 program respectively.After meeting with Trump, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said after her meeting with Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create thousands of jobs and that the company is near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the costs.Last month, the Pentagon's program office said that costs would likely come down ""6%-7%"" for the 10th batch of fighters.Boeing shares rose 0.3% to 159.53 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares climbed 0.3% to 257.73.But Boeing and Lockheed likely won't be the last aerospace companies that Trump targets. Citron wrote that TransDigm's business model relies too much on raising prices to turn a profit, potentially putting it in Trump's cross hairs in the future.The company ""acquires airplane parts companies (over 50 in total), fires employees, and egregiously raises prices"" just like drugmaker Valeant (VRX), Citron claimed.TransDigm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares plunged 9.9% to 226.90.TransDigm is a major supplier to Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and other aerospace giants.IBD'S TAKE: The littoral combat ship, nuclear missiles and Northrop's B-21 are other defense programs Trump could take aim at next.Despite the perception that Trump would be friendlier to the drug industry than Clinton would have been, Trump has recently accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" on prices and has vowed to lower them.RELATED: Navy: Lockheed F-35 'On A Completely Different Level' Vs.

John Richardson said Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet, which President-elect Donald Trump has suggested may compete against the more advanced stealth jet.In a ""Defense One"" sponsored event Tuesday, Richardson said the Super Hornet, which is considered a 4th-generation fighter, could be upgraded to a 4.5-generation fighter and noted that the Navy's carrier air wing will consist of 5th- and 4th-generation fighters ""in the foreseeable future.""""We need the F-35s,"" he said. ""That is our 5th-gen capability which we need, supplemented by healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets.""Addressing Trump's complaints about the F-35's costs and his vow to lower them, Richardson added, ""We need that capability, and we need to get it at the very best price for the taxpayer.""Shares of Lockheed were down 0.2% to 254.12 at the close on the stock market today.

351,LMT,"The Trump administration should ""rigorously and comprehensively review"" Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 jet, the Pentagon's costliest program, the Defense Department's director of combat testing said Tuesday.Michael Gilmore, who will leave the post as testing director when Donald Trump takes office as president next week, cited the fighter's ""significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities"" in a letter Monday to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas, who's a strong supporter of the F-35. Thornberry's district neighbors Fort Worth, where the F-35 factory is located.While Trump has tweeted that ""the F-35 program and cost is out of control,"" Pentagon officials say the plane is now essentially on schedule and close to its budget after earlier problems. But Gilmore focused on unresolved performance issues in the current $55 billion development phase. These must be resolved before the aircraft can enter intense combat testing and the eventual deployment later this decade of fully capable combat jets.The Defense Department's F-35 program office ""has no plan to adequately fix and verify hundreds of these deficiencies using flight testing within its currently planned schedule and resources,"" Gilmore wrote. Deploying F-35s ""with capable mission systems is critical to our national security,"" but the program now ""is at high risk of sacrificing essential combat performance,"" he added.The Pentagon's office of independent cost analysis estimates that extending the development phase from its planned test flight completion in September 2017 to as late as into 2020 could cost as much as $1.12 billion more. The number is contained in the testing director's new annual report delivered to Pentagon leaders and lawmakers late Monday.The program office has said completing the phase will require about $530 million extra and acknowledges that it may slip to May 2018.Gilmore's annual report contains a 62-page assessment of the program that's a detailed primer for the incoming administration on deficiencies that include software, weapons accuracy, aircraft-carrier launching, the diagnostic system and reliability.Shares of Lockheed Martin finished trading Tuesday down 0.6% to 256.17.

But the new Trump administration is readying its own budget as it looks to back up campaign promises for major increases.Estimates: Analysts see flat earnings of $2.49 per share with revenue rising 4.1% to $5.39 billion.Results: EPS rose to $2.96 a share as sales climbed to $5.6 billion.Outlook: $11.30-$11.60 per share and sales of about $25 billion.

353,LMT,"Shares of General Dynamics (GD) popped to a record high and broke out into buy range after the defense giant offered a strong outlook over the coming years, lifting a sector that has offered cloudier forecasts for this year.Management on General Dynamics' earnings call said it was ""quite bullish on 2018 through 2020 in all segments."" The company forecast a 5.6% compound annual growth rate in revenue from 2016 through 2020, helped by an already-large backlog, which stood at $59.8 billion at the end of 2016.CFO Jason Aiken said on a conference call that GD sees ""notionally upward-directional budgets that underpin and support the defense programs across the board.""The bullish forecast from General Dynamics follows weaker ones from Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) this past week, as the industry awaits more details on defense spending from President Trump, who campaigned on stronger national security and a more aggressive approach to combating ISIS.Shares of General Dynamics, which makes tanks, Navy ships and Gulfstream business jets, jumped 4.4% to 185.12 on the stock market today, breaking out of a flat base with a 180.19 buy point.

Boeing dipped 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: While a Trump presidency bodes well for the defense industry, Trump hasn't shied away from pressuring companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin to cut costs on their Air Force One and F-35 programs, respectively.

354,LMT,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis is likely to face little opposition from the Democrats as President-elect Donald Trump's Defense Secretary nominee, and analysts expect his confirmation hearing Thursday to be more about Trump's policies and where Mattis stands.The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will likely grill Mattis on Iran, major procurement programs and civilian control of the Defense Department.Senators could ask about the Pentagon's commitment to buy more than 2,400 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.On Wednesday, Trump blasted the high costs of the F-35 and said there would more competition on fighter jets, implying Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet could get more orders.Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. John McCain has been critical of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, blasting the Air Force for failing to give more specific cost figures, and could bring it up with Mattis. The service has put development costs at $23.5 billion and per-plane costs at $564 million in 2016 dollars, but analysts have said the total acquisition costs are near $80 billion.Mattis could also be questioned on Trump's plan to expand the Navy and the often-criticized littoral combat ship, two types of which are being built by Lockheed and an Austal-General Dynamics (GD) team. The cost per ship nearly doubled and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Nuclear weapons may come up, as Trump has tweeted that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.""The Pentagon is looking to recapitalize its nuclear triad of land-based missiles, ballistic missile-launching submarines, and strategic bombers, in an effort costing hundreds of billions of dollars.But in the past, Mattis has questioned the need for land-based nuclear weapons and asked at a 2015 Senate hearing if it was ""time to reduce the triad to a diad"" as it ""would reduce the false alarm danger.""IBD'S TAKE: Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets but will he actually follow through with his spending ramp up?But most questions will likely focus on ""opening up some daylight between Mattis and Trump,"" according to Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""This will be the opportunity for the Democrats to express their concerns and disagreements with Trump's statements on a whole variety of subjects.""Democrats will also question some of Mattis' comments on Iran. Trump has said he wants to tear up the nuclear agreement, and this is where he and Mattis might see eye to eye. At a CSIS presentation last year, Mattis said Iran ""is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.""Other possible questions include Mattis' position on Trump's remarks that Japan should become a nuclear power and that the U.S. should pull support from NATO.Civilian control of the military will be another big topic at the hearing. The cabinet position is a civilian role, and Mattis would need Congress to waive the requirement to be retired from the military for at least seven years. Mattis has only been out since 2013.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said earlier she would vote against a wavier for Mattis.Democrats will be ""looking for assurance that Mattis will respect civilian control of the military and understands his new role as the head civilian in the department and not as an officer,"" Cancian said.RELATED: After Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk and sequester backer, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.The Air Force had earlier sought to retire the A-10 due to budget constraints but was under pressure from Congress to keep the plane in service as it has proven effective in the U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State.""Our feeling about the A-10 is that we would suggest certainly delaying the retirement of the A-10,"" she said. ""It's been extremely helpful in the fight overseas against ISIL, as well as for a presence in the Pacific and in Europe.""But eventually the venerable plane would need to be retired to give way to the next generation of planes, she added. The F-35 is one of the new planes expected to replace the A-10's close air-support capabilities.""The requirements of the F-35 are crucial and the program is coming along,"" James said.But Trump has blasted the high costs of Lockheed's $400 billion F-35 program, saying on Twitter (TWTR) that he asked Boeing to price out F/A-18 Super Hornets.James said comparing the two planes was like comparing ""apples to oranges"" and that the F-35 is needed in the Air Force's inventory.And as B-52s enter their sixth decade in service, the Air Force is looking at putting newer, more fuel-efficient engines on the heavy bomber to help reduce costs.Boeing shares edged up 0.25% to close at 159.10 on the stock market today.

358,LMT,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has been tapped as defense secretary, said Thursday that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter is key for the U.S. and its allies and supports having human pilots fly Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21 bomber.The F-35 — which has an acquisition price tag of about $400 billion for more than 2,400 planes — has come under sustained criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who again blasted the program Wednesday for being behind schedule and over budget. He also suggested the F-35 would face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.The F-35 ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane,"" Mattis said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, he added, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Top U.S. allies like the U.K., Israel, Italy and Australia are also partners on the F-35 program (which is in production) or are buyers.""Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on their F-35 program, and it bonds us closely together with them,"" Mattis said earlier.When asked about the B-21 Raider, he paused and said he supports a manned bomber. That program, which is in early development, has been criticized by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain for not being more transparent on its total acquisition costs, which analysts have put at $50 billion to $80 billion.Northrop's B-21 isn't currently being designed to be unmanned but that capability would be a consideration in the future, the Air Force said last year.Shares of Lockheed closed down 1% at 252.62 on the stock market today. Northrop, which is also a major F-35 subcontractor, fell 1% as well to finish at 229.15, and Boeing slipped 0.7% to 158.29.Mattis also voiced support for the recapitalization of U.S. nuclear assets, including the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine, which will replace Ohio-class ""boomers,"" as well as development of new ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.General Dynamics (GD) is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class subs, which are in the design phase. Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon (RTN) are expected to bid on the ICBM contract.But Mattis said he needs to look at the deterrence capabilities of the Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missile meant to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.

He also praised some automakers for U.S. investments.Trump said Wednesday that ""new bidding procedures"" are needed on drug prices, signaling his support for new legislation traditionally backed by Democrats and opposed by Republicans that could hit the sector's profits.""Our drug industry has been disastrous,"" he said. ""They're leaving left and right,'"" He also criticized the industry's heavy lobbying.""We're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.""Trump had previously signaled the drug industry was in his sights, saying shortly after the presidential election that he is ""going to bring down drug prices.""Amgen shares fell 1.4% to close at 156.62 on the stock market today, with nearly all the decline coming after Trump's remarks.

369,LMT,"After taking heat for years over its ballooning acquisition price tag, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is reportedly under scrutiny now for the cost to operate and maintain the new stealth fighters.XThe cost to procure 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy is about $400 billion. Meanwhile, the cost to operate the fleet over the course of its decades-long service life is estimated at $1.2 trillion.But the Pentagon's chief weapons tester has warned that figure is ""likely to increase significantly"" because the F-35's parts are more unreliable than expected and repairing the jets are taking longer than planned, according to Bloomberg.In a May presentation, the Pentagon's director of operational testing told officials that reliability metrics on ""critical failures have worsened over the last year."" And reliability metrics have fallen again since the May 8 presentation for the Air Force's F-35A and Marine Corps' F-35B variants. But metrics rose for the Navy's F-35C version, according to the report.The availability of spare parts is ""is getting worse, affecting fly rates"" in the more than 200 F-35s based across the U.S. Additionally, 20% of F-35s needing parts have to wait as suppliers struggle to keep up with replacing damaged parts while concurrently boosting production to accommodate the ramp-up of deliveries of new F-35s, according to the presentation.Spare part issues have weighed on fleetwide availability of F-35, which is at just 52% — well below the current goal of 60% and the 80% needed for combat testing expected to start next year.But F-35 Joint Program Office spokesman Joe DellaVedova told Bloomberg that the program is seeing a ""positive effect"" from improved spare-part forecasting and repair times.Lockheed shares rose 0.8% to 280.09 on the stock market today, bouncing higher from a test of their 50-day average but still in buy range. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a top subcontractor on the F-35, climbed 0.9% to 257.52, also still in buy range. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the F-35's engines, advanced 0.7% to 122.46, rising further above its buy zone.The F-35 program has already been struggling against availability issues. All F-35s were grounded earlier this month at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona because some pilots suffered oxygen deprivation issuesAnd last week, all Marine F-35s were grounded at Yuma Air Station in Arizona over software issues with its critical Autonomic Logistics Information System, which is needed for everything from mission planning to maintenance.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

371,LMT,"XAt the Paris Air Show Monday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) agreed to send its Texas-based F-16 production to India in an effort to secure a major fighter deal from New Delhi.A Lockheed spokesman said if India agrees to buy F-16s, and the U.S. government is also onboard, then the company would move the F-16 line to India.X Under an agreement with Tata Advanced Systems, Lockheed F-16 Block 70 fighters would be built in India instead of Fort Worth. Tata already builds airframe components for Lockheed's C-130J airlifter and the S-92 helicopter, according to the companies.While a joint press release said the deal would support ""thousands of Lockheed Martin and F-16 supplier jobs in the U.S.,"" it comes as the Trump administration has been pressing U.S. companies to expand production and employment domestically.But after talking with administration officials, Lockheed has grown more confident that the White House will back the plan.""We've briefed various members of the administration on the program, on what that program would mean for the United States and what it means for India, and throughout all of the briefings and discussions that we've done, we haven't seen any resistance to the program by the administration,"" Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed's aeronautics unit, told Defense News at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday.""Given that, 'yes,' for a short answer, we are feeling more comfortable with the administration. It doesn't see this program as an issue.""Lockheed Martin shares closed virtually flat at 282.99 on the stock market today, remaining within buy range, which maxes out at 283.50.The deal is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" initiative that requires a foreign partner to invest in Indian manufacturing. He plans to spend $150 billion on the military as part of the plan.Technology transfers and overseas production lines are becoming more common in military deals as defense giants look to keep older production lines in business and increase sales abroad.The deal would allow India to export the F-16 to other countries interested in the fourth-generation fighter. Over 3,000 F-16s are flow by 26 countries, according to the release.India is in dire need of new planes as its 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft are nearing the end of their service lives, and need to be replaced. A formal contest for 100-250 planes is expected to open soon.Sweden's Saab Gripen is also in the running for the deal but hasn't announced an Indian partner.In 2012, India chose Dassault to build 126 fighters but negotiations stalled. So India signed a deal worth nearly $9 billion for 36 Rafale fighter jets last year, beating out Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, Lockheed's F-16 and BAE's Eurofighter.Under that pact, France agreed invest 30% percent of the nearly $9 billion order cost in Indian military aviation research programs and another 20% in local production of Rafale parts.But New Delhi still sees a larger, follow-on order in the future, and Lockheed's agreement to move F-16 production to India could increase its odds of winning that deal.RELATED: Why Lockheed's F-35 Could Stun Crowds At The Paris Air ShowDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing Snags $30 Billion In Deals For New 737 Max 10 Jet

373,LMT,"Mohammed bin Salman, who is Saudi Arabia's new crown prince, could have a big impact on Exxon Mobil (XOM), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other U.S. companies' relations with the kingdom, as the 31-year-old is expected to add volatility to oil markets and push for buying more U.S. weapons.U.S.-Saudi relations cooled under President Obama, but President Trump has rekindled the relationship and announced weapons deals valued at $110 billion during his May visit, which was orchestrated in part by Salman.""Trump seems to be in good with the Saudis,"" said Ivan Eland, senior fellow and director of the Center on Peace & Liberty at the Independent Institute. ""They are one of his favorite dictatorships. U.S. business will definitely benefit from the military/political alliance we have there.""During Trump's visit last month, General Electric (GE) said it had agreements for $15 billion worth of projects in the kingdom, Dow Chemical (DOW) said it would build a polymer and coatings plant, and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) announced a joint venture to make specialty drilling rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia.Eland sees more infrastructure and tech deals on the horizon, and Salman is a key architect of the Saudi Vision 2030 program to diversify the economy and end the kingdom's dependence on oil revenues.Salman is somewhat of a known quantity in energy circles, making his mark in the spring of 2016, when he scuttled an oil deal at the last minute.""Oil traders are already aware of MBS and his brash personality,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, using Salman's initials in his daily energy report Wednesday. ""Last April, the 31-year-old basically pulled out of the Doha oil accord, angering both friends and foes alike, as they all came to sign an oil agreement that was already agreed to before seasoned OPEC and non-OPEC ministers came to sign on the dotted line.""Still, Salman has an incentive to lift oil prices, at least in the short term, as the kingdom shops around its state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco, for an initial public offering next year.Aramco is also reportedly looking to Chevron (CVX) to help develop gas reserves, and Exxon has a history of petrochemical joint ventures in Saudi Arabia.As defense minister, Salman has pushed for a stronger stance against Iran and increased air strikes in Yemen, and pushed for sanctions against Qatar.Arms sales to Saudi Arabia would go ""up, up and away"" under the hawkish young Salman, said Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.But business deals could come with a catch. Saudi Arabia will want foreign companies building products in the kingdom so Saudi Arabia can get licenses and jump-start its own industries, especially in defense, Eland said.Unlike defense orders to Asia with strings attached in the form of technology transfers, sales to the Middle East historically tended to be simpler, with Gulf allies shopping for off-the-shelf technology that they could use right away. In addition, cost was of little concern, especially when oil was more than $100 a barrel.Saudi Arabia still needs arms, but is now seeking tech transfers in the wake of crashing oil prices.During Trump's visit, for example, Lockheed signed a letter of intent with Saudi tech firm Taqnia to form a joint venture to support the completion of 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters.Over time, as Saudi Arabia develops a home-grown industrial base, fewer U.S. exports may be needed to fill demand.U.S. companies also might not have a monopoly on Saudi sales. Flaring tensions in the region has Riyadh looking at an unlikely ally as it plans to increase military spending by nearly 7% this year.""Keep an eye on Saudi relations with Israel,"" Bobbi said. ""I look at Israel as the silent broker in the Middle East, thanks in no small part to their technical prowess.""RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

374,LMT,"The Air Force has filed a report on restarting production of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 Raptor, and backers of the stealthy air-superiority fighter got shot down.The Obama administration canceled the program in 2009 amid spiraling costs, and the Air Force has maintained for years that restarting the program would be too expensive. It reiterated that stance Wednesday.The Air Force said buying 194 additional F-22s would cost about $50 billion, which includes $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up expenses and $40.4 billion for aircraft procurement. The price tag for each F-22 to be $206 million-$216 million.""The startup costs are significant and very expensive,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner. ""The chief has assigned a fighter roadmap. Our plan is to put any resources we have into that roadmap and not into restarting a line from an older aircraft.""Amid concerns that U.S. aircraft might lose their ability to dominate the airspace as Russian and Chinese rivals make advances, Congress asked the Air Force last year to produce a report on resurrecting the F-22.Lockheed shares edged up 10 cents to 282.99 on the stock market today, just within buy range of a 270 entry.The F-22 program produced 187 operational planes, less than half the 381 that the Air Force requested.The $200 million-plus unit cost for a new F-22 compares with the $140 million per-plane cost when production ended. Meanwhile, Lockheed is working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million under the latest contract.A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion-$17.4 billion in 2008 dollars, depending on a variety of factors. Earlier this year, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it could start building the F119 engines for the F-22 by December 2020.Instead of restarting the F-22, the Air Force has said it wants to focus investments on its three priorities: Lockheed F-35 fighters, Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bombers and Boeing (BA) KC-46 tankers.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

380,LMT,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky ""underwhelmed"" investors Tuesday after a meeting with President Trump reportedly fixated on tax and regulatory policies rather than drug pricing, Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said Wednesday.Gorsky was among a dozen business leaders Trump met with on his first full day in the White House, says Business Insider. Among them were Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Ford Motor (F) CEO Mark Fields and Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson.But Trump didn't focus on drug pricing, Gorsky told analysts on the company's Q4 earnings conference call. Trump has called out Big Pharma in recent weeks, saying they're ""getting away with murder"" by raising prices. Some studies have shown pharmaceuticals raise their product prices by 10% annually, on average.Monday's meeting had a different tenor, Gorsky said. ""It really focused more on overall economic growth and, as we mentioned earlier, one of the things around tax, regulatory and other policies, and that those are really the major drivers of the conversation,"" he said on the call.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson had seven drugs approved from 2012-16.

Johnson & Johnson is currently working to acquire European biotech Actelion. At one time, Sanofi (SNY) was reportedly interested in buying Actelion, but didn't issue a formal bid.On Tuesday, J&J executives wouldn't comment on the exclusive talks with Actelion. But comments on the call suggest J&J will pursue deals in 2017, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in his research report.""While our expectation of a deal announcement in conjunction with earnings did not materialize,"" said Novarro, ""management's comments on the call suggest that Johnson & Johnson will remain active on the M&A front in 2017.""He kept his outperform rating on J&J stock, but lowered his price target to 128 from 133.On the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock rose 0.9% to 112.80, after falling 1.9% on Tuesday.RELATED:J&J Hep C Sales Dip To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead, Merck, Alexion 2017 Views Hazy; Biogen May Surge: AnalystJohnson & Johnson In Exclusive Talks To Acquire Actelion After Sanofi Fray

383,LMT,"American taxpayers could soon find out if they got their money's worth from the costliest fighter jets in the U.S. arsenal, as new air-defense systems render the legacy fleet too vulnerable to lead the charge in contested airspace.XRussia's S-400 system, which is deployed in Syria and spreading to other U.S. adversaries, poses a particular threat to ""fourth generation"" aircraft like the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18. Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities.""Fourth gen will continue to have a role in some of these other areas we are looking,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris — the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements — after a Senate hearing in March. ""But, again, as the world grows and these threats proliferate in Syria and Iran and other locations, they are going to push fourth gen out quicker than planned.""The accelerated threat assessment comes as President Trump looks to add at least 100 combat aircraft to the U.S. fleet. He hasn't specified which models will be in the mix but has been critical of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition price tag, hinting it could be pitted against Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and saying in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order.""The implications for the defense industry extend beyond Lockheed's F-35, which several U.S. allies are buying in addition to the 2,443 the Pentagon is procuring for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.Boeing is trying to maintain a foothold in the combat aircraft market after losing the B-21 bomber contract to Northrop, and wants to keep its Super Hornet in production despite international demand for more advanced fighters. And last year, Congress asked the Air Force to assess the costs of restarting Lockheed's F-22 program, which was canceled in 2009 less than halfway through its production run due to spiraling costs.For now, the still-limited availability of fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 means the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet will continue to be older planes. The Air Force said earlier this month that it will extend the service life of the F-16 by 50% to 12,000 flight hours as the service hopes to keep the plane flying until the 2040s. And Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein recently sounded ambivalent about retiring the F-15 next decade as planned.IBD'S TAKE: The Aerospace/Defense industry group ranked No. 63 Monday among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. While that is down from earlier this year, top defense stocks like Lockheed Martin, Northrop and Raytheon are in buy zones.While U.S. airspace dominance has gone unquestioned for decades, the S-400's introduction has helped tip the scales, and growing tensions with Russia and its allies are making the skies above the Middle East more dangerous.After the U.S. launched Raytheon (RTN) Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase April 6 in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces, the Kremlin vowed to deploy more air defenses to Syria ""very soon,"" according to Russia's Interfax.And on Monday, Russia threatened to target U.S.-led coalition aircraft and drones in Syria after a Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 that had bombed positions near a U.S.-backed militia combating the Islamic State.""All flying objects, including planes and drones of the international coalition, detected west of the Euphrates, will be followed by Russian air defense systems as targets,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.Before the Tomahawk strike, the U.S. had avoided Assad's military. But with the U.S. mission in Syria possibly expanding, American pilots may find themselves intentionally or unintentionally in the S-400's cross hairs.Russia already has one of its S-400 systems in western Syria near Turkey, but it's possible another could be among those deployed to beef up Syrian defenses. Meanwhile, Syrian forces have moved most of their fixed-wing aircraft to Russia's Khmeimim airbase, where the S-400 is also deployed, for protection against another U.S. strike.Russia claims the system can track 300 targets simultaneously and has an operational range of up to 250 nautical miles. China finalized an order for the S-400 in 2015 with delivery expected next year, and an even more advanced S-500 is in the works. Moscow may be exaggerating the S-400's details. But what's widely accepted is that it represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges.The S-400's radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS. A stealth fighter, however, would only be detectable at close range.The F-22 has 360-degree stealth, while the infrared signature of the F-35's engine makes it more vulnerable from the back, Bobbi noted. Still, he thinks the F-35 ""would lead the parade"" if and when it's deployed to Syria.Even before this month's Tomahawk missile strikes, the shift in the threat landscape was already becoming clear.""We think the only thing that can operate in and through that environment is going to be fifth generation,"" Harris told reporters after the March Senate hearing.F-22s are currently flying in Syria, where they flew their first-ever combat missions in 2014 as the U.S. began hitting Islamic State targets. The Air Force said earlier this year that F-35s will deploy to the Middle East in a few years but have demonstrated their readiness to deploy with recent exercises in Europe and Asia.For more on top business trends and how to make more money in the stock market, follow IBD on Facebook.Maintaining a military edge comes at a cost. The Trump administration has vowed to boost Pentagon spending but is also scrutinizing individual programs.Earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35's costs as well as options for upgrading F/A-18 Super Hornets. The basic F-35A model costs about $95 million each under the latest production contract, but versions for the Navy and Marines are more expensive. The current Super Hornet version costs $52 million to $61 million, depending on the model.By the time F-22 production ended, the per-plane cost was about $140 million, though total procurement topped $60 billion to get 187 planes in operation. Advocates periodically have called for making more, even though Lockheed has shut down the production line. A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion to $17.4 billion in 2008 dollars. The Air Force has maintained that a restart would be too expensive and would take away resources from the F-35 and other programs.To be sure, fifth-generation fighters aren't invincible — and aren't invisible.""Even fifth generation would be challenged to penetrate in certain ranges against these very capable air-missile-defense systems,"" said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired Air Force colonel, noting China has developed its own ""very advanced"" HQ-9 air-defense system.But he said the S-400 wouldn't create ""no-go zones"" for the U.S. and allies.And a trade-off of stealth fighters is that maintaining a low-observable radar profile means they can't carry as many missiles and bombs under their wings. As a result, fourth-generation fighters can bring more firepower, and there are ways to reduce their detectability too.Boeing has proposed a stealthier version of the Super Hornet, which would have a special radar-evading coating and wouldn't have fuel tanks under the wings, Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, said at an industry conference earlier this month.He added that the advanced Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long-range infrared search-and-track system and deeper magazine that holds more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant can.Fourth-generation fighters won't be obsolete and should continue playing a key role in combat as part of a one-two punch with their stealthier counterparts.Lockheed's website describes the F-35 as the ""quarterback"" of a joint strike force that can ""share what it sees with other aircraft to expand situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft.""Also, pitting a plane against an air-defense system or other threat in a head-to-head competition is the ""wrong way to think,"" said Gunzinger.Instead, the focus should be on how fifth- and fourth-generation fighters — along with jamming aircraft like Boeing's EA-18G Growler, cyber operations and unmanned systems — can work together to take down a threat, he added.""It's a family of systems,"" said the Air Force's Harris. ""It's going to be our fifth generation that goes into a threat environment like that and kick down the door. And then maybe after those threats have been suppressed, allow fourth generation back into the fight.""RELATED:As F-35 Raises Its Profile, How Do You Stop Russian Intel Gathering?F-35s Are Back From Europe: Here's What The Air Force Said Lockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North ThreatensBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

385,LMT,"The flurry of passenger-jet deals announced at the Paris Air Show typically overshadows developments on the military side, but Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 looks to put on a dazzling show, despite initial reports that the stealthy fighter jet wasn't invited.At last year's Farnborough Airshow in the U.K., the F-35 wowed audiences with its ability to hover in midair and even fly backwards.But the F-35 flight demonstrations in Paris this year will include the kind of circus acrobatics and high-G maneuvers that are seen at Blue Angels or Thunderbirds shows, an Air Force spokesman told Defense News.Such a display would come as future sales to more European countries could be a hot topic.""Germany in particular"" is interested in the F-35, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group.Last month, Germany's military asked the Pentagon for a classified briefing on the F-35, as that country looks to replace its existing fighter fleet starting next decade, according to Reuters.In March, Lockheed said it was discussing F-35 sales with the governments of Spain, Switzerland and Belgium. Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and the U.K. are already European foreign partners on the jet.Other European countries got a good look at the F-35 earlier this year. Eight Air Force F-35A variants from the 34th Fighter Squadron deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia and Bulgaria as a show of force in the region, and to test the procedures and logistics of moving the F-35 around the area.Boeing (BA) aircraft will also be on display at Paris, including the P-8A anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft; the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft; the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter; and the CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter.But European rival Airbus (EADSY) may enjoy home field advantage.""If there is any upside on the defense side it would probably be for Airbus,"" Aboulafia said.

386,LMT,"It's still business as usual for Qatar as Washington signed a preliminary agreement to sell it $12 billion in Boeing (BA) F-15 fighters Wednesday despite President Trump accusing Doha of funding terrorist groups.The deal is for reportedly for 36 jets, after the Obama administration approved a possible sale for up to 72 jets for $21.1 billion last year. Qatari Defense Minister Khalid Al-Attiyah met with his U.S. counterpart, James Mattis, to sign the agreement Wednesday.""The $12 billion sale will give Qatar a state of the art capability and increase security cooperation and interoperability between the United States and Qatar,"" a Pentagon spokesman told CNN.Obama had been hesitant of the deal over concerns that it didn't fit into America's defense strategy in the region and Israel was worried about the weapons falling into the wrong hands.Shares of Boeing, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 1.6% to close at a fresh record high of 195.45 on the stock market today, climbing above buying range. Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares edged up 0.2% and Northrop Grumman (NOC) dipped 0.4%. Both are still in buy range.The deal comes after Trump called out Qatar for being ""a funder of terrorism at a very high level"" and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with D0ha.But Qatari officials believe the F-15 sales show that the U.S. is still an ally in the region, despite Trump's comments. The U.S. has a major military base in Qatar.""This is of course proof that U.S. institutions are with us but we have never doubted that,"" a Qatari official in Doha told Retuers. ""Our militaries are like brothers.

388,LMT,"Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets, but analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.During his campaign, Trump said he would eliminate the ""sequester"" budget constraints on the Pentagon and increase spending. But after the election, Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk and sequester backer, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.""I'm very tempered in the kind of new money I would expect to see in any so-called buildup,"" and the defense industry should ""restrain expectations,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.And despite Trump's aggressive campaign talk on defense, he has signaled reluctance to pay up, blasting the costs of Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. After his Twitter (TWTR) rants, top defense stocks gave up their postelection gains and haven't recovered.Wall Street expects Q4 numbers to show that growth at Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon picked up in 2016, but it sees a slowdown in 2017, though that could change when the White House's plans become clearer.Analysts and investors will get their first look at Trump's spending priorities when he submits a defense supplemental budget request within his first 100 days. In the spring, the fiscal 2018 budget proposal comes out. And later in the year, the administration will lay out the Pentagon's next five-year plan.Trump has said he wants to grow the Army by 60,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps by 12,000 Marines as well as boost the Navy's fleet by 78 to 350 ships and add at least 100 combat aircraft at the Air Force.More troops mean the Pentagon will spend more on pay, health care, chow halls and housing. Those costs could crowd out demand for big-budget ground weapons, like a new armored vehicle to replace the Army's Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks, meaning limited upside for defense contractors hoping for lucrative deals.But targeting a certain fleet size means more Navy ships have to be ordered.Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees Trump adding more next-generation attack submarines, noting that the Virginia-class sub is already in serial production and should avoid Trump's ire.""They don't have the same problems that have been the subject of those tweets,"" Cancian told IBD. ""Those were programs that have had or have the prospects of significant cost increases.""But new Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines could come under fire eventually, as their overall costs become more apparent, he added.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII) are building the Virginia-class subs, while GD is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class ""boomers,"" which are in the design phase.IBD'S TAKE: The defense industry isn't the only one falling prey to Trump's tweet storms. Trump attacked General Motors for sending Mexican-made cars to U.S. dealers and threatened to levy big import taxes on cars built outside the U.S.Trump has also been a proponent of strengthening America's nuclear arsenal, tweeting last month that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability"" and called for an arms race as Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly looks for missiles that can evade countermeasures.So the ballistic-missile subs, along with Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider, could be safe from attack, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.Meanwhile, the Air Force's request for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system as well as Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles will also likely be funded.""Those are probably the two programs that are on the edge, and my guess is that (Trump) would buy both of those, whereas a Democratic administration might not have,"" Cancian said.The estimated cost of the ICBM program is $62 billion over 30 years, but reports say the Air Force's estimate is billions of dollars short. The LRSO plan's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two programs, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded this year.Another Air Force priority is the F-35, and Trump's pledge to give the Air Force 100 more combat aircraft could help the program, despite his suggestion that Lockheed's orders may be reduced in favor of more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets.The Air Force is getting more than 70% of the Pentagon's total procurement of 2,443 F-35s, and it doesn't currently fly the Super Hornet, making it an unlikely addition to the service's fleet.The F-35 is also in production, and costs are already falling as output increases. IHS Markit's Bobbi said Trump will still likely fund the F-35 program after getting further price reductions.And flying under the radar is the Air Force's $16 billion T-X program for 350 trainer aircraft, which Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are seeking. Bobbi said Trump ""has bigger fish to fry.""Israel is also buying the F-35 and recently increased its order amid a wider rebound in international defense spending as regional tensions in the Middle East, Asia and Europe intensify.Despite funding pressure from lower oil prices, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states will invest in more weapons systems as Iran is expected to update its arsenal. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain already have F-15s and Super Hornets on order from Lockheed and Boeing.Cancian sees Japan and South Korea buying more missile defense systems from the U.S. as China adds military hardware to its man-made islands in the South China Seas and North Korea tests more nuclear warheads and missiles. South Korea plans to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system later this year, and Japan is considering it as well.IHS Jane's expects defense investment in the Baltic states to double over the next two years and Western European spending to ""strengthen over the next decade"" on Trump's threats to pull out of NATO unless other members contributed more.""Defense spending returned to a healthy rate of growth in 2016, kicking off what we expect to be a decade of stronger global defense spending,"" said Fenella McGerty, principal analyst at IHS Jane's, in a release. ""Defense spending should recover to pre-financial-crisis levels by 2018.""RELATED: Battle Stations!

390,LMT,"Ford (F) canceled plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, hours after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to levy hefty import taxes on cars built outside the U.S., as he accused General Motors (GM) of sending Mexican-made Chevy Cruzes to U.S. car dealers tax free on Tuesday.Trump threatened Ford last year with higher taxes as it looked to move its Focus-model production to Mexico. On Tuesday, Ford said it will invest $700 million to expand a Michigan plant, where it will create 700 jobs and build its new autonomous and electric vehicles.Ford had announced the Mexico plans in April, saying it sought to improve profitability on its small cars, and drew criticism from then-candidate Trump at the time. But CEO Mark Fields refused to back down.On Tuesday, he said he's encouraged by Trump's pro-growth agenda, while noting that the decision to cancel the new Mexico plant was due primarily to weaker demand for small cars. The Focus will instead be made at an existing plant in Mexico.Fields told CNN that the move is a ""vote of confidence"" in Trump's pledge to create a pro-business climate in the U.S., but insisted that Ford ""didn't cut a deal"" with the president elect.Among U.S. automakers, GM has the bigger footprint in Mexico and relies less on U.S. production.In 2015, 63% of GM's North American output came from the U.S., vs. 80% for Ford and 64% for Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), according to IHS Automotive.GM's plans for the Cruze in Mexico were just part of $5 billion in investments that it planned to make in that country by 2018.General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017But a report last week from the Youngstown, Ohio, Vindicator said GM already announced that it would cut jobs at its assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and halt the import of Mexican built Cruzes to the U.S.GM said in an emailed statement that ""All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.""The company told CNBC that it sold 190,000 Cruzes in the U.S. in 2016, stressing that just 2.4% were made in Mexico, some 4,500 hatchbacks.The next-generation model Cruze will be made in Mexico, but for export markets, shifting production from South Korea.Ford shares rallied 3.8% to 12.59 on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. GM stock edged up 0.9%.Kansas City Southern (KSU) fell 4.8% on the Ford news to 80.80, its worst close since last February. Ford's Mexico plant was going to be set up next to one of KSU's U.S.-Mexico rail lines.This is just the latest time that Trump attacked businesses on Twitter.Earlier he blasted ""out of control costs"" with the Boeing (BA) Air Force One program and the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35. IBD'S TAKE: What other high ticket defense programs could Trump attack next?He met with Boeing and Lockheed's CEOs after the tweets and claimed to have gotten better deal after talking with Boeing's Dennis Muilenberg.But Trump is already close with GM's CEO Mary Barra as Barra is a member of Trump's strategic and policy forum, a group of CEOs that advises him on economic policy.And Trump said he helped United Technologies (UTX) Carrier unit keep 1,000 jobs at an Indiana plant that were scheduled to move to Mexico.Boeing shares rose 0.8%.

392,LMT,"First, President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program, then he targeted Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and suggested that the Pentagon might buy more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.So what Pentagon program could be next to get the Trump treatment?Trump has said he would build up the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from its current 272, but the ramp-up would come at a high cost.Lockheed could be in Trump's crosshairs again. It is building the littoral combat ship, while a separate team made up of Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) is building a different version of the LCS. The ships are designed to operate in coastal — or littoral — waters.The program is already coming under scrutiny, and earlier this month Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasted the Navy for spending $12.4 billion on 26 ships. The cost per ship has nearly doubled to $478 million, and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Trump must decide if the Navy will purchase 12 more of the ships for a total cost of $14 billion.Lockheed shares fell 0.5% at 249.56 on the stock market today. General Dynamics dipped 0.9%.Huntington Ingalls (HII) is currently building the USS John F. Kennedy, a second Ford-class aircraft carrier, with a projected cost of $11.35 billion.Among a list of options, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this month that the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers after the current ship is completedCanceling just one carrier would free up funds to buy less-expensive, smaller ships to achieve Trump's goal of boosting the size of the fleet.Huntington Ingalls shares were off 0.7%.Trump wants to build up America's nuclear arsenal, but that won't come cheaply either.The cost of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, is a big question mark as the Air Force has declined to give specific figures, saying U.S. adversaries would be able to infer its capabilities.McCain has been critical of that approach, arguing that taxpayers deserve to know how much they are spending on the plane.The Air Force has put the development cost for the long range strike bomber at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts estimate the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Northrop shares edged 0.6% lower to 231.92.America's nuclear missiles are nearing the end of their life spans and need to be replaced.Over the summer, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's Minuteman system.The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" according to a Bloomberg report.The Air Force also needs Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace its Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. The program will likely come at a cost of $20 billion to $30 billion.RELATED: Here's Where Lockheed Could Lose F-35 Orders To Boeing F/A-18sAfter Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'

394,LMT,"Small business owners' optimism soared in December to the highest level since 2004, the National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday, as President-elect Trump unleashes ""animal spirits"" on Main Street, even as corporate titans such as General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) tread carefully with the president-elect.NFIB's small business optimism index shot up 7.4 points to 105.8, the best reading since December 2004. It was the biggest monthly gain in decades. A net 50% of smaller firms see business conditions improving vs. 12% in November and -7% in October.""We haven't seen numbers like this in a long time,"" said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan. ""Small business is ready for a breakout, and that can only mean very good things for the U.S. economy.""Stock markets have taken off since Election Day — the Nasdaq hit a fresh high Tuesday — as investors bet that Trump's agenda for corporate tax reform and deregulation will boost the economy. Investor, business and consumer optimism suggests a revival of ""animal spirits,"" a term coined by famed economist John Maynard Keynes on how companies' confidence can fuel investment and spending.The share of small firms saying now is a good time to expand is triple what's normally seen in an expansion.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are among the few sectors that should benefit from Trump's fiscal plans and Federal Reserve rate hike.But there are concerns on Wall Street about Trump's protectionist instincts and his zeal for praising or criticizing individual companies — and how they respond.Trump last week criticized General Motors for selling Mexico-made Chevy Cruze cars in the U.S., as well as plans by Toyota (TM) to set up a plant in Mexico with plans to export Corollas to America. Ford, which also has come under fire from Trump for its Mexico ventures, scrapped a $1.6 billion Mexico plant. Since his election, Trump has criticized the cost of contracts for new Air Force One jets by Boeing (BA) as well as the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter jet.Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma on Monday became the latest tech titan to visit Trump Tower, following a Trump tech summit with the heads of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and many others late last month.Trump has called on Apple to bring back iPhone production to the U.S., a move that would undoubtedly make the smartphone far more expensive. Apple on Monday requested to make ""finished products"" and use ""high tech manufacturing"" at a Mesa, Ariz., site. Apple already has permission to make various components at the plant.It's unclear how much Trump's high-profile tweets and other remarks have actually influenced corporate strategy, though the president-elect has been quick to take credit for any decisions that seem to show businesses following his lead.Ford will still make small cars for U.S. export in Mexico, but from an existing plant. And that switch may have to do with declining demand for smaller sedans, which are less profitable in any case.Regardless, Trump's protectionist, highly public management isn't an issue for small businesses. Smaller firms export and import far less than s&P 500 giants, and there's little risk that the incoming president will target a mom-and-pop operation in Topeka, Kansas. Also, corporate tax cuts could especially benefit smaller firms, who have less scope and expertise to adopt global tax avoidance strategies like Apple and other multinationals.November's NFIB survey also showed notable increases, with postelection responses particularly strong. December's results confirm that bounce, with newfound optimism continuing to rise.A net 31% expect sales to rise, up 20 points from November and 30 points from October. Now 29% of small firms are planning on more capital expenditures.Sixty-three percent of small businesses boosted capital spending, up 8 points from November.""Business owners are feeling better about taking risks and making investments,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said.However, hiring plans remain lackluster. Job creation increased by 0.01 worker per firm in December and job openings dropped two points, NFIB said. It cited tight labor markets and a lack of qualified staff.The National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index for December sprinted to its highest level since 2005, even with higher mortgage rates making housing less affordable for new buyers, creating a headwind for demand and prices.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index leapt to a 10-year high in December, even with Democrats turning gloomy. The January IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index will be released on Wednesday.RELATED:Alibaba Founder Ma Describes Trump Meeting As Very ProductiveTrump Praises Ford, Chrysler, But GM Bypasses U.S. In GMC MoveEconomic Optimism Hits 10-Year High On Trump, But Democrats Are Blue

395,LMT,"President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion late Thursday that cost overruns on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could result in orders for Boeing's (BA) older and less capable F/A-18 Super Hornet only makes sense for the Navy, according to a Drexel Hamilton analyst.Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Earlier this month, Trump blasted the F-35 program for having ""out of control"" costs. On Monday, Pentagon officials said costs for successive production batches have been coming down and will continue to fall. On Wednesday, he met with Lockheed's CEO. But Trump's latest tweet keeps the heat on the defense contractor.""In our view, the F-35 could be shaping up to be the biggest target for defense savings through President-elect Donald Trump's term in office,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Pete Skibitski wrote in a note Friday.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the Pentagon is buying 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force (1,763), Navy (340) and Marine Corps (340), with U.S. allies buying hundreds more.The Super Hornet lacks short-takeoff and vertical-landing capabilities so is likely not a good fit for the Marine Corps, and the Air Force doesn't fly the plane now so it's unlikely to fit in there, Skibitski noted. But the Navy, which already has a large number of Super Hornets in its fleet, represents the biggest risk for Lockheed.Each Super Hornet costs roughly $50 million, which is about 40% cheaper than the F-35's projected $85 million unit cost by 2019.Skibitski estimates that if the Navy goes with the F/A-18, it would jeopardize $28.9 billion for Lockheed and the company would lose 6% a year in earnings before interest and taxes over the next decade.Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 249.54 on the stock market today, moving back below their 50-day line. Boeing shares climbed 0.2%. Major F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was off 0.4%, while F-35 engine supplier United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.2%.Skibitski also pointed out ""there is a clear technology difference"" between the F-35 and Super Hornet. The stealthy F-35 is a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet doesn't have stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.And the Pentagon can't just award Boeing a fighter contact without holding a new competition.""The government would be violating the law to award a contract to Boeing without a competition unless they go through exceptions to the normal legal requirements for competition,"" Daniel Gordon, the Obama administration's administrator for federal procurement policy, told the Wall Street Journal. RELATED: Trump Seeks To Cancel Air Force One Order, Targets Boeing ProfitTrump Goes Nuclear, But This Time Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rise

Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major F-35 subcontractors, lost about 1%.Earlier this month, Lockheed and Boeing were targets of Trump, who called the F-35's costs ""out of control"" and vowed to cancel Boeing's Air Force One replacement jets due to the cost.The CEOs of both companies met with Trump on Wednesday, and Boeing promised to keep the cost of the Air Force One program below $4 billion.On Monday, the F-35's program office told reporters that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly."" The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, said Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.With its stealth technology and advanced system integration and avionics, the F-35 is considered a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet lacks stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.Boeing's export opportunities for the Super Hornet have been challenged as countries wait for the more advanced F-35. But last month Canada said it is buying 18 Super Hornets as a stopgap measure after backing away from a decision to buy the F-35 and, instead, restarting a fighter competition. Kuwait is also buying 32 Super Hornets, while Israel added to its F-35 purchase.

397,LMT,"President-elect Donald Trump appeared to challenge Russia to a nuclear arms race Friday after tweeting Thursday that the U.S. must strengthen its nuclear arsenal.During a phone interview with MSNBC, he said, ""Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,"" according to ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski.A Trump spokesman has since tried to downplay the remark.His latest comment also followed a nuclear call to arms Thursday from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is seeking missiles that can evade countermeasures.""We need to strengthen the strategic nuclear forces, for that we should develop missiles capable of penetrating any current and prospective missile defense systems,"" Putin said at a defense ministry meeting, according to Tass news agency.On Friday, he said during a news conference, ""We will never get dragged into an arms race where we spend resources that we can't afford.""America's nuclear triad of air-, land- and sea-based delivery systems is nearing the end of its life span and needs to be replaced.

The Air Force has put the development-phase cost for the B-21 at $23.5 billion, but analysts have estimated the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.The Navy's program to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles, will cost the service $100 billion.Lockheed shares closed down 1.3% on the stock market today.

399,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. — President-elect Donald Trump has Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in his cross hairs as an example of ""out of control"" costs at the Pentagon, but the Joint Strike Fighter's program office said Monday that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly.""Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said Trump's transition team hadn't been briefed by the program office before his tweet about the cost last week. The team has since called to ask more about it, but a meeting hasn't been ""fully scheduled yet.""""I have no doubt that given the controversy over the F-35 program over the years that there is a perception the program is out of control as the first F-35s cost twice as much as we thought they were going to. That's in the past,"" Bogdan told reporters at a briefing.If given the chance to speak to Trump, he would give ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" about the $400 billion stealth fighter program.Under last month's $6.1. billion contract with Lockheed for the ninth batch of 57 F-35s, the cost for the Air Force's A model fell 5.5% to $102.1 million vs. the eighth lot, and the Marines' B model fell 1.8% to $131.6 million.But the Navy's C model rose 2.5% to $132.2 million as two fewer jets were ordered in lot nine.The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, Bogdan said.Meanwhile, updating the Autonomic Logistics Information System, the so called brains of the plane, has been ""harder than expected,"" he added.The software will be fielded in February, two months later than anticipated, and issues with insulation on coolant lines have caused production to slow down and won't be caught up until August 2017.Lockheed shares closed up 0.8% on the stock market today. Shares of United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt and Whitney division makes the engines for the fighter, rose 2% on an analyst upgrade. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the F-35, edged up 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: The F-35 wasn't the only program to come under fire from Trump. He first threatened to cancel Boeing's Air Force One program.Despite Monday's gains, shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTN) have yet to recover from Trump's F-35 criticism last week, as analysts see high-profile weapons programs coming under more scrutiny.Earlier Monday at an Atlantic Council event, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she had met with the transition team and explained that ""it's not quite as easy as it seems to get these costs down,"" according to reports.RELATED:Navy Faces Carrier Jet Shortfall, Reportedly Looking At More Super HornetsIsrael Thinks Lockheed F-35s Are Still Awesome, Will Buy More

400,LMT,"The chief executives from Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) sought to improve ties with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday after he criticized contracts that they have with the Pentagon.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg, after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said his company could get the Air Force One planes completed for less than $4 billion.""We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens,"" Muilenberg told reporters.Trump later spoke, saying he plans to cut a ""tremendous amount"" off the contract. ""It's a dance, it's a little bit of a dance,"" he said.Trump previously took aim at Boeing on Twitter (TWTR) for the cost of its Air Force One replacement and threatened to cancel the contract. He later told reporters, ""the plane is totally out of control. ... We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.""Boeing had previous signaled it could cut the price of the presidential jets, if the government curbs its extensive security and communications requirements.Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson also met with Trump on Wednesday.Trump recently tweeted that Lockheed's F-35 ""program and cost is out of control"" and promised to save money on other contracts after he is sworn in.On Monday Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, defended the program by saying that out-of-control cost overruns were ""in the past"" and said the Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the next lots of F-35s with Lockheed and expects the cost for each of the three variants to fall 6%-7%.Trump also met with various generals and admirals Wednesday.On Monday, Boeing announced that it would cut 8% of its commercial plane division by year-end, up from prior forecasts, with more cuts on the way. That came a week after hiking its dividend by 30% and setting a $14 billion buyback.Boeing shares closed up 0.7% to 157.48 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares dipped 0.5% to 252.52.Trump's meeting with the major aerospace and defense contractors comes a week after Trump's tech summit with the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA) and many others.Meanwhile, Peter Navarro, an economist and China critic, will lead the National Trade Council, a new White House trade initiative under the upcoming Trump administration.RELATED:Boeing Expands Job Cuts After Big Dividend Hike, $14 Billion Buyback

401,LMT,"Boeing (BA) plans to reduce its commercial-aircraft workforce by 8% by the end of this year with more reductions coming next year, according to reports of a company memo, as European rival Airbus (EADSY) grabs market share.That also comes a week after the aerospace giant announced a 30% dividend hike and a $14 billion stock buyback program.Boeing had signaled earlier this year that it would cut about 4.8% from the commercial division this year, with management reportedly telling workers that the Airbus A321neo was ""stealing massive orders from the 737,"" which makes up the bulk of Boeing's sales.The 8% cut this year, which includes a 10% reduction of executives and managers, was billed as a way to increase overall competitiveness, Reuters reported.The 2017 reduction is expected to be voluntary but Boeing could resort to involuntary cuts, according to Dow Jones.Boeing shares finished 1.1% higher at 156.18 on the stock market today, rising further above buy range after an October breakout.The layoffs come amid several changes for Boeing. Last month, the company named Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric's (GE) aviation business, to head the commercial unit.Production rates for the current-generation 777 are also set to slow as the company gears up for the 777X, and demand for the 747 is waning.Meanwhile, Boeing said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max in response to the A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air shares are both near record highs, but the carriers will end their code-sharing alliance next April.And the election of Donald Trump has proved to be another question mark for Boeing. While the stock has rallied since Election Day, Trump's anti-trade stance could result in some blowback for Boeing's export orders, and his skepticism on big-ticket defense spending could hit Boeing's military programs.Trump has criticized plans for new Air Force One plans with Boeing and decried the cost of the F-35 fighter jet by Lockheed Martin (LMT).But shares of Pentagon contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) have suffered more, as Boeing is seen as less exposed to the defense budget.Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Raytheon shares rose 0.8%.RELATED:Boeing Sets $16.6 Billion, 80-Jet Iran Air Deal, Still Curbs 777 ProductionLockheed's F-35 Isn't Stealthy Enough To Avoid Trump's Latest Attack

402,LMT,"As president-elect, Donald Trump is pro-business and a champion of corporate tax cuts — not to mention, anti-free trade and a big-company bully.That's a disorienting mix for chief executive officers trying to suss out whether Trump in the White House will be a blessing or bad luck. Planning ahead is no easy task when the next commander in chief is a guy with a hair-trigger Twitter finger who touts policies that could both help and hurt U.S. companies. Many said in interviews that they're cautiously optimistic — and a tad nervous.""I've got a great deal of confidence with the new administration coming in,"" Manny Chirico, CEO of apparel giant PVH Corp., said on Bloomberg Television, adding in the next breath, ""You have to be concerned about some of the talk and the rhetoric on trade.""The challenge is anticipating what Trump will do once in office. Will he crack down on immigration, dealing a blow to labor markets for restaurants, retail and construction? Hike tariffs on foreign-made goods and exit trade deals, which would be a hit to companies from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE)? Push to slash tax rates and ease regulations, things business tends to like?""I don't think anyone has any idea what to expect,"" said David Yermack, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""Companies have to make educated guesses about what may happen when, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty.""Prepping for Trump's four years has added a new plank to public-relations strategy and the assessment of reputational risk. At PR firm Weber Shandwick, Liz Cohen, an executive vice president for financial communications, said she's advising clients to perform vulnerability analyses just as they would for outspoken activist investors.""Clearly, in this environment, it's important companies take a look at what parts of the business could be criticized,"" Cohen said.Such is the power of the Trump Twitter feed, with its 17.3 million followers. He's been using it to harass companies just as he did Hillary Clinton and his GOP primary rivals. A CEO can be thrust into the news cycle with no warning.""That's a little bit unnerving,"" said Southwest Airlines' (LUV) Gary Kelly. ""There is some volatility there. We just don't know where the bully pulpit is going to come from.""Lockheed Martin (LMT) was a recent target, slammed in a tweet for what the president-elect said were out-of-control costs for the F-35 fighter jet. The immediate fallout was painful, with the tweet sending the stock down 2.5% and erasing almost $2 billion in market value.In fact, Trump's gripe with Lockheed caused drops in other defense contractors, which had been rallying in anticipation his administration would boost defense spending, considering he said when he was campaigning that he wanted to beef up the number of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes.Whatever the industry, ""a lot of guys are thinking, 'Oh man, I don't want him tweeting about me and my company,""' said Ken Lowe, chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), which owns lifestyle-oriented websites and cable-television channels. And there's no telling who Trump will assail next.""A lot of us also think, 'That's one day. What's he on to tomorrow?'"" said Lowe.General Electric's (GE) Jeffrey Immelt said many chief executives would gladly accept fleeting bad publicity in exchange for the tax reform and job creation the next president may bring. Immelt said he's not worried about getting in the man's cross hairs — and that he keeps a sharp eye on @realDonaldTrump.""Sure,"" he said with a laugh during an exchange last week with reporters in New York. ""Who doesn't?""Bosses should totally get what Trump's doing when he calls a company on the carpet, because it's what so many of them do within their own operations. He's acting just like a CEO, Lowe said, by publicly asking, ""Why are you spending so much money?""In the corporate world, ""it's been an effective strategy,"" said Davia Temin, founder of the crisis-management company Temin & Co. ""It will be a fascinating experience to see how things that have worked inside global organizations translate to the political arena.""For all that, the victim of a Twitter pounce must be careful, she said.""Never start a press war with someone who can outgun you,"" Temin said. ""A CEO could choose to have a battle of the titans and fight back. That is a strategy, but not one I'd recommend.""Boeing (BA), another recent mark, certainly didn't take that road. In fact, according to people familiar with the matter, Boeing executives reached out to transition-team members to tell them the Air Force One price tag Trump had complained about could be lowered — if the government reduced the requirements. The company said CEO Dennis Muilenburg had spoken with Trump and was committed to keeping the project as affordable as possible.That's the kind of outcome, squishy as it is, that Trump can trumpet as a victory. There was a similar result after he hammered United Technologies (UTX) during the campaign for its plan to move some U.S. jobs to Mexico in its Carrier unit. Postelection, Carrier made a deal to keep an Indiana factory open with more than 1,000 employees in exchange for tax incentives provided by the state — whose governor is Vice President-elect Mike Pence — while still sending jobs to Mexico.Some executives profess not to be sweating it all.""We're not big enough to be on that radar screen,"" said Wendy's (WEN) CEO Todd Penegor. Maybe, but Trump has gone small too, even badgering a local union representative in Indiana.Asked if presidential unpredictability will make it harder to run a business, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) CEO Lauren Potdevin said only time will tell. The company generates about 70% of its revenue in the U.S. But as Potdevin took pains to point out, it's based in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a country not ruled from the White House.""Being a Canadian brand is awesome,"" he said. ""Everyone loves Canada.""

403,LMT,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate.

But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review. The FDA will also look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) brigatinib, which fights non-small-cell lung cancer.Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to seek approval for its refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, an early CAR-T treatment. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) aims to change traditional Hodgkin lymphoma therapy when it unveils phase-three data.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Biogen (BIIB) each have data on Alzheimer's treatments due in 2017. Drugs that significantly slow cognitive decline would be huge blockbusters.Some biomed companies may make announcements about drugs or financials at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Seattle Genetics CEO Angles For Hodgkin's Lymphoma EurekaOil stocks have rallied since crude prices bottomed in early 2016, and the industry has reason for cautious optimism. After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

President-elect Donald Trump's Twitter (TWTR) rants on Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) aircraft have slammed defense stocks, but other Pentagon suppliers with lower profiles have continued to rally on expectations of bigger military spending. Stocks To Watch While Boeing shares have recovered…
"
405,LMT,"Boeing (BA) shares rose fractionally on the stock market today, hitting a fresh 21-month high after announcing a weekend deal tol sell Iran Air 80 jets worth $16.6 billion at list price. It's the aerospace giant's first such deal since Iran's Islamic Republic took power in 1979.The deal includes 50 737 MAX 8s, 15 777-300ERs and 15 777-9s, Boeing said on its website Sunday. The actual price is likely less than $16.6 billion, because deals are typically discounted from list prices.Boeing had reached a Memorandum of Agreement with Iran Air announced in June. The U.S. government gave the green light to a deal in September.Boeing's European rival Airbus (EADSY) in January provisionally agreed to sell 118 planes to Iran Air in a deal valued at around $25 billion at list prices. An Airbus-Iran Air deal will be completed within a few days, an Iranian official told Reuters.The deals follow Iran's nuclear deal with the U.S. and other western powers in January. President-elect Donald Trump has harshly criticized that deal and threatened to tear it up.Trump last week went on Twitter (TWTR) to criticize a contract to build new Air Force One presidential jets as too expensive, saying the government should cancel the order.Boeing shares rose 0.4% to 157.16 on Monday, nearly topping the record high set in February 2015. Boeing fell intraday after Trump said the F-35 fighter jet is too costly. Lockheed Martin (LMT) makes the F-35. Trump's comments rocked several defense stocks, though they closed well off session lows.Boeing stressed that the Iran Air will support U.S. manufacturing jobs, something that Trump has stressed as priority before and after the election.""Today's agreement will support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the 777-300ERs and nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs in the U.S. aerospace value stream,"" Boeing said in a statement.On Monday, Boeing said it will cut its 777 widebody production rate from 7 a month to 5 a month, starting next August. That assumes Iran Air sale will go forward, so if the deal is blocked, Boeing may cut 777 output further.Airbus shares rose 1.75% to 15.99 on Monday.

406,LMT,"Hexcel (HXL), a company that makes composites for aerospace giants like Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY), offered a disappointing 2017 financial forecast on Tuesday, ahead of Heico's (HEI) mixed quarterly results after the close.Heico's fiscal Q4 EPS rose 16% to 65 cents, beating the consensus by 3 cents, as sales increased 11% to $363.3 million, missing views for $372.7 million. Heico said its revenue met its own targets. Management sees fiscal 2017 net income rising 7%-10% with sales up 5%-7%.Earlier, Heico said its board increased its regular semiannual cash dividend by 13% to 9 cents.Shares fell 1% in late trading on the stock market today, after retreating 0.7% to 78.91, just above buy range, in the regular session. Hexcel shares dipped 0.1% to 52.14 , after a big postelection ascent. Boeing rose to a record 160.07 early, but ended down 0.3% at 156.66. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus jumped 4% to 16.63, moving into buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Among the biggest influencers of the stock market right now? President-elect Trump's Twitter account. Days after Trump tweeted that the costs of Boeing's Air Force One deal were ""out of control,"" the president-elect on Monday said Lockheed Martin's F-35 program's costs, as well, were ""out of control."" Hexcel expects earnings per share next year of $2.64-$2.76, below analysts' outlook for $2.80, on revenue of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, below views for $2.157 billion.The company said growth in its commercial aerospace segment, its largest, would come largely from the Airbus A350 XWB widebody jets as well as Airbus' narrow-body A320 neo and Boeing's 737 Max. The company's composite materials are used in airframes and are intended to make aircraft lighter and more efficient.Space and defense markets were expected to be ""stable"" next year, the company said. Capital expenditures for 2017 were expected to be $270 million-$290 million.The company said it was targeting double-digit EPS growth and a 6%-9% sales compound annual growth rate through 2020.RELATED:Boeing Hikes Dividend, Buyback Amid Long-Term QuestionsBoeing Sets $16.6 Billion, 80-Jet Iran Air Deal, Still Curbs 777 Production

407,LMT,"Small business owners are more upbeat, with optimism surging after Election Day, according to National Federation of Independent Business data released Tuesday.The NFIB's small business optimism index rose 3.5 points to 98.4, the highest since the cycle peak in December 2014. But that masks the sentiment shift after Donald Trump won the presidential election and Republicans retained control of Congress.""What a difference a day makes,"" said Juanita Duggan, NFIB President and CEO. ""Before Election Day small business owners' optimism was flat, and after Election Day it soared.""A net 15% of companies plan to add staff, up from 10%. But job creation plans shot up from a net 9% through Nov. 8 to 23% after Election Day. A net 20% of small business owners expect higher sales postelection, up from 4% in early November.Most notably, a net 38% expected business conditions to improve after Trump's victory vs. -6% through Nov. 8. That's the highest since November 2004.""If higher optimism can be sustained, I expect that in the coming months we'll see an increase in business activity, such as hiring and expanding,"" said NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 10-year high in December, even with Democrat sentiment falling.Stock markets have rallied as investors see corporate tax reform, regulatory relief and perhaps ObamaCare repeal. Small businesses have even more to cheer.Unlike multinational giants, especially techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) that have vast intellectual property assets, small firms can't sidestep the taxman via complex, global tax-minimization schemes. So lower business tax rates will have a big impact on their after-tax profits.Also, Trump and a GOP Congress could eliminate or slash the estate tax, a huge issue for small business owners.Regulatory relief would have outsized benefits on smaller firms, which lack dedicated staff focused on compliance with complex and costly rules.""Small business owners are clearly encouraged by the election results, but now it's time for President-elect Trump and congressional leaders to deliver,"" said Duggan. ""Federal taxes, regulations, and ObamaCare are the three biggest impediments to running a small business in America.""Trump carries risks for business, but more for corporate titans than Main Street minnows. Small businesses have less to fear from Trump's protectionist instincts than S&P 500 companies that have big exports, imports and overseas operations. And Trump isn't likely to single out a small firm for public criticism.Trump in recent days has blasted Boeing (BA) over Air Force One presidential jet replacement costs and the ""out of control"" F-35 by Lockheed Martin (LMT). He's criticized and later reached a deal with United Technologies (UTX) over Carrier jobs in Indiana heading to Mexico.

408,LMT,"Boeing (BA) said late Monday that it will increase its quarterly dividend by 30% to $1.42 a share and replace its stock repurchase program with a new $14 billion buyback, while key uncertainties linger over the longer term.The aerospace giant enjoys a backlog of more than 5,600 commercial aircraft order as airlines scrambled to recapitalize their fleets in recent years, and Boeing is ramping up production of planes to meet demand, providing a steady source of cash for the company.""As our team delivers on our large and diverse order backlog, and drives greater efficiency across our business, Boeing is well positioned to generate increasing cash flows and meet our commitment to provide competitive returns to our shareholders,"" said Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg in a statement.Shares were up 1.6% at 159.70 in late trading on the stock market today, after closing 0.4% higher in the regular session at 157.16. The after-hours action suggests that Boeing may top its February 2015 peak of 158.83 on Tuesday.But Boeing has seen United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) delay hefty orders this year as carriers look to cut costs or invest money elsewhere. United even said it may add more used jets to its fleet.Cheap fuel costs have allowed airlines to fly older, less efficient models since the oil bust. While OPEC and non-OPEC members just reached a deal to trim production and prop up prices, increased output from U.S. shale companies could keep downward pressure on oil, and doubts remain about the credibility of the deal.Meanwhile, Boeing also said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max, after losing market share to rival Airbus' (EADSY) A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing's Muilenburg assured analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.The incoming Trump administration also represents another source of uncertainty, as he has taken to Twitter (TWTR) to signal displeasure with costs for programs like Boeing's Air Force One replacement and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.And Boeing's $16.6 billion, 80-jet deal with Iran, which was made possible by Tehran's nuclear deal with the U.S. and other western powers in January, is at risk as President-elect Donald Trump has harshly criticized the nuclear agreement and threatened to tear it up.Boeing late Monday also said it would cut its 777 production to five a month from seven, starting next August. That assumes that the Iran deal, which includes 30 777 jets, will go through.Airbus, which has its own pending Iran jet deal that may close soon, rose 1.75% to 15.99 on Monday.

410,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) became the latest company to come under attack by President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the defense giant's F-35 stealth fighter program for having ""out of control"" costs.It came a week after he vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement planes, citing the cost.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Fore, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.In a tweet Monday, Trump was hammered to program for escalating expenses.The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump reiterated his attack on Boeing and said the F-35's cost is ""out of control.""""We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,"" said Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 general manager, on Monday.He added that the company has reduced the price by more than 70% and predicted it will reach $85 million per plane by 2019-2020. In addition to the acquisition cost, Lockheed is also working on reducing the F-35's operating and sustainment costs, he said.Shares of Lockheed fell 2.4% to 253.23 on the stock market today, but rebounding from a low of 245.50 and closing above their 50-day average. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, retreated 2.7%, closing near session highs but just below its 50-day line. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the F-35's engines, reversed earlier losses to edge up 0.6% at 110.40, still in range from a buy point of 109.52 Boeing seesawed between gains and losses and ended 0.4% higher.Last Wednesday, Cowen & Co. warned that while Trump's Air Force One criticism likely won't hurt Boeing much, his habit of using Twitter (TWTR) as a bully pulpit could pose a bigger risk for Lockheed and Northrop.""This is in line with his campaign comment that he wants to boost defense spending but feels DoD could 'buy smarter,' "" Cowen said. ""Presumably he won't comment on all defense contracts but will focus on high profile programs. However, given his power as president, this can have an impact on specific programs.""But even if Trump restricts himself to a ""bombastic Twitter shoutout,"" a tougher stance could still affect defense stocks, Cowen added.Among other defense giants, Raytheon (RTN) was down 1.7% Monday, closing above its 50-day. General Dynamics (GD) fell 0.9%.Trump has already taken on Ford (F) and United Tech's Carrier unit for moving production to Mexico. And on Wednesday, he is due to meet executives from Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA), among other tech leaders, in New York.The tech industry largely supported Hillary Clinton in the election, and Trump has attacked the sector for relying on overseas production.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Get TrumpedApple, Google Set For Trump Tech Summit

414,LMT,"U.S. arms sales overseas could crush records in fiscal year 2017 after the State Department cleared helicopter, missile and other military sales to allies in the Middle East. But President-elect Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric could weigh on future sales to the region.On Thursday the State Department approved a possible sale of 37 Boeing (BA) Apache helicopters to the United Arab Emirates along with engines and other spare parts for an estimated $3.5 billion, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.An estimated $3.51 billion order for 48 Boeing Chinook helicopters, related equipment, training, and support was approved for Saudi Arabia.Other major deals approved included an $108 million deal for TOW anti-tank missiles to Morocco and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney F117 engines and logistic support to Qatar.The approvals totaled $7.9 billion, bringing the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's total notifications to $41.8 billion in less than three months into fiscal year 2017, easily beating the $33.6 billion the agency reported last year. Earlier this year the White House approved sales of Boeing's F-15s and F/A-18 Super Hornets and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-16s to allies in the region.With the fighter and helicopter sales, the figures are on track top a record $46.6 billion in sales set in 2015, but the recent approvals don't mean the sales are done deals yet.Boeing shares rose 0.7% to 156.49 in the stock market today, the highest since February 2015. United Tech climbed 1.25% to 109.79, moving back above a 109.52 buy point.

Cancel order!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016Shortly after that tweet, Trump told reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, ""The plane is totally out of control ... We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.""David Melcher, CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, tried to play down Trump's threat, telling reporters ""what is tweeted today is not necessarily going to be the policy of tomorrow,"" but said today's tweet needs to be addressed by the transition team.He added that his advice to AIA members is to not tweet back.The White House said the figures that Trump cited don't match the arrangement between Boeing and the Pentagon. The Air Force has previously designated $1.65 billion for two new planes. Boeing also responded that it is currently under an initial contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities for Air Force One replacement planes.""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,"" Boeing said.But the Government Accountability Office put the eventual cost at $3.2 billion between fiscal years 2010 and 2020, the AP said, and an Air Force official told NBC News that the price tag is expected to top $4 billion when the planes are delivered.Boeing has reached out to Trump transition officials saying that the cost of the new Air Force One plans could be lowered if the government reduces its stringent requirements, Bloomberg reported late Tuesday, citing sources.Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told Politico that Air Force One is a ""flying White House.""Lee added, ""There's (electronic) countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner.""Boeing shares closed up less than 0.1% at 152.24 on the stock market today after sinking as low as 150.02. On Monday, Boeing hit a 19-month high of 153.75 intraday. U.S.-listed shares of European rival Airbus (EADSY) retreated 1% Tuesday.""While we appreciate the enthusiasm we've seen expressed on social media for Airbus products and their value proposition, it would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate on the future plans and policies of the next administration,"" and Airbus spokesman said.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's defense unit is getting boost from international orders. In September the White House approved sales of its F-15s and F/A-18 Super Hornets to allies in the Middle East and last month Canada said it would buy more Super Hornets to replace its aging fighters.Trump has already used the Twitter (TWTR) bully pulpit aggressively before taking office.He apparently convinced Ford to keep a small SUV production line going at a Kentucky plant. Last week, he used a combination of threats and state tax incentives to get United Technologies' Carrier unit to keep open one Indiana plant, saving close to 1,000 jobs.Boeing is one of the companies most vulnerable to any global backlash to Trump micromanagement and protectionist measures.China has already threatened to shift orders from Boeing to Airbus if Trump enacts anti-China measures. And Trump may go after Boeing and other big defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter is far over budget, while a recent report said the Pentagon is hiding some $125 billion in bureaucratic waste.Lockheed shares fell 0.35% to 266, hovering just below a 267.03 buy point.RELATED: Trump Sold Boeing, Apple, All Other Stocks In JuneBoeing Sees Tax Incentive Remaining Despite WTO RulingTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

429,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) tumbled the most in six months after disclosing that a $4.6 billion spinoff of its information-technology division to Leidos Holdings Inc. would provide less of a boost to earnings than investors expected.Shares of the world's largest defense contractor tumbled 3.5% to 257.21. Lockheed is one of Tuesday's worst performers on the S&P 500 Index.Lockheed repurchased 9.4 million shares through the tax-free transaction, known as a Reverse Morris Trust, the Bethesda, Md.-based company said in a statement Tuesday.That was less than the 10 million that investors had expected Lockheed to retire, meaning the deal will provide less of a lift to its earnings on a per-share basis, said Joseph Denardi, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.The merger, which closed Tuesday, sheds slower-growing IT businesses that face more competition from Silicon Valley and other new market entrants. Leidos paid $1.8 billion in cash and $2.8 billion of its common stock to Lockheed shareholders.

434,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and other defense stocks enjoyed a furious rally last week after the presidential election. Donald Trump had vowed to beef up military spending on the campaign trail, while lower corporate tax rates could also be a boon.Defense shares are holding steady or pulling back modestly in lighter volume. But that could offer new buying opportunities for investors. Keep in mind that new defense spending may not materialize. And if Pentagon spending does increase, that doesn't mean all defense firms, or stocks, will be winners.Lockheed Martin fell 7 cents to 263.28 on the stock market today after falling 1% to 263.35 Wednesday. Lockheed reversed from an all-time intraday high of 269.74 Tuesday.The defense giant, maker of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, closed at 267.24 on Monday, just above a 267.03 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. Such patterns can work, but the odds are less than cup bases with a handle. Handles offer an opportunity to shake out weak holders, so when the stock clears the pivot, big institutions have to bid up prices to get holders to part with their shares.Lockheed could be forming a handle, but that would need a few more days to develop. Until then, the 267.03 entry point holds.L3 Communications (LLL), like Lockheed, raced up to hit a buy point on Monday, though it didn't close above that 154.18 level. L3 fell 0.3% to 149.97 Thursday, its third straight modest decline. Like Lockheed, it could be working on a handle, but it's not ready yet.The maker of military communications and surveillance gear plunged 7.4% on Oct. 27 after its latest earnings report. Shares continued to slide to a low of 132.38 on Nov. 3, below the 200-day line. But L3 raced straight back up, spiking 12% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have been huge winners since the presidential election. They too are pulling back. But bank stock charts still look great.Raytheon fell 0.8% to 144.96, its third straight modest loss. It's still in buy range from a 143.49 entry point.Raytheon broke out on Nov. 9, after the presidential election, hitting a record 152.58 intraday before settling at a 7.5% gain to 146.71.Northrop Grumman dipped 0.3% to 244.66 Thursday after modest losses in the prior two sessions.Northrop broke past a 224.22 buy point on Oct. 27, following its earnings report. Shares then traded in a tight range before exploding following Trump's win, pushing the stock out of buy range. After a stock is more than 5% extended from the pivot, investors should avoid chasing it. But Northrop could pull back into range, which extends up to 235.43.General Dynamics edged down 0.1% to 165.63, its third straight modest decline. It's still slightly extended from buy range.General Dynamics gapped higher on Nov. 9, blasting above a 157.07 pivot from a short consolidation. The chase zone reaches to 164.92, so keep an eye on further pullbacks.Boeing (BA) fell 0.8% to 145.33, moving further into buying range after dipping barely into a proper entry zone on Wednesday. Boeing has a 139.55 buy point in a flat base, in range up to 146.53. Boeing cleared the entry point on Oct. 26 following Q3 earnings.Boeing remains focused mostly on civilian aircraft, but it's still a big Pentagon contractor.Here is a weekly chart:RELATED:Raytheon Launched Into Buy Range On Trump Win, Defense Stocks RallyLockheed, Northrop Price Targets HikedTrump Wants To Beef Up Military, But Funding Could Be The Enemy

438,LMT,"Defense contractors and investors are celebrating Donald Trump's plan to boost weapons spending, but Pentagon budgeting experts say he's counting on savings that won't come true -- the old Washington saw of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.""It's a fantasy,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the president-elect's campaign pledge to finance a more robust military partly by slashing bureaucracy and duplication at the Pentagon. Eaglen has briefed Trump's advisers.""I tried several times to disabuse them of the notion that this could ever pay for even a fraction of Trump's buildup costs,"" she said.As a candidate, Trump called for defense initiatives that analysts such as Eaglen say would add $55 billion to $80 billion annually to a spending request that totals $583 billion this year. Trump envisions a Navy with dozens more ships than the service has sought and an Army as big as the one President George W. Bush sent into Iraq and Afghanistan for full-scale invasions.Encouraged by those prospects, the S&P Aerospace & Defense index climbed 3.9% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader S&P 500, to the highest level since 1989. It was led by Raytheon (RTN), L-3 Communications Holdings (LLL), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). The index climbed an additional 2% Thursday.Fulfilling campaign promises is only part of the defense spending challenge facing the new president.There's an immediate issue: delivering on Trump's pledge to remove caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act that would constrain Pentagon spending over the next four years. President Barack Obama, backed by Democratic lawmakers, has resisted eliminating the defense caps unless those on domestic spending are eased as well.Howard Rubel, a defense analyst with Jefferies Inc., said in a note that ""the election appears to embolden fiscal conservatives and military hawks. The prospects for eliminating"" the caps ""jumps substantially. The problem is that domestic safety net-type spending may suffer"" and ""addressing the deficit may be an afterthought.""The caps, which have been temporarily modified three times, are due to return in fiscal 2018, the first budget of the new administration. Through 2021, the caps would force about $106.6 billion in Pentagon cuts if no agreement is reached and the automatic cuts known as sequestration kick in, including about $33 billion in fiscal 2018.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is Trump's top defense adviser and is said to be a leading candidate for defense secretary, told Defense News last month that ""it is painful for me as a budget"" hawk ""to acknowledge that we can't stay at a sequester-like level. We are just not going to be able to do that.""Trump also faces pending weapons decisions such as whether to increase purchases of Lockheed's F-35, the Pentagon's costliest weapons system, to 70 in the fiscal 2018 budget from the 63 requested this year.And then there are long-term funding questions that require advanced planning, including how to cope with what the military calls a ""bow wave"" of spending after 2021. That includes the planned modernization of all three legs of the air-land-sea triad of nuclear arms, which Trump has endorsed.Trump's broad aspirations are clear. In April he said his ""administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.""Among his promises were to increase the Army to 540,000 soldiers from about 475,000 today, reversing Obama's downsizing that would reduce the force to 450,000 in the next fiscal year. Trump also has vowed to ""build a Navy approaching 350 surface ships and submarines,"" up from about 272 today and the service's goal of 308 ships.For now, at least, the familiar -- and elusive -- Washington refrain of cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse,"" as President Ronald Reagan put it in the 1980s, remains the centerpiece of Trump's financing plan.His campaign website site used a variation on the Reagan theme, saying he would ""pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.""Eaglen, who has worked for Republican lawmakers and served in the Pentagon under Bush, said those are goals that should always be pursued but ""cannot yield $55 to $60 billion per year in new money to reinvest -- period.""""Some of Trump's ideas for a larger Navy, etc. will take a lot more money up front than any reform agenda"" can generate, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. ""Unambiguously, what he wants to do will take more money,"" said O'Hanlon, author of ""The $650 Billion Bargain: The Case For Modest Growth in America's Defense Budget.""Other passages in the Trump campaign statement ""seem to indicate he would raise revenues or cut other parts of government to pay for defense,"" Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an e-mail. ""That is much more realistic, but the devil is in the details and no details are provided.""But ""the idea that auditing the Pentagon is going to uncover billions of dollars of waste is a myth,"" he said.Dov Zakheim, who was Pentagon comptroller under Bush, said that while an audit ""will not save money per se,"" it can focus attention on needless bureaucracy.""Some 70,000 positions have been added since 1990,"" Zakheim said. ""Has DoD become more efficient as a result? I don't think so.""

439,LMT,"Raytheon (RTN) shares soared into buy range Wednesday as defense contractors took flight on the wings of Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election but sales to foreign countries could take a hit.On the campaign trail, Trump said he would boost military spending to make sure older equipment is replaced, increase the number of troops in the military and called for removing the sequester, but he hasn't gone into detail on how he will accomplish his goal.Raytheon shares jumped 7.5% to 146.71 on the stock market today, surpassing its buy point of 143.49.Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares climbed 5.4% to 242.30, propelled out of buy range.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares soared 6% to 253.46, consolidating in a flat base with a buy point of 267.03.During the campaign, Trump declared the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete and told allies that America wouldn't foot the bill for their defense any longer, sending shares of U.K.'s BAE Systems higher on the London exchange. He also promised to take an ""America first"" attitude, implicating isolationist policies could weaken arms sales to allies.""We might see a lot of European or Asian partners procuring from other sources,"" said Richard Pettibone, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International.IBD'S TAKE: While Raytheon has moved into buy range with the election of Trump, it's only the 15th-ranked stock in IBD's Aerospace/Defense Group. Atop the list is Heico (HEIA), which makes jet engine parts. Partners will stay put on Lockheed's F-35 program but Lockheed's F-16 could lose its front-runner status as India looks to buy more jets. Lockheed offered attractive incentives to New Delhi, like tech transfers and in August the company said it would move its F-16 manufacturing to India.""But with an isolationist policy, you're not going to give them more tech transfers,"" Pettibone said.Instead India could order more jets from France's Dassault, Sweden's Saab or offerings from Russian firms.RELATED: Despite Closer Russia Ties, Turkey Orders More F-35s; China Debuts J-20Pentagon Finalizes $6 Billion Lockheed Contract For 57 F-35s

441,LMT,"Turkey will order another batch of Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s, according to its defense minister, while China publicly unveiled its J-20 stealth fighter, which may have benefited from a Chinese hack of U.S. defense programs.Turkey will buy 24 more of the advanced F-35 stealth fighters, the country's defense chief, Fikri Isik, said in an interview with broadcaster A Haber on Tuesday. The first batch of F-35As will be delivered to Ankara in 2018, with the second order to be delivered between 2012 and 2022.While Turkey's moves to improve its relations with Russia have worried Western officials, the NATO ally has had plans order 100 F-35s and has approved funding for 30 so far. The deal also comes despite the attempted coup in Turkey earlier this year.Turkey is one of the eight international partners on the F-35, and Turkish Aerospace Industries will build some of the fuselages.

442,LMT,"The Defense Department has finalized a $6.1 billion contract with Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the ninth batch of F-35 stealth fighters, according to a Pentagon statement Wednesday.But Lockheed called it a ""unilateral contract action"" that wasn't mutually agreed upon, saying it was ""disappointed"" with the government's decision.The Pentagon previously had insisted the ninth and 10th batches be negotiated together under one $14 billion pact. Lockheed had already gone ahead and started producing the aircraft to stay on schedule, paying out of pocket for months while contracts were negotiated.But the Wall Street Journal reported last month that the Pentagon may award a contract for just lot 9, as talks over pricing dragged on well past expectations.The price tag for the ninth batch, which includes 57 planes, represents a 3.7% weighted average reduction from the eighth low-rate initial production contract signed in December 2014 and a 58% cut since the first such contract, DOD said Wednesday.The $6 billion doesn't include the engines. A separate contract for those was agreed upon with United Technologies (UTX) in April.The first lot 9 fighters will start delivery in Q1 of 2017. So far, 196 F-35s, including test aircraft, have been delivered.Earlier Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the Pentagon said it will need up to $500 million more to finish the $55 billion development phase of the F-35.The program's simultaneous development and production strategy has come under heavy criticism. Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's director of operational testing, has recommended the ""program be restructured now"" to ""deliver its long-planned and sorely needed"" full war-fighting capability, the Bloomberg report said.In August, Gilmore said in a memo that the F-35 is on ""a path toward failing to deliver"" as he said the program ""is running out of time and money.""The Air Force declared the jet was combat-ready on Aug. 2 and the Marines did the same last year. But the fighter won't have its full war-fighting complement — including the ability to fire its 25-millimeter Gatling gun — until a software upgrade next year.Lockheed shares edged up 0.1% to 245.25 in the stock market today. Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC), a subcontractor on the plane, rose 0.1% to 228.66.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop is in buy range after the defense contractor raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance on strong third-quarter results. RELATED: Despite Closer Russia Ties, Turkey Orders More F-35s; China Debuts J-20Lockheed Soars On Outlook, Payout; Next F-35 Contract Seen Split

Sales at its aerospace systems business climbed 9.4% to $2.78 billion on higher volume of its F-35 and E-2D Hawkeye programs. But results were partially offset by fewer F/A-18 deliveries. Northrop is a major subcontractor on the aircraft programs. Mission system segment sales fell 0.9%.Outlook: The company raised its full-year EPS to $11.55-11.75 from an earlier outlook of $10.75-$11.00. It sees full-year sales of $23.9 billion-$24.1 billion, up from $23.5 billion-$24 billion.

448,LMT,"Boeing's (BA) Q3 earnings are seen rising, but the aerospace giant could take a hit from slumping 777 sales and problems with its military tanker.Analysts expect earnings to rise 3.2% to $2.60 per share but revenue is seen falling 8.6% to $23.64 billion.Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries as deliveries of its 737 fell to 120 from 126, 787 deliveries fell to 36 from 37 a year ago, and 777 deliveries were flat at 22. But defense deliveries rose 4.2% during the quarter.Analysts will be looking to see if Boeing cuts production of its current-generation 777 line. The company has already announced that it is cutting production of the widebody jet to 7 per month in 2017, down from 8.3 per month currently. But that pace is threatened by slowing sales as carriers instead look to the next-generation 777X model.Earlier this month, Qatar Airways ordered 10 777s as part of a larger deal that could total 100 airplanes, mostly 737s and 787s. But executives said it's still too early to tell if the  777s that the Mideast carrier ordered will be enough to keep production levels for the widebody jet steady.Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel said in an note dated Oct. 6 that Boeing could get 777 orders from carriers like Swiss Air, Saudi Arabia's Saudia and Chinese airlines.Boeing might also provide an update on the sale of commercial jets to Iran. Last month, Boeing received a license from the Treasury Department to sell planes to the Islamic republic for the first time since its 1979 revolution. In June, Boeing and Iran reached a tentative deal for more than 100 commercial planes.Despite new orders, Boeing has cut nearly 4,000 jobs in its commercial division so far this year as it loses market share to European rival Airbus (EADSY). More cuts could be on the table as Boeing gave 180 employees advanced layoff notice last week.To counter Airbus' dominance with its A321neo in the space, Boeing is considering lengthening its current 737 Max 9, the largest plane in the 737 family with 180 seats, or redesigning it with larger engines, according to reports last month.IBD'S TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. On the defense side, Boeing could address its KC-46 Air Force tanker program, which has been beset with delays and extra costs. The company took a $393 million after-tax charge on the plane in Q2, due to higher costs to work on technical issues that put the plane behind schedule.Boeing also reported a charge on the tanker in Q1 and has racked up $1.5 billion in cost overruns on additional engineering and development work. Still, the tanker cleared a key milestone in August, allowing low-rate initial production to begin.Last month, the White House approved sales of up to 72 Boeing F-15s for Qatar, 32 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait, and 19 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-16s to Bahrain after a massive aid package for Israel was approved.Airbus is slated to report quarterly results Wednesday. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney's parent company, United Technologies (UTX), will report results Tuesday as will defense giant Lockheed.Boeing shares rose 1.3% to close at 137.45 on the stock market today.

450,LMT,"The new F-35 fighter jet from Lockheed-Martin (LMT) has deserved a ton of press lately. It recently got a thumbs up from the U.S. Air Force saying that its version of the plane is combat-ready. The jet is a high-tech marvel. Among many things, it can hover in midair and fly backward. Shares of Lockheed-Martin have also been going sharply in reverse…
"
451,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

But the memo puts these timelines in doubt as issues with software and other systems continue.The program ""is running out of time and money to complete the planned flight testing and implement the required fixes and modifications,"" the memo said according to the Bloomberg report.

Shares are still above a 245.47 buy point from a base-on-base pattern cleared at the end of June, but Tuesday's heavy-volume slide through the 50-day line raises concerns.The defense contractor closed its $4.6 billion deal to sell its IT business to Leidos (LDOS), making Leidos the largest IT provider for the federal government. The deal was announced in January, but the companies faced regulatory issues.Leidos shares dipped 0.7% to 40.08 Tuesday.However, Lockheed has been making gains in its aerospace and missile sectors.Earlier this month, the Air Force declared its version of Lockheed's F-35 fighter ready for combat. The service eventually plans to procure 1,763 F-35As. In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and was set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.Lockheed and rivals Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Boeing (BA) are among potential contractors for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile system to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman missiles.Northrop shares were down 1.7% to 214.50.

The bomber deal is estimated to be worth $50 billion-$80 billion.Boeing hasn't fared as well as its peers in the aerospace and defense sector, as slowing demand for commercial planes has weighed on the stock.But Boeing is busy on the defense side, not just with the missile deal, but also by submitting a bid for the Air Force's new $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer program to replace the Air Force's 500 Northrop T-38 jets. Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) are also submitting bids.Boeing is also eyeing rotor contracts as the Army looks to replace its Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook, and Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters.Boeing shares fell 0.6% to 134.14 Tuesday, well off their February 2015 peak but modestly above the 50-day and 200-day lines.Raytheon broke out of a flat base in April and has been trading above its buy range since late July.

463,LMT,"The Air Force is expected to declare its version of the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 ready for combat on Tuesday.According to reports, officials will likely declare initial operating capability (IOC) for the F-35A variant on Tuesday, in the early end of the timeframe widow of Aug.1 to the end of the year.Last week, Air Force officials said that Hill Air Force Base's 34th Fighter Squadron had reached all the required milestones before the F-35A can be cleared for combat.Lockheed shares rose 0.8% to 254.84 in the stock market today, still in buy range from a 245.47 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results. See how Lockheed's shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.The F-35 has had a bumpy ride ahead of its IOC. Issues throughout development have included an ejection system that could break the necks of lightweight pilots while ejecting, getting engine data incorporated into the plane's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), and issues with how the software in the F-35's sensors works with the main computer.But Air Force officials said at the Farnborough Airshow last month that there were no technical issues that would delay the F-35A from receiving its initial operational capability status in the current scheduled time.The F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines in July 2015 and is set for deployment to Japan in 2017.

464,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Navy plans to ""continue to modernize"" Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets, said Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, the commander of Naval Air Forces, calling newer versions ""4.5-generation"" fighters.During a talk Thursday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Shoemaker said he isn't minimizing the need for Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, a fifth-generation fighter. Instead, he sees a role for both of them.""We absolutely need the F-35 as soon as we can get it,"" he said. "" We want to pair those two up together.""Shoemaker said the two jets could be flown in tandem to take advantage of the planes' ""very good complement of high-low mix.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 135 in the stock market today. Lockheed shares fell 0.1% to 255.42. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 contractor, was down 0.2% to 218.14IBD'S TAKE:  Boeing's stock isn't as strong as other defense players as its commercial sales struggle. Compare Boeing to others in the Aerospace/Defense group on Stock Checkup.  It's unclear how many more Super Hornets the Pentagon will buy. Without additional orders, Boeing faces the end of its production run. Currently, the Navy has money in its budget for two Super Hornets in 2017 and 14 in 2018.But the service could purchase even more Super Hornets as part of its unfunded spending request, and Congress seems keen to keep the production line open. Boeing has said it needs 24 orders per year to keep the production line alive past 2020.A deal between Boeing and Kuwait for 28 Super Hornets, with an option for 12 more, is facing political roadblocks, so Kuwait recently ordered Eurofighter Typhoons instead.Meanwhile, Shoemaker said that, despite some setbacks with the F-35's development, the Navy has plans to declare the new fighter ready for combat in late 2018. The Navy still needs the new 3F software update on the plane, however.The Air Force declared initial operational capability for its version of the F-35 earlier this month, and the Marine Corps declared its version combat-ready last year.RELATED: Nuclear Missile Cost May Strain Air Force As F-35, B-21 Ramp UpBoeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'.

The action indicated a continued shift in stock sector strategy among institutional players as interest rates look set to rise a little more by the end of the year.Gold mining, metal ore and coal shares rebounded some. In the government bond markets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held firm at 1.765%, virtually flat vs. Monday, according to real-time data provided by Tradeweb. That's up from a low of 1.37% seen in early July.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 sank 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrials eased 0.3%. Small caps got hurt more as the Russell 2000 dropped more than 0.8%. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 1%.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) gapped down more than 10% to 247.59 as volume ballooned to nearly 6 million shares, easily the heaviest turnover so far this year. The paint giant posted a 7% rise in earnings per share to $4.23 a share, the smallest increase in 11 quarters and missing the Thomson Reuters consensus view of $4.32.In March, Sherwin announced a $13 billion all-cash deal to buy rival Valspar (VAL).Sherwin shares have struggled since its July breakout past a 309.10 buy point failed to make much headway. On July 21, shares, gapped down hard on second-quarter results, falling more than 7% from the proper entry and triggering a sell signal. The stock also undercut the 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness.Air conditioning, wood product and building product companies also led the market's downside. Ship transport, apparel manufacturing, restaurant, medical research equipment and medical software stocks also sold off.On the upside, defense stocks rallied on the back of positive results from fighter jet and battle systems supplier Lockheed Martin (LMT). Shares bolted more than 7% to 249.26 and crossed back above the key 50-day moving average in turnover that expanded 33% above average.Lockheed reported a remarkable 30% rise in Q3 profit $3.61 a share, thumping Wall Street's consensus forecast of $2.88, as sales increased 15%, marking the third quarter in a row of double-digit top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2015, earnings were flat. After-tax margin improved to 9.4%, up 190 basis points vs. a year ago.Lockheed is now trading just 6% below a 266.93 all-time high, increasing the possibility for a new base to form.Industry peer Raytheon (RTN) rose more than 2% to 139.75, hopping back its 50-day line. The missile maker is slated to report Q3 results on Thursday. The Street sees earnings up 12% to $1.66 a share, following profit gains in two of the three prior quarters.Boeing (BA) rallied more than 1% to 139.02 in volume surging 65% above typical levels and reached its highest price level since July 27. That gain placed the Dow 30 component within arm's reach of a potential breakout from a 139.55 early buy point.Boeing has been forming a first-stage base since late February of 2015. As seen on its IBD chart, the relative strength line (painted in blue) has climbed sharply in recent weeks, meaning that it's outpacing the S&P 500.

The stock is within buy range, less than 4% above a 147.26 shallow saucer entry point. The saucer could also be interpreted as the long handle of a gigantic saucer base. In either case, the buy point remains the same.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) gained 0.5% to 118.25 in the regular session but fell nearly 3% to around 114.75 in after-hours trade following mixed fiscal Q4 results. Earnings barely edged Wall Street views by 2 cents but still fell nearly 15% to $1.67 a share as revenue of $46.9 billion practically met the consensus forecast and slipped 9%.The results marked a third quarter in a row of slumping profits. However, CEO Tim Cook noted in a news release that Apple's service business revenue saw a 24% jump to an all-time record.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that the company returned $9.3 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly cash payout of 57 cents a share, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record on Nov. 7. The quarterly payout was unchanged, leaving the annualized yield as of Tuesday's closing price at 1.9% vs. 2.09% for the S&P 500 as of Monday's closing price.Apple has recently triggered a second buy point at 116.28, 10 cents above a recent new handle on a long cup pattern. The new handle began forming on Sept. 19. On Sept. 14, Apple staged a fresh breakout from a bottoming-style base with a strong gain past 110.33.RELATED:Lockheed Martin Soars On Bullish OutlookWhen Did Apple Break Out?Why Are Many Stocks Forming Bottoming Base Patterns These Days?Apple Delivers Mixed Fourth Quarter, But Guides Q1 Sales Higher

466,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) third-quarter results topped Wall Street views and the company raised its full-year outlook, while the next two production batches of the F-35 could be split into separate contracts.Estimates: Q3 EPS up 3.6% to $2.87; revenue virtually flat at $11.45 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of $3.61 on revenue of $11.55 billion. Revenue at the aeronautics unit climbed 6.8% to $4.19 billion on higher F-35 sales, and mission systems revenue jumped 55% on the $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year.Outlook: Full-year sales of $46.5 billion, vs. consensus for $46.36 billion, up from its July outlook of $45 billion-$46.2 billion and sees full year EPS of $12.10, above consensus of $11.77, up from its prior outlook of $11.15-$11.45. Lockheed sees 2017 sales up 7% vs. 2016, better than consensus of 2.8%.F-35: Lockheed's upbeat outlook rests on getting contracts for the next two batches of F-35 production, known as lots 9 and 10, and has been paying out of pocket for months while contracts are negotiated with the Pentagon to keep up the production schedule.To help cut costs, the Pentagon has been adamant that lots 9 and 10 should be negotiated together under one $14 billion contract that includes 140 jets. But the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Pentagon may award a contract for just lot 9, which includes more than 63 planes, as talks over pricing have dragged on well past expectations.Stock: Shares jumped 7.4% to finish at 249.26 on the stock market today, gapping above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, as Lockheed also raised its dividend 10% to $1.82 and added $3 billion to its share buyback program.IBD'S TAKE: While Lockheed tries to secure funding at home for the F-35, its F-16 is likely the top choice for India's next fighter jet competition.Aerospace giant Boeing (BA) will announce quarterly earnings results Wednesday along with Airbus (EADSY) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).

468,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) lost the first round of India's fighter jet competition to France's Dassault, but its F-16 is likely in India's cross hairs as New Delhi starts another acquisition program.India is looking to buy single-engine fighters to replace some of its roughly 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft nearing the end of their service lives. The single-engine jets will replace Russian MiG 21 and MiG 27 aircraft.""Some overseas participants"" were invited to participle in the program, according to a Ministry of Defense official cited by Defense News Wednesday.Saab's Gripen E is also expected to be in the running too, along with a Russian offering.Lockheed Martin shares closed up 0.4% at 232.99 on the stock market today. The stock has fallen sharply since peaking on Aug. 15, with Lockheed undercutting its 200-day line last week.Last month, India signed a deal worth nearly $9 billion for 36 Rafale fighter jets, rather than picking Boeing's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, Lockheed's F-16 or BAE's Eurofighter.Analysts predicted that India would launch another acquisition, likely within the year, because the deal was too small to make a dent in India's replacement needs.Lockheed has offered attractive incentives to New Delhi. In August, Lockheed said it would move its F-16 manufacturing to India. During U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter's visit to India in April, he reportedly pushed for a Boeing (BA) or Lockheed buy.Boeing shares edged up 0.2% Thursday.RELATED: Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop To Chase $90 Billion In Missile DealsBoeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid Deal

Raytheon ended down less than 0.1% at 137.28.IBD'S TAKE: The Pentagon is also investing in updating its aging intercontinental ballistic missile and Long-Range Standoff nuclear missile with Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman all chasing the lucrative contracts.On Saturday, a North Korean mid-range missile exploded almost immediately after lifting off. While a temporary setback, the regime has been able to advance its missile technology despite international sanctions and is expected to conduct another missile test soon.In July, South Korea and Washington agreed to deploy the THAAD system by late 2017 as Pyongyang becomes increasingly aggressive. So far, North Korea has tested at least 21 ballistic missiles and staged two nuclear tests this year.Meanwhile, Germany might be having second thoughts over its own missile defense system, according to a Reuters report, as the cost for the Medium Extended Air Defense System system would reach $9 billion to $10 billion, billions of dollars over the original $4.5 billion estimate.The proposal submitted by MBDA -- a joint venture of Airbus (EADSY), BAE Systems and Leonardo Finmeccanica -- and Lockheed beat out Raytheon's Patriot system for the contract from Berlin last year.But a source told Reuters that some German officials broached the possibility of reconsidering a deal with Raytheon.U.S.-listed shares of Airbus added less than 0.1% to 14.47.RELATED: Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing Aren't Done Fighting For Air SupremacyNorthrop, Raytheon, L3 Seen Leading Defense Stocks As Budgets Rise

470,LMT,"Airbus (EADSY)  Chief Executive Tom Enders vowed to ""seek remedies"" from Poland, saying the European aerospace giant had ""been misled for months"" on a helicopter deal that Warsaw scrapped last week in favor of one with Lockheed Martin (LMT).Lockheed, which had lost to Airbus in the initial bidding, will produce two Black Hawk helicopters in Poland this year for the country's military and then eight more in 2017. Eleven more helicopters could be purchased in 2018, according to Bloomberg.Polish officials also said that Italy's Leonardo-Finmeccanica will get orders for its AW149 helicopters.Airbus had planned to supply 50 H225M Caracal multirole helicopters, valued at $3.5 billion, to Poland.

471,LMT,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%. Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%. Analysts expected Apple to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $46.94 billion. For the holiday quarter, Apple guided Wall Street higher on revenue, but its profit margin outlook came up short. Apple also unveiled new MacBook Pro notebook computers, which feature a touch-screen strip for application commands and shortcuts that replaces the function keys. Apple fell 2.5% for the week, but remains above its 50-day line.Amazon reported Q3 earnings of 52 cents a share, a big gain but well short of estimates for 78 cents. The e-commerce giant plowed money into its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a big expansion of fulfillment centers heading into the holiday season. Revenue rose 29% to $32.7 billion, meeting views. AWS was among the bright spots in the earnings report as revenue rose 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, beating the consensus. Q4 revenue guidance also lagged. Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger. Tesla is in the process of buying SolarCity. Elon Musk is the top shareholder in both companies, as well as SpaceX.Tesla found resistance at the 50-day line and reversed, ending the week down 12 cents at 199.97. SolarCity climbed 2.7%.Gigamon (GIMO) reported third quarter profit and revenue that blew past estimates and raised current quarter guidance. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion. Mobile-communications chipmaker Qualcomm said the acquisition will expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. The Qualcomm-NXP transaction marks the biggest semiconductor deal ever, surpassing Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom (AVGO).New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) met fiscal Q1 EPS views with a 15% gain to 90 cents. Revenue climbed 16.5%, above analysts' expectations, as enrollment boomed. The IBD 50 stock sees Q2 revenue above analyst guidance. Fellow Chinese for-profit school stock TAL Education (XRS) Q2 results topped estimates as total student enrollment jumped 77%. It guided Q3 revenue above Wall Street views.

Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 5%, Celgene (CELG) 7% and Alexion (ALXN) 9% after beating on earnings. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday beat, but shares tumbled nearly 10% Friday amid concerns about key drug Enbrel going forward. Also Friday, Novo Nordisk (NVO) dived 13% and Sanofi (SNY) rose 4.3%, as the European drugmakers had different views on the outlook for insulin treatments.Meanwhile, drug distributor McKesson (MCK) crashed 22.7% Friday after a big miss, blaming rival AmerisourceBergen (ABC) for heavy competition and further pressure from political attention on drug prices.

472,LMT,"Germany said Tuesday it will buy four to six Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J transport planes but still plans to plans to follow through with its full purchase of Airbus' (EADSY) delayed A400.The decision comes after Airbus booked a $1.12 billion charge on its military transport in July over delays caused by an engine component issue, and the European aerospace giant warned that it could take more charges.German officials said that even with the Lockheed deal, they would still buy 53 Airbus A400Ms.Lockheed shares fell 1.45% to finish at 237.10 in the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus rose 1% to 15.14.IBD'S TAKE: Delays have hit Airbus' commercial division as well as, while Boeing will likely win a ""large"" purchase from Qatar Airways, which has expressed frustration with Airbus. Earlier this year, France agreed to buy the C-130, which is also used by the U.S. and other allies.RELATED: Boeing, Lockheed Still In The Hunt For Fighter Sales To India Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid Deal

473,LMT,"Stocks got off to a rosy start for the week on Monday, led by large-cap tech and internet names. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, remained in buy range after clearing a second handle buy point at 116.38 within its long first-stage cup base pattern.The Nasdaq composite rose 1% while the Nasdaq 100 gained more than 1.1%. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrials more than 0.4%, trailing the Russell 2000's nearly 0.7% lift. Volume fell on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Top industry groups in the stock market today included fiber optic gear, wireless telecom service, chipmaking and fabless semiconductor stocks. A sharp drop in gold mining and various oil-related shares hurt the S&P 500 and the Dow more than the Nasdaq.Lumentum (LITE), a leading name in IBD's fiber optic industry group, rose more than 2% to 41.40 in dull trading. The maker of optical data networking components and lasers is set to report third-quarter results on Thursday. Wall Street sees earnings rising 76% to 44 cents a share.Lumentum's earnings dropped 14% in the year-ago period, then jumped 29%, 191% and 156% in the three most recent quarters. Lumentum has held above its 50-day moving average all throughout its run since breaking out past a 27.49 buy point in a cup with deep handle on July 20. (The accompanying chart shows Lumentum's solid move on a weekly chart, with the 10-week moving average painted in red.)In the restaurant sector, Burger King chain and Tim Hortons coffee and doughnut chain operator Restaurant Brands International (QSR) raced to a six-week high of 47.49 but then reversed badly, falling 5% to 44.67. Volume ballooned more than four times its normal level and the stock sank below its 50-day line.On Monday, the Ontario, Canada-based company reported a nearly 35% jump in third-quarter adjusted profit to 43 cents a share. That marked the sixth quarter in a row of solid earnings. Systemwide sales rose 4.8% at Tim Hortons and 7% at Burger King in constant currencies. Same-store sales rose mildly, up 2% and 1.7%, respectively.QSR had recently cracked above longtime resistance at the 45 price level with a high-volume breakout on July 20 past a 44.12 entry. Now, watch to see if the stock can find support at the former resistance level.Back to Apple, the mega-cap tech rose 0.9% to 117.65, meaning it's extended past a 110.33 buy point in a long cup with handle pattern. The pattern began to really take shape after the iPhone maker gapped up and tested upside resistance at its 200-day moving average on July 27, one day after it reported results for the June-ended fiscal third quarter.Six weeks later, Apple sold off but held above its now-rising 50-day moving average — a clear sign that the tables were turning for the largest company in the U.S. markets by market cap. That bullish action set up a breakout past the 110.23 intraday high in a handle that formed from Aug. 16 to Sept. 13. A day later on Sept. 14, Apple rallied more than 3% and cleared the 110.33 buy point. The cup with handle became a bottoming base.More recently, shares made another constructive pullback and the stock formed a second handle that featured the 116.38 buy point — 10 cents above the handle's high of 116.28. Keep in mind that's a risky alternative entry for the stock.The 5% buy zone from the new 116.38 buy point extends to 122.20.On Sept. 2, Apple's 50-day moving average crossed back above its slower-moving 200-day line, a positive sign.Apple is slated to report after the close Tuesday; earnings are seen falling 16% to $1.65 a share after jumping sharply in the year-ago quarter, up 38%.Wall Street sees revenue falling 9% to $46.9 billion. The most bullish estimate among 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is $48.3 billion, which would still be down 6.2% vs. the $51.5 billion Apple posted in the year-ago quarter.Also on Tuesday, expect quarterly reports from Under Armour (UA) (before the market open), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE). All four firms will report before Tuesday's market open. Under Armour is expected to deliver a 108% increase in earnings to 25 cents a share and a 21% rise in sales to $1.46 billion.Under Armour still lies 28% below its all-time-week peak of 52.95 and currently gets a lowly 34 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. The stock's 16 Relative Price Strength Rating is virtually no better than rival Nike (NKE), which is also lagging the market over the past 12 months with a 13 RS rating.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to almost 1.77%.

474,LMT,"The cost to develop new intercontinental ballistic missiles could be higher than what the Air Force has estimated, adding pressure to the service's already strained budget outlook just as spending on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber is about to ramp up.Last year, the Air Force estimated that the replacement for Boeing's (BA) Minuteman III would cost $62.3 billion for 400 missiles and related infrastructure. But a separate estimate from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment found that number is likely too low by ""billions of dollars,"" sources told Bloomberg.Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are all vying for the new ICBM program.Boeing shares fell 0.2% in the stock market today. Lockheed sank 0.4%, and Northrop rose 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results last month. See how Minuteman III maker Boeing's shares stack up against other stronger players in the group on Stock Checkup.  The cost discrepancy comes as the Air Force looks to expand production rates on the F-35 in the coming years and continues developing the B-21. In addition to those programs, the Air Force is also looking at a new Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles and is buying new aerial refueling tankers. Last week, the Pentagon OK'd a contract for Boeing to produce the first 19 KC-46 tankers in a deal worth $2.8 billion.The outlays for the Air Force programs are expected to create what analysts have called a ""bow wave"" of costs expected to slam the budget around 2021. To deal with it, a study early this year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the Pentagon will require a bigger budget or must delay several strategic programs.But the Navy, for example, won't see a similar bow wave, as its Ohio-class submarine replacement program ramps up while several of aircraft programs wind down over the next 10 years.

475,LMT,"Selling intensified in the last hour of trading in the stock market today, as the major indexes suffered their biggest decline in heavier trade in several weeks.The Nasdaq composite lost almost 0.7%, slightly more than the S&P 500's nearly 0.6% drop. The Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.5%. Volume sped up on both exchanges, according to preliminary data, signifying intense selling among the professional crowd.Helping to spark the selling were comments from Federal Reserve official and New York Federal Reserve chief William Dudley during an interview with Fox Business that ""it's possible"" for the U.S. central bank to consider more seriously a new bump up in short-term interest rates when he and other members meet Sept 20-21.Meanwhile, crude oil prices jumped sharply, with WTI near-term futures rising almost 2% to $46.58 a barrel. Reports noted Saudi Arabia's oil minister commenting that his country is ready to stabilize energy markets, hinting at a possible restriction of output. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell.A wide swath of stocks, even market leaders, fell en masse, including top guns Lockheed Martin (LMT) on the big-cap side to smaller names such as discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) (off 2%) and home security play Alarm.com (ALRM) (down 9%).Lockheed, maker of the new F-35 fighter jet, fell 3.7% to 256.77 in heavy volume. While the stock is still above its fast-rising 50-day moving average, Lockheed suffered its biggest single-day point loss since the stock broke out in late April, clearing a 228.01 flat-base buy point.As seen on its daily chart, Lockheed remains comfortably above its 50-day line near 250 as well as its long-term 200-day moving average near 228.Meanwhile, Five Below closed just a hair below its 50-day moving average; volume picked up, rising 54% above average.One stock, however, refused to bend lower. Tarena International (TEDU), which specializes in software and tech education to Chinese students, rallied 1.8% to 11.80. The small-cap ($656 million market value) play sports a 97 Composite Rating from IBD. The stock is trying to clear an 11.71 entry point within a long, somewhat sloppy base. Tarena reported strong Q2 results as profit rose 86% to 13 cents a share on a 35% lift in revenue to $56 million.IBD'S TAKE: Does Tuesday's broad decline in heavier trade signify a change in market trend?

478,LMT,"On Tuesday, the Air Force approved its version of the fighter for combat, after the first 12 F-35As met mission requirements, such as combat air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, and other operations in a contested environment. The Air Force eventually plans to procure 1,763 F-35As.
"
479,LMT,"For now, the service's F-35A squadron will fly out of Hill Air Force Base in Utah. But if commanders in the field request it, the F-35A will deploy overseas, Gen. Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, told reporters at the Pentagon. He added that the F-35 will likely see action sooner than the F-22 did. Lockheed's F-22 was declared ready for combat in 2005 but didn't engage in combat until 2014 when it struck ISIS targets in Syria. Earlier opportunities to deploy the F-22 were seen as too provocative, but Carlisle said sending the F-35 to the Middle East or Europe today would ""reassure friends and is a deterrent to adversaries.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.85% on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35 program, gained 0.9%. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the engines for the fighter, dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results. See how Lockheed's shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.  In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and is set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.Although the F-35A has now reached initial operational capability (IOC), it must wait until next year to have full war-fighting capabilities as part of its 3F software upgrade, which will enable the F-35 to fire its 25 mm Gatling gun, among other things.And the fighter won't reach full operational capability until the 2021-2022 time frame, when two fighter wings of about 72 aircraft each will be ready for deployment with the latest software and updates to the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), considered the ""brains"" of the aircraft.Meanwhile, its close-air-support features are still only at a basic level, and pilots who weigh less than 136 pounds are still restricted from flying the F-35 due to issues with the ejection seat that could snap a lightweight pilot's neck. The Pentagon has said it is working with Lockheed to get a fix and lift the restriction.Despite the work that still needs to be done, the plane is ready enough. Last week, Air Force officials said that the 34th Fighter Squadron, stationed at Hill Air Force Base, had reached all the milestones required for the F-35A's IOC. The fighters tested missiles in air-to-air configurations and one even hit a drone.The Air Force's IOC declaration marks another milestone for the behind-schedule and over-budget program, which has come under intense criticism in recent years.In addition to its $400 billion procurement and $1 trillion operating and maintenance price tags, doubts how the fighter matches up against other planes have come up.For example, the military blog War Is Boring reported last year that an older F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn't equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display, or compete stealth coatings. It also tried to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, the F-22, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.On Tuesday, Carlisle alluded to those differences in the two fighter jets.""The F-35 is the best air-to air-airplane in the world except for the F-22, and the F-22 is the best air-to-ground airplane in the world except for the F-35,"" he said. ""When you look at the primary mission of the F-35, its ability to do the air-to-ground role across missions is the best capability airplane out there today. But it's not the F-22 in respect to maneuverability.""Related:What It's Really Like To Fly The F-35: A Marine Pilot Speaks

480,LMT,"With most of the Pentagon's large aircraft contracts already awarded, Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense contractors are turning their sights to missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.On Friday, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years. The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Choppa said Boeing was looking forward to turning in a proposal to the Air Force in 72 days.Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.Boeing shares were down 1.2% on the stock market today. Lockheed rose 0.85%, and Northrop added 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results. See how Lockheed's shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.  The missile contracts come after the Pentagon awarded the last major aircraft deal expected for the next decade.In October, Northrop won a contract to build new strategic bombers to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, beating a Boeing-Lockheed team. The bomber deal is estimated to be worth $50 billion-$80 billion.New fighters will be procured via the F-35 contract, which Lockheed won in 2001. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps will buy a combined 2,443 aircraft, with another 900 expected to be bought by U.S. allies. Northrop is a major subcontractor.Meanwhile, production on other fighter jets, including Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and its F-15, will shut down in the next several years, though additional orders from foreign customers could extend the production line a few more years.Boeing is developing the KC-46 tanker, which is based on its 767 commercial passenger jet, for the Air Force, though it has run into delays and major cost overruns.

"
482,LMT,"Analysts are bullish on top defense stocks Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raython (RTN), L3 Communications (LLL) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as military spending is expected to ramp up on growing tensions in Syria, Ukraine and the South China Sea.In a note Thursday, Baird analyst Peter Arment wrote that the U.S. defense budget will keep rising and contractor backlogs will get a boost from both domestic and foreign military sales.Weapons spending by the Pentagon was up 16% in fiscal year 2016 and Arment expects spending to rise at least 5% in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and will ""remain a tailwind for contractor backlogs.""Raytheon was started with an outperform rating and 170 price target by Baird. Arment wrote that the company ""was highly levered to key areas such as missile defense and prevision weaponry."" But Raytheon's sales are more dependent than peers on international sales, and lower oil prices could put pressure on weapons sales from the Middle East.Northrop, which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, was started with an outperform rating and a 260 price target as production on the stealth fighter ramps up and development of the B-21 bomber continues. But like Raytheon, Northrop also faces uncertainty from foreign buyers.Raytheon shares rose 1.12 to 138.25 on the stock market today and is consolidating in a flat base as it tries to retake its 50-day line. Northrop shares rose 1.73 to 214.21, finding resistance at the 50-day line over the last several sessions. It's also forming a base.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing, Lockheed, and others are vying for helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Baird included Raytheon and Northrop in its list of top defense picks, along with L3 Communications, which makes intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.Baird rated L3 outperform and gave it a 184 price target, saying much of its sales are tied to a growing budget for classified programs.Lockheed was also initiated with an outperform rating and a 285 price target. But the prime contractor on the F-35 didn't make the top picks list, and Arment warned that pension issues could weigh on the stock.L3 shares, which broke out of a cup base in May, edged up 2.09 to 152.54 Thursday, nearing profit-taking sell territory for those who bought at the May breakout. Lockheed dipped 1.88 to 234.72, hitting a five-month low and threatening to undercut its 200-day moving average for the first time since February.RELATED:Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid DealGermany Buys Lockheed C-130 As Airbus A400 Delays Continue Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid Deal

483,LMT,"Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg envisions hotels and factories orbiting the Earth and said its spacecraft will be the first to deliver a person to Mars, a week after SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk unveiled his Mars colonization plan.The aerospace giant is already developing the Space Launch System, which will be the most powerful rocket ever produced, for a future NASA mission to Mars. NASA plans to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s, according goals laid out in the 2010 U.S. National Space Policy.Last week, Musk said SpaceX's first manned landing on Mars may come within 10 years, though he acknowledged ""there's a good chance"" it won't happen that soon. He said he hopes to complete a developmental spaceship in four years.But Boeing isn't going to back down.""I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,"" Muilenburg said at a conference, according to Bloomberg.Boeing shares dipped 0.1% to close at 132.25 on the stock market today. Tesla fell 1.1% to 211.41.IBD'S TAKE: While SpaceX isn't publicly traded, Musk's Mars plan comes as he tries to rally support for Tesla's acquisition bid for sister company SolarCity, and critics could see his colonization vision as another distraction for Tesla, which is already surrounded by doubts about its ambitious car production targets.At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, Musk described a fleet of 1,000 spacecraft that would eventually be used to colonize Mars and estimated an investment of about $10 billion to realize the project.Boeing's Muilenburg also offered an ambitious vision for a commercialized space industry that could include hotels as well as companies engaged research and manufacturing, with Boeing providing the spacecraft to ferry people into space, according to Bloomberg.The speech is the latest salvo in a growing rivalry between the two companies.SpaceX has become a more formidable competitor to Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT), whose United Launch Alliance joint venture once had a virtual monopoly on Pentagon satellite launches.SpaceX has also been contracted by NASA to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. It also won a contract, along with Boeing, to build vehicles to send astronauts to the ISS.RELATED:SpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskTesla Vision Excellent, But Risks Still Outweigh Rewards Tesla Motors Just Made 3 Big Moves That Are Key To Its Future

485,LMT,"The White House has approved sales of Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) fighter jets to allies in the Middle East, according to reports, weeks after the U.S. agreed to a $38 billion military aid package for Israel.The jets are valued at $12 billion, but the deals would reach $20 billion if spare parts, logistical support and munitions are included, according analysts cited by Bloomberg.The White House sent notifications to the House and Senate foreign affairs committees Wednesday. Congress could still nix the deal, but analysts say that is unlikely. An initial review could last up to 40 days followed by another 30-day review.IBD's TAKE: Defense contractors are battling for foreign military sales, but the stakes are also high at home as Boeing, Lockheed, and others look to sign helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Allies in the Persian Gulf have been looking to upgrade their weapons as Washington sought to lift sanctions against their regional foe Iran.But the fighter deals had been in limbo for over two years due in part to Israel's concern that the weapons could be used against it.Then earlier this month, Washington signed a $38 billion military assistance package for Israel, which will be able to upgrade its fighters and boost its missile defense systems.RELATED: Boeing, Lockheed Still In The Hunt For Fighter Sales To IndiaBoeing, Lockheed Look To Gain As U.S. Lifts Vietnam Arms Embargo

486,LMT,"Boeing (BA) is close to an agreement to sell at least 30 widebody jets to Qatar Airways as the Middle Eastern carrier continues to be frustrated by Airbus (EADSY).Bloomberg sources said the carrier would buy 787 Dreamliners and 777 jets with a list value of $6.7 billion. But large orders typically get discounted.Akbar Al Baker, chief executive for the Middle Eastern carrier, said in August the airline would make a ""large"" purchase soon.Boeing seemed to be the likely winner as Qatar Air's relationship with Airbus continues to be strained.At the Farnborough Airshow in England in July, Al Baker said that the airline is in advanced talks with Boeing to buy up to 30 narrow-body planes, a month after canceling its first delivery of Airbus A320neo jets due to delays over an engine cooling issue.""What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth,"" he said at the air show.Boeing fell 0.5% to 131.58 in the stock market today. Airbus' U.S.-listed shares dipped 0.2% to 14.78.IBD's TAKE: Commercial sales have been slowing for Boeing, but the defense side is helping support Boeing's stock as the company looking to sign helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Meanwhile on the defense side, reports said the White House has approved sales of up to 72 Boeing F-15s for Qatar, 32 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait and 19 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-16s to Bahrain, weeks after the U.S. agreed to a $38 billion military aid package for Israel.RELATED: Airbus Deliveries Are On Track; Boeing Rival Signs Vietnamese OrdersBoeing Eyes Options For Larger 737 Max 9 To Challenge A321neo

487,LMT,"Raytheon (RTN) joined Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) in boosting its earnings outlook, as defense budgets improve and global conflicts spur demand for weapons.Raytheon now sees full-year earnings from continuing operations of $7.13-$7.33 a share, up from a prior view of $6.93-$7.13. Analysts project EPS of $7.18.Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain one-time gains, rose 12% to $1.85 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.74. Revenue climbed 3% to $6 billion, above views for $5.8 billion.Raytheon shares ended trading up 2% to 138.06 on the stock market today, putting them near their record high reached earlier in the month. Lockheed edged up 0.15% to 254.55 while Northrop lost 0.3% to 217.23.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been strong, with Raytheon, Lockheed and Northrop hitting buy points in recent weeks. See how their shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.Revenue at Raytheon's missile systems division jumped 6% to $1.66 billion on higher sales of its Paveway laser-guided bomb system.

488,LMT,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported second-quarter earnings and revenue gains Wednesday that were stronger than expected, and the company raised its full-year 2016 earnings guidance.But it also recorded a drop in technology service sales that impacted its profit margin, driving its share price down early Wednesday.Earnings rose 4% to $2.85 a share, beating analyst consensus by 32 cents a share. It's topped earnings estimates eight quarters in a row. Revenue grew 1.8% to $6 billion, edging forecasts of $5.99 billion. The Falls Church, Va.-based aerospace systems maker and military contractor lifted its 2016 earnings guidance to a range of $10.75-$11 a share, up from $10.40-$10.70 earlier, well above analyst consensus for $10.70.Northrop said second-quarter operating income declined 2% to $731 million and operating margin was down 50 basis points at 13.3%. Lower operating income reflected a decline in segment operating income and lower net pension adjustments than in the prior year period, the company said.IBD'S TAKE: Highly rated aerospace/defense systems maker Northrop Grumman rose above a first stage flat base with a 218.94 entry point, rising to 223.11, on June 30. To see how it compares with other big aerospace and defense contractors check out the IBD Stock Checkup.On Jan. 1, Northrop realigned from four to three business segments: aerospace systems, mission systems and technology services. During the quarter, aerospace systems sales rose 4% to $2.6 billion, while mission systems was up 2% at $2.69 billion. Technology services declined 2% to $1.21 billion.Northrop Grumman shares were down fractionally to 217.81 by the close on the stock market today. Its stock is up about 15% year-to-date and it has an 83 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 83% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Another aerospace firm reporting earnings, General Dynamics (GD), said second-quarter adjusted earnings rose 8% to $2.44 a share, beating estimates by 13 cents. Revenue fell 2.8% to $7.67 billion, missing Wall Street's $7.87 billion target amid lower sales in its combat systems and aerospace business.General Dynamics said it expects business jet activity to recover in the second half of 2016 and raised its full-year earnings guidance to $9.70 a share, up from $9.20 earlier and well above analyst consensus for $9.52.General Dynamics shares climbed 1.5% to 146.63 at the close.

But it already started producing some of the F-35s covered in the pending contract with its own cash flow and $625 million from the Pentagon meant to offset some costs until the final contract was approved.""If we don't get funding … we won't be able to continue that level of cash outflow,"" CFO Bruce Tanner said during the company's Q2 conference call. ""The Pentagon clearly knows that situation and I'm optimistic we are going to get cash soon.""Lockheed shares ended 1% higher on the stock market today, after rising as much as 2.8% earlier to hit a fresh record high, then reversing lower.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares finished just above buy range, after breaking out late last month. For more tips on buying and selling stocks, click here.While funding remains an issue at home, the attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on F-35 sales or production.""We have a long, long history with Turkey,"" Tanner said. ""We've worked with them since early days of the F-16s and built some F-16s there. We are also doing parts of the F-35 in Turkey.""Turkey is expected to buy 100 F-35s.Lockheed's Q2 earnings, excluding an income tax benefit, jumped nearly 10% to $3.28 per share, beating views by 35 cents.

It now sees sales of $50 billion-$51.5 billion, up from $49.6 billion-$51.1 billion. Analysts project EPS of $11.84 and revenue of $50.46 billion.Sales at Lockheed's aeronautics unit rose 6% to $4.36 billion on increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities for the F-35 program. Lockheed delivered 14 F-35s in Q2 vs. 11 a year ago.The company plans to deliver 43 F-35s this year and is expanding operations at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant so it can produce 200 jets per year by the end of 2019.Lockheed's missiles and fire control segment sales rose 2% to $1.68 billion. Sales at the space systems unit fell 3% to $2.22 billion on lower volumes of government satellite programs.The ramp-up in F-35 production is good news for other defense contractors.

Netflix (NFLX) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) were hit especially hard.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was essentially flat in the stock market today. Volume was mixed, rising 9% on the Nasdaq and declining a fraction on the NYSE compared to the same time Monday.Computer hardware, steel and entertainment stocks led on the downside, while shipping and defense stocks rose.Super Micro Computer, a maker of computer server systems and components, plunged 28% to its lowest level in more than two years. The drop came after Super Micro Computer late Monday slashed its fiscal Q4 sales and earnings outlook.Netflix tumbled nearly 14% after much weaker-than-expected subscriber growth trumped better-than-expected Q2 profit. Netflix's shares are 36% below their 52-week high. The stock has been consolidating since December.Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose as much as 3% to a new high after the defense major posted a 12% gain in Q2 profit to $3.28 a share on an 11% rise in revenue to $12.91 billion. Both figures beat Wall Street forecasts. But Lockheed stock reversed lower to dip into the red. That could be related to conference call concerns about cash usage on plane constructionLockheed Martin, maker of the F-35 fighter jet, also raised its 2016 outlook.

493,LMT,"Minus upside surprises from the likes of Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), the earnings picture would look a lot more grim.Tech is among the top sectors beating estimates for both sales and earnings per share in the most recent quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Overall S&P 500 earnings are still in a downtrend, but the pace of decline is less than feared.The market is rewarding stocks like Apple, which is trading above 100 for the first time since late April. But fund investors aren't exactly piling in. Technology ETFs saw net outflow of $617 million in July -- a month that saw real estate exchange traded funds rake in $1.2 billion in fresh money, according to State Street Global Advisors.For Dave Mazza, head of research at State Street's SPDR ETFs, that's a telling sign of investor sentiment.""In an environment where growth is scarce, I would expect to see ETF investors walk into an area that's offering growth, but we're not seeing it,"" Mazza said. This earnings season came on the heels of the Brexit vote and in the middle of presidential conventions that drove investors' attention away from company fundamentals and more toward ""bigger-picture items,"" he noted.And the broad macroeconomic outlook is awash in uncertainties.""Volatility is here to stay as investors fret over the extended age of the current bull market, a lack of earnings growth, China, Europe, and perhaps most importantly, the most divisive U.S. presidential election in recent memory,"" State Street's recent 2016 Mid-Year ETF & Investment Outlook noted. Against that backdrop, the firm has some advice for ETF investors:Smart beta strategies are low-cost and offer broad market exposure, while zeroing in on ""factors"" -- or stock characteristics -- that can give portfolios an extra boost over time, according to State Street.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Quality Mix (QEMM) are ETFs that seek out promising factors for the current market scenario.SPHD looks for S&P 500 stocks showing low risk and high yield. It has jumped 20.4% year to date vs. a 7.1 gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a comparable ETF that gives you the broad U.S. market with no extra frills.Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global, says the industrial sector is -- against the odds -- leading Q2 earnings growth, with consumer discretionary. ""The aerospace and defense industry group dominates the upside surprises for industrials this quarter and even accounted for several guidance raises,"" Bell wrote on Wednesday. Boeing (BA) landed the biggest earnings beat in the group. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and L-3 Communications (LLL) have bumped up outlook.IBD'S TAKE: To find out which exchange traded funds investing in sectors and industry groups are the current stock market leaders, check out ETF Center.Aerospace is a pocket of strength within industrials, according to Bell. ""We expect that to continue as the remainder of 2016 plays out and believe any improvement, no matter how small, in the economic environment will be a tailwind for the group into the future."" Three ETFs target this niche, including iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA).Health care is another sector with stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings growth, making it worthy of a spot on ETF watch lists.Chuck Self, CIO of iSectors, whose popular tactical ETF-based strategy invests across nine sectors, is impressed with the latest earnings beats by chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM).

494,LMT,"SpaceX and Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk described a fleet of 1,000 spacecraft Tuesday that would eventually be used to colonize Mars and estimated an investment of about $10 billion to realize the project.At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, a video presented by Musk depicted a rocket carrying passengers blasting off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., with the booster returning to Earth while the spacecraft with passengers holds in orbit.Another tanker vehicle carrying fuel is loaded back onto the booster for rendezvous with the spaceship for refueling, with the tanker returning to earth. Musk said about 3-5 trips by the tanker would be necessary to fill up the spaceship for the journey to Mars. About 100 passengers would be on each spaceship.""It will look almost exactly like what you saw,"" he said of the planned Interplanetary Transport System. ""This is not what it might look like. This is what we plan to make it look like.""Eventually, about 1,000 spaceships could be in orbit and depart en masse when optimal launch windows to Mars open up about every 26 months. He envisions about 10,000 trips to Mars.""It's kind of like Battlestar Galactica,"" Musk said. ""Good show.""Earlier, he said the four attributes needed to make the cost of Mars colonization feasible include a reusable vehicle, refueling in orbit, producing fuel on Mars for return trips, and having the right propellant. Musk said methane is  the ""clear winner"" for the fuel not existing oil-based fuels used in rockets today.Musk said he hopes to complete a developmental spaceship in four years but acknowledged the extended timeline for establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, putting the timeline at 40-100 years.IBD'S TAKE: While SpaceX isn't publicly traded, the event comes as Musk tries to rally support for Tesla's acquisition bid for sister company SolarCity, and critics could see the Mars plan as another distraction for Tesla, which is already surrounded by doubts about its ambitious car production targets.While Musk's plan is to colonize Mars, he said the spaceship would be designed to provide ""full access to the entire solar system.""SpaceX is looking at building the booster and spaceship along the U.S. Gulf coast, involving multiple states, with final assembly done at the launch site, Musk said.To pay for the Mars project, he said a public-private partnership would be needed, likening the effort to the construction of rail lines across the continental U.S., but added that he is personally accumulating assets to help fund his vision.When asked if he would be the first man on Mars, Musk replied probably not because the risk of death on the first mission would be high.Meanwhile, Boeing (BA) is developing the Space Launch System, which will be the most powerful rocket ever made for a future mission to Mars.SpaceX has become a more formidable competitor to Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT), whose United Launch Alliance joint venture once had a virtual monopoly on Pentagon satellite launches.SpaceX has also been contracted by NASA to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. It also won a contract, along with Boeing, to build vehicles to send astronauts to the ISS.Shares of Tesla closed down 1.5% at 205.81 on the stock market Tuesday. Boeing edged up 0.6% and Lockheed added 0.1%.RELATED:SpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskTesla Vision Excellent, But Risks Still Outweigh Rewards Tesla Motors Just Made 3 Big Moves That Are Key To Its Future

495,LMT,"Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) might have lost round one to France's Dassault, but there are more fighter jet deals in India's future.As expected, India signed a deal worth nearly $9 billion Friday for 36 Rafale fighter jets, rather than picking Boeing's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, Lockheed's F-16 or BAE's Eurofighter.But that quantity is just a fraction of what the country's military needs, as it looks to start replacing its roughly 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft nearing the end of their service lives. And defense analysts are bullish the U.S. companies have a good chance to win future orders.""The Indians have never bought 36 of anything,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""They buy in significant quantities.""He expects another fighter request from India in a year, but warned that governmental bureaucracy could slow things down.International sales can also get tripped up by the twists and turns of foreign relations, but Aboulafia said he has ""no doubt"" that Boeing or Lockheed jets would have an advantage in future deals, citing their quality and reliability.He added that Boeing's Super Hornet might have an edge over Lockheed's F-16 as India is looking for planes that can fly off aircraft carriers to replace its MiG-29Ks.Lockheed shares closed 0.3% lower to 245.84 in the stock market today. Boeing shares were flat.IBD'S TAKE:  Defense contractors are battling for foreign military sales, but the stakes are also high at home as Boeing, Lockheed, and others look to sign helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. India's deal Friday with Dassault was its second attempt at a fighter purchase. In 2012, New Delhi chose Dassault to build 126 new fighters. But negotiations stalled, and in July the government canceled the program, opting instead for a government-to-government deal.In trying to secure the fighter contract, Lockheed offered in August to move its F-16 manufacturing to India. And during U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter's visit to India in April, he reportedly pushed for a Boeing or Lockheed buy.RELATED: Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop To Chase $90 Billion In Missile Deals

496,LMT,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) and military officials have found a fix for faulty coolant tube insulation and expect it to finish addressing the issue by December.Last week, mechanics discovered that the insulation was eroding in 57 F-35A model planes: 13 already delivered to the Air Force, 2 to the Norwegian military and 42 still in production. No F-35B or F-35C models were affected.At the Air Force Association's Annual Air, Space and Cyber conference Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, F-35 program manager, said engineers cut holes into the wings to remove the faulty insulation. He also said there were access panels on the wings as well that could be used.The technique will be tested early next week. Once validated, the fix will be issued to the 15 planes out in the field over the next week or two. The overall process will be completed in December.""The most recent issue we are dealing with right now is not a technical issue, it is not a design issue but a quality escape from a supplier who supplied us with insulation,"" Bogdan said.Lockheed Martin wouldn't comment on which subcontractor supplied the insulation.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed are battling for billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars as the defense aerospace market is booming on increased threats in the Middle East, Russia and South China Sea.Lockheed shares rose 1.4% to 243.82 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the plane, rose 1.8% to 215.85, pennies from retaking its 50-day line.The F-35 has been plagued with problems ranging from the engine, the ejection seat, and the plane's ""brains,"" or the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) computer.Still the Air Force declared the F-35A ready for combat last month. In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and is set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.RELATED: Future Tanker Could Be Stealthy, Laser-Armed To Keep Up With F-35Northrop's B-21 Bomber Named 'Raider' After WWII Doolittle Raid Pilots

498,LMT,"Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) did their best to woo Indian officials, but France's Dassault is expected to win a lucrative deal with New Delhi to supply its Rafale fighter.The Financial Times reported Thursday that French defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was headed to India to sign a deal between the two governments. And on Wednesday, Reuters said India's cabinet OK'd the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets for nearly $9 billion. The deal is excepted to be official on Friday. France will provide spare parts for seven years and technical support, according to the FT.Boeing's F/A-18, Lockheed's F-16 and BAE's Eurofighter were also under consideration. Lockheed even offered in August to move its F-16 manufacturing to India, which would have given the country increased power over potential sales of the jet to its foe Pakistan.

Industry experts were expecting the deals to get final approval from the White House after a $38 billion defense aid package was signed with Israel last week.Qatar has requested 72 Boeing F-15E Strike Eagles, and Kuwait wants 28 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Bahrain reportedly wants to order up to 18 F-16s from Lockheed. The deals have been in limbo for over two years as Israel gets special considerations from the U.S. to maintain weapons superiority over its neighbors.But Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Defense News to expect approval for the Middle Eastern deals soon.Another foreign deal is also on the horizon. On Wednesday, the State Department approved the sale of four Boeing KC-46 refueling tankers to Japan, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The deal is estimated at $1.9 billion.Tokyo announced it wanted to buy the tanker last year and Boeing beat out the Airbus (EADSY) A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport for the bid.RELATED: Future Tanker Could Be Stealthy, Laser-Armed To Keep Up With F-35

501,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) second-quarter revenue is seen rising as F-35 production ramps up, while prospects for foreign sales may get a boost from the stealth fighter's successful demonstration at the Farnborough Airshow.Analysts expect the defense giant's EPS to dip 0.3% to $2.93, but see revenue climbing 8% to $12.56 billion, when it announces Q2 results Tuesday.Lockheed plans to deliver 43 F-35s this year but is expanding operations at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant so it can produce 200 jets per year by the end of 2019. The F-35 and other planes are vital to Lockheed as its aeronautics division, the largest single unit, accounts for roughly 34% of the company's total sales.Earlier this month, Lockheed said it was near an agreement with the Pentagon on a contract covering additional production batches for 160 more F-35s.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.The F-35's fortunes will also factor into other defense contractors' results. United Technologies (UTX) whose Pratt & Whitney division got a $1.5 billion contract in April for 99 more F-35 engines, reports July 26. Northrop Grumman (NOC), another major subcontractor on the F-35, reports July 27.Meanwhile, the F-35's cost is also coming down. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC last week that the price is now 57% lower vs. the first aircraft delivered to the Air Force in 2011 and will be fall to $85 million per plane in 2019 from $100 million now. The Pentagon has also said it will extend by two years an F-35 cost-cutting program that so far has trimmed the price tag by $1 million per plane.Reducing the cost could help ease sticker shock on Capitol Hill and increase its appeal overseas. The F-35 finally made its major international debut flying at Farnborough last week, with impressive displays of its short-takeoff, vertical-landing and hovering capabilities seen providing political cover to governments that want to buy the over-budget and behind-schedule fighter.Lockheed has been pushing to expand its foreign sales to account for 25%-30% of total sales in coming years. But the U.S. is on track to approve $40 billion in foreign military sales in fiscal 2016, down from $46.6 billion in fiscal 2015, Navy Vice Adm. Joe Rixey told Reuters at Farnborough.Still, demand from Asia is growing, and orders from the Middle East should help coming in despite an oil prices pressuring government coffers there.Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced that Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. And Japan is considering Lockheed and Boeing (BA) for a fighter jet order worth up to $40 billion.Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman met with Lockheed and other defense executives last month during his trip to Washington, as the kingdom buys missile-defense systems and bombs amid conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

504,LMT,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- The Air Force hasn't accepted delivery of Boeing's (BA) KC-46 tanker yet, but the service is already looking ahead to a possible stealthy new tanker to keep up with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.At the Air Force Association's Annual Air, Space and Cyber conference Tuesday, Gen. Carlton Everhart, commander of the Air Mobility Command, said the F-35 stealth fighter will move closer to the fight so ""it would make sense that the logistical tail would move with it.""The Air Force is conducting a study to see what a follow-on tanker would look like. But Everhart already has some high-tech ideas that include a radar-absorbing material, a laser for defense, a smaller cockpit, and fuel-efficient hybrid wings.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed are battling for billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars as the defense aerospace market is booming on increased threats in the Middle East, Russia and South China Sea.While a competition for a follow-on tanker is still years away, stealth capabilities could be key. Lockheed and Northrop Grumman (NOC) already have stealth aircraft in service, while Boeing has developed experimental stealth planes. (Boeing also was a major subcontractor on Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber.)Meanwhile, the Pentagon has been experimenting for decades with energy weapons. But Lockheed officials recently said that laser weapons are ""coming of age.""For now, the Air Force has its hands full with the KC-46.

508,LMT,"At this summer's DR1 Invitational race at Los Angeles' Sepulveda Dam, a vast, sun-baked plane of concrete, drones the size of overgrown insects carved wide cursive loops through the dam's broad archways. They threaded through slalom posts and shipping containers, punctuated by saw-toothed bursts from their rotors, and sailed to the finish line past a handful of quiet spectators and a few white tents containing tables scattered with toolboxes, extra drones and extra parts.The drones themselves can hit speeds of 80 miles per hour. And they crash a lot -- propellers snap off, frames get bent, the GoPro (GPRO) cameras often mounted to drones to capture video get smashed. That also means the pilots can gauge more quickly what propellers, batteries, frames and controllers work and which don't.""You'll find the technology in the drones that we're racing is newer than most of what is used in commercial applications, or in even military applications, because our development time is so rapid,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of the racing league MultiGP, which helped organize the race. ""We're creating this massive furnace for innovation.""The sport has grown big enough that Disney's (DIS) ESPN will air races and started with an introductory program Thursday. Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN) drone delivery plans and Facebook's (FB) intentions to use drones to strengthen internet access are helping to push the aircraft into the mainstream. But flying under the radar is a loosely-knit community of tinkerers creating a groundswell of activity that some have compared with the early years of the PC revolution embodied by Apple (AAPL) a generation ago.And as these drone wildcatters stumble upon ways to improve the aerial devices -- and forge a regulatory framework -- an array of companies is also circling to tap into the entrepreneurial energy.""The drone industry is probably one of the first open-source hardware industries,"" said James Peverill, CEO of GreenSight Agronomics, a Boston-based startup that uses drones for agricultural imaging and analytics and which has done work with golf courses and agrochemical giant Syngenta (SYT).""It almost harkens back to the beginnings of the personal computer industry,"" he added. ""In the late 70s, people were experimenting with computers in the basement, and when Apple Computer was founded, they basically used a lot of the ideas and technology from that DIY community that had hatched.""While few public companies are pure-play drone stocks, the financial industry has been offering broader exposure to the market. PureFunds describes its Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY), which debuted in March, as the first exchange traded fund devoted to tracking the commercial drone market.The fund's holdings include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors, drone-maker AeroVironment (AVAV), GoPro and its chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA).""We've seen drones start to transcend the initial aerospace and defense uses into many different industries and sectors around the world,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. ""Trying to play the drone industry -- or any early-stage industry -- by picking one or two companies can be a pretty difficult and volatile proposition.""Amazon has been approved to test delivery drones in the U.K, and Alphabet (GOOGL) this summer got the OK for limited delivery-drone testing in the U.S. But despite the entrance of several tech Goliaths, the drone space is still so wide open that upstarts can aim high.Back when Amazon's drone plans were in a younger stage, Skycart, a drone delivery startup in San Jose, Calif., that started roughly four years ago, was trying to sell companies on the idea of using drones to send things.""Those companies thought we were joking,"" said Lukas Wrede, the company's CEO.Then, Amazon published a video demonstrating Prime Air, its future drone delivery service, and Wrede initially thought Skycart was done for. But he rethought.""If such a big company gets a lot of attention and they also have a powerful lobby, then they could probably influence the market in our interest,"" he said. ""And that's what they did.""Skycart also continued to improve its drone technology, enhancing its autonomous-flight and drop-off capabilities and its abilities to carry packages weighing 10 pounds, up from an earlier target of 5. Today, Skycart has started several delivery projects with their customers, which Wrede characterized as Amazon rivals who have become more aware of the possibilities of drone delivery. Among them is one of the biggest shipping express companies in the U.S., but he declined to identify it.Meanwhile, at the University of Southern California, assistant professor John Carlsson has been developing a delivery model in which drones carrying packages bounce between a moving delivery truck and their destination -- potentially cutting time, traffic and fuel costs.His means of testing this particular model? A drone and a skateboard. Still, he said, he has been approached by a handful of companies, including a multibillion-dollar retailer that sells a variety of products, but which he said is ""not Amazon.""He said he will be ""working on a project with them that will involve drones"" in the next several months that will either incorporate the delivery model or his other drone-related research, which has been backed by U.S. defense funding.""The kind of thing that we work on specifically is really applicable to any situation where you have one large vehicle, and a collection of smaller vehicles that are somehow tied to that,"" he said.As more drones swarm the skies and raise the risk of midair collisions, regulations have struggled to catch up, forcing the community of drone racers and other enthusiasts to cobble together solutions -- similar to the way they improvise technologies for their drones.The Sepulveda Dam race was two years in the making, said Brad Foxhoven, CEO Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers. Thomas, of MultiGP, said that conversations had to happen between the site's owner and with the FAA, and a film permit had to be obtained.""Nothing like that has ever been permitted before,"" he said. ""We essentially had to look toward the jungle, take out our machetes and cut a path. We're building a sport from scratch.""Permitting, in general, though, is ""like they're trying to put a round peg into a square hole,"" Thomas said.The FAA and Transportation Department in June finalized regulations for small drone use, and the rules took hold last month. Still, some state and local officials are seeing a drone up close for the first time and regulators face information gaps. For example, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act requires drone operators within five miles of an airport to notify that airport of their presence, but the lines of communication weren't always clear. So companies saw an opening.""People were knocking on the door of the airport manager or calling on the phone and saying 'Hey I'm going to fly my drone at the 7-Eleven,' "" said Ben Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Santa-Monica-based tech company AirMap. ""Airport managers were like: 'What am I supposed to do with that?' ""AirMap's technology offers up a smartphone-accessible map of what's happening in the low-altitude airspace. Their technology lets airports know what drones are in the skies nearby, and provides a communications platform between pilots, airports and others. If you're flying a drone and, say, a jet approaches, AirMap will send an alert. The technology can also provide information on temporary flight restrictions -- wildfires, a sporting event, presidential visits, Marcus said.More than 100 airports use AirMap's technology, including Los Angeles International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental and other U.S. hubs, said co-founder Gregory McNeal.""Ultimately, when Amazon and Google and other companies are looking to make deliveries, they're going to need to know about all of these types of pieces of low-altitude airspace information, some of which is dynamic,"" McNeal said. ""So the county fair comes to town, and the Ferris wheel goes up. The Amazon drone should know about that before it ever gets to the county fair.""Back at the DR1 race, the Sepulveda Dam was decorated with logos for Pepsico's (PEP) Mountain Dew and Doritos as well as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). The event was broadcast on Twitch, the gaming-centric streaming service Amazon bought in 2014. And in August, the 2016 National Drone Racing Championships took place in New York, an event broadcast via ESPN.And in separate announcements Wednesday, ESPN and U.K. media giant Sky struck deals with the Drone Racing League, another racing group, to broadcast five races over 10 episodes. An introductory broadcast is set to air Thursday on ESPN2, with the others to be broadcast there, ESPN and Sky Sports Mix in October. Sky, which is 39% owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), also invested $1 million in the league.Blockade Entertainment's Foxhoven, meanwhile, said his company has had ""multiple conversations"" with people in the e-sports industry, some of whom attended the DR1 Invitational.As the racing community gains more mass appeal, the innovations it has made are starting to trickle out. The Drone Racing League has had ""quite a few outside parties"" approach them about potentially licensing its radio-system technology for non-drone-racing uses, founder and CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski said.""It's been fun to discover that in the process of developing this for a particular purpose, in this case sports, we've developed technology that has a broader application that can be used in other capacities in a positive and productive way,"" he said in an interview.Peverill, of GreenSight Agronomics, said his company uses a flight controller sometimes used in racing. And some companies are also scoping out racing events to see how drones can help their own products.Staff from GoPro, the event's title sponsor, attended the National Drone Racing Championships partly to get more of a sense of how drones could be used to provide more immersive, closer-to-actually-being-there camera work, said Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, which organized the event.Enterprise data-storage giant EMC (EMC), which also backed the event, ran live demos of virtual reality technology there. AIG (AIG), a partner in the event and an issuer of drone insurance, has been working with the DSA to generate ideas on how to improve insurance for aerial devices as low-altitude airspace grows more crowded and complicated, Refsland said.Elsewhere, Justin Haggerty, founder of the competing International Drone Racing Association, said his organization has attracted interest from telecommunications companies looking to learn more about their technology. Among them was Korean telecom giant KT Corp. (KT), which Haggerty said is looking at ways to use drones for broadcasting.Meanwhile, the educational nonprofit Drones Pilot Federation sees drone racing as a crossover into education. Henry Minden, a vice president in the group, said the aerial devices have the potential to teach younger people, ages 12 to 30, about computer programming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and assembly, and create new jobs in those areas.""You want to know how to go faster than the rest,"" he said. ""So you find yourself immersed in this world of physics, aerodynamics, electrical engineering and computer science.""In the process, many people involved in the informal community of drone enthusiasts have become advocates for wider application of the devices, which are still best known for their years of use in the military.""If I could just share this with more people, and especially take away the negative connotations,"" said Tommy Tibajia, one of the pilots at the DR1 race. ""Because, whenever I'm flying, (people) are like, 'Stop spying on me!' I'm like, 'Lady, trust me. I'm not spying on you.'

509,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be deployed to Europe and the Pacific without notice as a show of force, according to a top Air Force official.In similar displays, Lockheed F-22s were sent to Lakenheath, England, for a surprise training mission to show adversaries that the U.S. has ""the rapid ability to move airplanes,"" Gen. Herbert Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command, said after a congressional hearing Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.""As soon as I get them operational, I'd like to do that with the F-35s as well, to demonstrate that I can move those airplanes anywhere I need to as rapidly as I can to support combatant commanders' needs -- whether it's in a peacetime training environment, messaging to potential adversaries, or if we ever had to, in the face of conflict,"" he said.Lockheed shares ended virtually flat in the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, dipped 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Despite Thursday's moves, defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.Meanwhile, the Air Force's version of the F-35 is on track to be declared combat ready this year.There are no technical issues that would delay the F-35A from receiving its initial operational capability status in the current scheduled time frame of August to December, Carlisle said, reiterating prior remarks from the Air Force.There have been some major issues with the plane's development over the years, leaving it behind schedule and over budget.A problem with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine forced the fleet to be temporarily grounded in 2014, but the Pentagon said it has since resolved those issues. The plane has also seen problems with its Autonomic Logistics Information System and software issues.The Marine variant of the fighter, the F-35B, was declared combat-ready last July and will be sent to Iwakuni, Japan, in early 2017, but the Marines said the jet is capable of deploying the F-35 to the Middle East for combat, if necessary.The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019. It will conduct a third round of shipboard tests aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington in August, according to a report from Defense News.""They're going to open up the full envelope of the airplane to land and take off from the carrier, which means things like heavyweight, asymmetric stores, heavy cross winds, high seas,"" Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, F-35 program manager, said. ""Plus we'll do a lot of reliability, maintainability and maintenance administrations to make sure we get that right.""

510,LMT,"Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said at the Farnborough Airshow that the airline is in advanced talks with Boeing (BA) to buy up to 30 narrowbody planes, a month after canceling its first delivery of Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jets due to delays.Baker also warned Monday that more Airbus cancellations could be on the way if progress isn't made to speed up deliveries.Meanwhile, Boeing said it would stretch its 737 Max 7 jet to make room for 12 additional seats in an effort to compete with Bombardier's C Series model. Boeing said customers, including Southwest Airlines (LUV), have shown interest in a longer model. But Boeing didn't announce a stretched version of its 180-seat 737 Max 9 to answer Airbus's A321 neo.This year's Farnborough Airshow isn't expected to see blockbuster deals, but some notable ones were announced Monday.China's Donghai Airlines said it will buy 25 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and five 787-9 Dreamliners in a deal valued at over $4 billion at list prices. Airlines, however, typically get discounts for large orders. Boeing also signed a memorandum of understanding to sell 30 737 Max 200 planes to Xiamen Airlines for $3.4 billion at list prices.IBD'S TAKE: Watch for Boeing's decision on whether to extend a next-generation 737 model or develop a new, midrange passenger jet as it looks to counter Airbus sales in the market gap left by the end of 757 production.On the defense side, the U.K. finalized a $3.88 billion contract for nine new Boeing P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft. In January, the Royal Australian Air Force ordered four of the planes to replace its aging Lockheed AP-3C Orions. British officials also announced a deal for 50 Boeing Apache helicopters.Virgin Atlantic will buy eight of Airbus' new A350 widebody jets and plans to lease another four, calling the jet its ""future flagship."" Airbus also signed a deal with Israel's Arkia Israeli Airlines to up to four A330-900neo aircraft. Vietnam's Jetstar Pacific Airlines signed a memorandum of understand for 10 A320ceo aircraft.But Airbus could follow those announcement with much bigger ones later this week. The European aerospace giant is near an agreement to sell as much as 100 planes, likely A321neo jets, to AirAsia in a deal worth $12.57 billion at list prices, according to Bloomberg. Airbus is also in talks with Go Airlines India to sell 70 A320neo planes worth $7.5 billion.Boeing shares closed up 1.5% on the stock market today. Airbus climbed 2.2%.Concerns of a slowing global economy and worries over the U.K. leaving the European Union haven't put a damper on demand expectations at Boeing and Airbus.Boeing raised its 20-year demand estimate by 4.1% vs. last year, now estimating that the world's airlines will need 39,620 new aircraft over the next two decades. Boeing sees strong demand from fledgling Asian carriers as more people travel for leisure and business in the region. Despite current low fuel costs, Boeing also sees demand for more fuel efficient planes, like its 737 Max, rising.Meanwhile, rival Airbus sees demand for 33,070 new aircraft valued at $5.2. trillion over the next 20 years, up by 500 planes from its prior outlook. It sees passenger traffic growing by an average of 4.5% a year over the next two decades, with the middle class in developing countries doubling to 3.5 million people by 2035.Also Monday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC that the price on the F-35 is down 57% from the first aircraft delivered to the Air Force in 2011 and will be down to $85 million per plane in 2019. Currently the jet costs $100 million. The Pentagon said it will extend by two years an F-35 cost-cutting program that so far has trimmed the price tag by $1 million per plane.Lockheed shares rallied 1%.

512,LMT,"To counter an increasingly aggressive North Korea, South Korea and the U.S. agreed late Thursday to deploy Lockheed Martin's (LMT) anti-missile system.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Washington and Seoul have been in talks about deploying THAAD since February, according to a release from the Pentagon.Lockheed shares rose 0.85% to 251.90 in the stock market today, hitting a new high. Shares are still in buy range from a 245.47 buy point.The deployment comes as North Korea test-fired mid-range ballistic missiles in June that have the capability of hitting Guam and U.S. military facilities in Okinawa, Japan. Pyongyang also has tested nuclear devices that it claimed can be loaded onto a missile.While the Pentagon said THAAD's presence in South Korea would ""be focused solely on North Korean nuclear and missile threats and would not be directed towards any third party nations,"" Russia and China oppose the move.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks like Lockheed have been strong despite overall economic uncertainty, with some of the top Pentagon contractors entering buy range recently. Meanwhile, companies that largely serve the commercial market haven't fared as well.Meanwhile, tensions in other parts of the world, like the Middle East, have helped boost sales of Patriot air-defense systems from Raytheon (RTN).Raytheon shares rose 0.1.1% to 138.49, setting a new high.
"
513,LMT,"Military planes, including Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, may steal the spotlight at next week's Farnborough Airshow, as demand for commercial jets from Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) cools.The Air Force's F-35A and the Marine Corps' F-35B version will fly Friday at the Royal International Air Tattoo, which is an earlier lead-in event to the Farnborough show. The F-35B will also be showcased at Farnborough, which runs July 11-17.While Farnborough is typically an event where big commercial orders are announced, it is still a major opportunity for defense contractors to show off their wares and lay the groundwork for future military orders. And for the F-35 in particular, flying demonstrations could help shield governments from criticism over plans to buy the over-budget and behind-schedule plane.""The F-35 will provide cover to military leaders and politicians that have taken heat at home,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""They can say 'See it's ready for prime-time. We were right to order it.' ""IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks like Lockheed have been strong despite overall economic uncertainty, with some of the top Pentagon contractors entering buy range recently. Meanwhile, companies that largely serve the commercial market haven't fared as well.The U.K. appearance will be the first time U.S. pilots will fly the F-35 in an international air show and mark its debut at a major event. Dutch pilots flew the jet at a local military air show last month. The F-35 was supposed to make its international debut two years ago in the U.K., but the fleet was temporarily grounded after an engine fire.The Pentagon has noted recent improvements in the F-35 program, and a top Air Force official said Thursday that software fixes for its logistics and maintenance system is progressing. Lockheed's F-35 program manager also said the company and the Defense Department are close to reaching a deal on a production contract for the next batch of planes.Lockheed shares closed down 0.1% on the stock market today but remain in buy territory.Boeing's P-8 also will be a headliner at Farnborough, as the U.K. is considering buying nine more, and other European countries are looking at the anti-submarine aircraft, Aboulafia said. In January, the Royal Australian Air Force ordered four of the planes to replace its aging Lockheed AP-3C Orions.Other military planes on display at the show include Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and the Eurofighter Typhoon.Meanwhile, no blockbuster commercial deals are expected at Farnborough, as worries of a slowing global economy and air traffic growth rates are putting a damper on orders.""The macro market environment on the commercial side still has problems where the industry is doing better than the world economy would suggest,"" Aboulafia said.On Wednesday, Airbus said net orders for the first half of the year totaled 183, well off its pace to reach 650 by year's end. Boeing has booked 276 net orders through June 28.The economy isn't the only headwind the aerospace heavyweights are facing. The C Series from Canada's Bombardier is becoming a formidable rival, and orders for the new jets could be a source of surprises at the show.The C Series has faced developmental delays and slow sales since its inception nearly 10 years ago. But earlier this year, Bombardier scored an order for 75 narrow-body CS100 jets from Delta Air Lines (DAL), with an option for 50 more, the largest-ever order for Bombardier's commercial aircraft business.Bombardier ""pretty much has been humiliated at every air show in the past decade, but they are under new management and doing better, so it might be time to show off for new prospects,"" Aboulafia said.A Moody's report out in May also said Bombardier ""likely has the most technically proficient model in this class of aircraft,"" focused on the 100-150 seat market.Boeing's big announcement likely will be the finalization of an order from Iran, according to Robert Mann, president of aviation consultancy R.W. Mann & Co.Last month, Boeing and Iran reached a tentative deal for more than 100 commercial planes, marking the first such deal between the U.S. aerospace giant and the Islamic republic since its 1979 revolution.But Mann said issues over restrictions from the State Department and Treasury had to be resolved before official details are announced.Less likely, according to Mann, would be a big announcement of a new mid-range jet or a stretched version of its 737 Max from Boeing. But Aboulafia said it was still a possibility.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mike Delaney, Boeing's vice president of airplane development, said a new plane ""is coming faster than you think"" but added that the idea would still need the board's approval.Boeing said in February it was surveying customers about the need for a midsize plane to replace the 757, which was last produced in 2004.Drones will be a big part of the airshow for the first time. Lauren Kisser, Director of Amazon Prime Air, will present at the U.K. Drone Show portion of Farnborough, giving an overview of the drone delivery system Amazon (AMZN) is developing. A drone racing event is also scheduled.

514,LMT,"Earnings season was in full swing this week, with Netflix (NFLX), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), General Motors (GM) among those reporting. Elon Musk unveiled his new Tesla Motors (TSLA) ""master plan."" Meanwhile Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) announced it will buy U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH), while the Justice Department blocked two big health insurance merger deals.The S&P 500 and Dow hit fresh highs while the Nasdaq set new 2016 bests as all three rose modestly for a fourth straight weekly gain. Facebook (FB), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) were among a slew of stocks hitting buy points, though Facebook's low-volume breakout struggled. Several other highly rated big names are close to entry points. Oil prices retreated to below $45 a barrel.Internet television network Netflix attracted just 1.68 million new customers in the second quarter vs. its target for 2.5 million. For Q3, Netflix expects to add 2.3 million new subscribers, vs. analyst estimates for 3.7 million. Netflix blamed the slowing subscriber growth on increased churn related to price increases for longtime subscribers. It also said the Summer Olympics will put the brakes on new subscriber gains in August. Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses. But Mobileye, a maker of driver-assistance technology used by Tesla and many other automakers, has strong fundamentals. MBLY cleared a new handle entry point at 49.10 on Friday. For detailed ratings on Mobileye, go to IBD Stock Checkup.The software giant earned 69 cents a share ex items in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 11% vs. a year earlier as revenue climbed 2% to $22.64 billion. Analysts had expected EPS to fall to 58 cents on sales of $22.15 billion. Microsoft credited strong sales of cloud computing software and services for the Q4 beat. For the just-started fiscal year, it vowed to improve the profitability of its cloud businesses including Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft shares rose 5.3% to 56.57 this week, close to a buy point of 56.87.Japan's SoftBank will pay $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, which designs chips for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, as well as for most other smartphones and the booming Internet of Things market. The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views. Still, Chipotle shares rose 9.3% this week, retaking the 50-day line. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) beat views, with EPS up 21% to 98 cents on 12% revenue growth to $547.3 million. Domino's stock broke out to a new high, leaping 9.6%. Papa John's (PZZA) popped 6% as KeyBanc said pizza deliveries are faring well amid civil unrest.Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed with a Q3 revenue miss and in-line EPS, as adjusted profit grew 17% to 49 cents on 7% sales growth to $5.24 billion. But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong. Yahoo (YHOO) Q2 EPS missed by a penny but revenue and Q3 revenue guidance easily beat forecasts. Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta. Biogen (BIIB) rose after its beat and raised, but its CEO George Scangos said he was quitting after six years.J&J stock rose modestly to a fresh high. Novartis advanced slightly, and Biogen jumped nearly 11% as biotech stocks tried to recover.General Motors (GM) reported strong Q2 profit growth, topping estimates. GM revenue surged 11.5%, the fastest pace since 2010, although some industry officials say U.S. auto sales could level off this year. GM stock rose 4.5% for the week.. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which reports July 27, is under investigation by the Justice Department for unspecified fraud, according to people familiar with the matter. Ford (F) reports next week. Volkswagen (VLKAY) is mulling building an electric vehicles plant either at its Chattanooga, Tenn., site or in Mexico.General Electric (GE) reported a 65% EPS gain for Q2, much better than expected, but industrial orders fell 16%, and core organic revenue fell too. Honeywell (HON), another diversified industrial giant, topped EPS views but missed on sales. Honeywell cut its full-year organic revenue forecast to a small drop. GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

530,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The $1.5 billion in charges Boeing (BA) has taken on its new tanker won't be punishment enough, as the Air Force is in negotiations with the aerospace giant for penalties related to missing key milestones.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said at an International Institute for Strategic Studies talk Monday that there will be ""considerations"" and that negotiations have already started but that it is too early to say what the penalties may be.Earlier, the Air Force said the contract didn't include predefined penalties for missed milestones.""As with any contract schedule breach, the Air Force will seek consideration commensurate with the impact of the breach,""  Air Force spokesman Maj. Robert Leese told Breaking Defense.Boeing shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today.Last month, Brig. Gen. Duke Richardson, the program executive officer for tankers, said the first 18 Boeing KC-46 tankers will now be delivered to the Air Force in January 2018 and will have some operational limitations, such as being unable to provide fuel via pods on the plane’s wings. That capability will be delivered in October 2018. The tanker was supposed to hit military runways in early 2015.Richardson said the government wouldn’t be on the hook for costs due to the delay. The tanker, which is a modified version of Boeing’s 767 commercial aircraft, is under a fixed-cost contract, so all the cost overruns must be covered by Boeing.The company took a $243 million pretax charge on the tanker program in the first quarter, bringing additional engineering and manufacturing costs to a total of $1.5 billion.Delays over the tanker could have contributed to Northrop Grumman's (NOC) win over a Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for the B-21 long strike bomber contract last year. And the KC-46 delay could also affect Boeing's chances in future Pentagon contract competitions.Meanwhile, Boeing's European rival Airbus (EADSY) is having is own troubles over the engine propeller gearbox production of its new A400M military transport plane.Airbus shares fell 2.65%.

Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing. With the ruling, GE will no longer have to follow minimum capital and liquidity requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) label was put on GE Capital in 2013.

The employment measure rose 1.2 points to 50.4, the first positive reading of 2016. The export orders gauge rose to its best level since late 2014. Separately, U.S. automakers reported strong U.S. sales, with most roughly in line with analyst expectations.The June employment report is due July 8, but with the Federal Reserve likely on hold for the foreseeable future, it may not have as great a market impact.The No. 1 sportswear brand topped analysts' profit views by a penny with flat year-over-year Q4 EPS of 49 cents.

Nike sees high-single-digit reported revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Q1 guidance disappointed.

But the problem is far from resolved. The world's largest automaker still faces multiple lawsuits. And after Volkswagen confirmed the U.S. settlement, Europe's Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska called on Volkswagen to offer similar compensation to VW buyers in Europe, Reuters reported. Volkswagen fell 2.6% for the week.Tesla Motors confirmed late Thursday that regulators are probing a fatal crash of a Model S operating in self-driving mode.

Williams, which is seeking monetary damages, fell 3.5%, largely on the surprise news that its chairman and five other board members resigned.In what some view as a defensive play against Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon.com set July 12 for its second annual deal-loaded Prime Day -- expected to be its biggest shopping day of the year. Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines.

ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations.

533,LMT,"Despite major delays with the new Boeing (BA) tanker for the Air Force, the company's new defense chief expects more commercial jets to be converted for military use.Leanne Caret, president of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security, told the Wall Street Journal that the company wasn't getting out of the fighter jet business all together, but it was instead focusing on maintenance and upgrades for current jets and selling more military versions of its passenger jets.Orders for its F-15s and F/A- 18 jets have slowed, with new jets on the market like the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35. But analysts warn that a focus on transport jets and helicopters won't make up for falling fighter jet sales.Boeing is bullish on new contracts like the T-X Air Force trainer, a drone for the Navy and new ballistic missiles. The report said Boeing has sold over 100 of its 737s with surveillance equipment to the U.S., India and Australia. It also is working on the KC-46 tanker, a modified version of Boeing’s 767 commercial aircraft, and expects to sell up to 400.But it hasn't been clear skies for the tanker project. The plane is under a fixed-cost contract, so Boeing is on the hook for all cost overruns. The company reported a $156 million charge in the first quarter on the KC-46, putting the program’s additional engineering and manufacturing costs at nearly $1 billion. Boeing will not be able to deliver the first batch of KC-46 aerial refueling tankers in August 2017 as promised. The tanker was originally supposed to hit military runways in early 2015.Analysts earlier speculated that Boeing’s failure to hit milestones with the tanker was one of the major reasons Northrop Grumman (NOC) was awarded the lucrative B-21 bomber contract last year instead of the Boeing-Lockheed team.The delay could also affect other future military contacts for Boeing.Boeing shares closed down 1.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.6%. Lockheed shares ended virtually flat.Boeing isn't the only aerospace giant having trouble with military planes. In April, Airbus (EADSY) warned of a “serious challenge” over the engine propeller gearbox production of its new A400M transport plane.Airbus shares lost 2.1%.

Opposition politicians earlier had voiced concerns about the cost of the jets.Boeing pitched its older F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, and Airbus’ pitched its Eurofighter Typhoon.Lockheed rose 0.1% to 240.67 in the stock market today, continuing to consolidate after peaking at 245.37 on May 12.Boeing stock closed up 0.1%, and Airbus shares fell 1.3%.The first four F-35s will be delivered in 2021 with the final planes delivered in 2026.Denmark is the 11th country to buy the new F-35A jets along with the U.K., Australia, Italy and Israel.The U.S. Air Force is working to get the plane ready for combat approval later this year.

535,LMT,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is meeting with Defense Secretary Ash Carter Wednesday as the Pentagon tries to enlist Silicon Valley to be more active in defense and as Musk's SpaceX takes on defense stalwarts Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) in rocket launches.Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters Monday that the defense chief and the Tesla chief would discuss ""innovation.""""Elon Musk is one of the most innovative minds in this country, and the secretary, as you know, has been reaching out to a number of members of the technology community to get their ideas, their feedback, find out what's going on in the world of innovation,"" he said.Tesla shares finished 1.4% higher. Boeing edged up 0.8% and Lockheed added 0.4%.The meeting also comes as Musk's SpaceX takes on defense contracts, and as the Pentagon and Congress battle over the use of Russian-made engines in U.S. rocket launches.SpaceX was certified for military space launches last year, joining legacy provider United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, as the only two companies approved for military payloads.Last month, the Pentagon awarded SpaceX a contact to send a GPS satellite into orbit, ending ULA's virtual monopoly on military space launches. ULA didn't bid on the contract due to SpaceX's cheaper pricing and issues with ULA's use of RD-180 Russian-built engines.Washington levied sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, putting restrictions on the number of engines ULA could use.But ULA and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin are working on building the BE-4 liquid rocket engine to replace the Russian one. The U.S.-built engine is expected to be ready for launch vehicles by 2019.Still, ULA and some lawmakers want restrictions eased on the Russian engines, warning they threaten U.S. space capabilities until the replacement is ready.Earlier this week, Sen. Bill Nelson, D- Fla., introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would allow the joint venture to have unlimited access to the RD-180 engines until the end of 2022.But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long been critical of using Russian engines and wants the Air Force to prove that buying them doesn't violate U.S. sanctions.Meanwhile, Carter has been pushing for cooperation between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley and last year he became the first sitting defense chief in nearly two decades to visit the tech hub.The Pentagon also has a new Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx) outreach office in Mountain View, Calif.So far, DIUx has been a flop. Only three out of 20 project were given contracts in eight months, according to Bloomberg. The Pentagon is notorious for being slow and risk averse, while Silicon Valley ventures are used to quickly getting funding after a successful product pitch.Tech companies are also especially hesitant about working with the Pentagon after Edward Snowden’s leaks over digital surveillance.Still, Carter believes in the outreach effort and made changes to try to speed up the process.

536,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) missile sales are expected to rise as the U.S. continues its bombing campaign in the Middle East, and NATO countries boost spending to counter an increasingly aggressive Russia.And late Tuesday, the Pentagon awarded Boeing (BA) a $3.2 billion contract for Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which use GPS to guide bombs. The pact is an expansion from a $1.75 billion contract awarded in October 2014.In a note earlier Tuesday, Berenberg analysts said they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7% to 8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand."" Patriot Advanced Capability missile sales are expected to stay in line with 2015 levels.Berenberg said Lockheed has outperformed its peers in the last 12 months except for Northrop Grumman (NOC). Northrop Grumman beat out a Boeing-Lockheed team late last year for the new B-21 long-range strike bomber.But the analysts downgraded Lockheed to hold, on price momentum. Lockheed shares closed up 0.8% Wednesday after falling 1.6% Tuesday. Northrop shares rose 0.7%, and Boeing edged up 0.2%.In December, the Air Force said it has dropped over 20,000 missiles and bombs in its fight against ISIS, depleting stockpiles below what some see as optimal. The U.S. also is approving munitions sales to Middle East allies.NATO countries are expected to boost spending this year for the first time in ""many, many years,"" the group's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told the Financial Times.Last year, NATO's European forces spent $353 billion on defense vs. $618 billion by the U.S., according to the Times.

537,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Restarting production of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 ""is not a crazy idea,"" Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh said Thursday.The House Armed Services Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee earlier this year ordered a study on how much that would cost, and it will be completed soon, he said at an Air Force Association breakfast.""The success of the F-22 and the capability of the airplane ... has proven that the airplane is exactly what everyone hoped it would be,"" Welsh said.Lockheed shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today.While the Air Force's top uniformed officer appears to be open to the idea of restarting the F-22, officials like the Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James have said that it's cost prohibitive.A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building just 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion-$17.4 billion in 2008 dollars, depending on a variety of factors. Lockheed did not respond to requests for comment.The F-22 program was canceled in 2009 with only 187 operational planes — less than half of the 381 the Air Force requested — as costs soared. That year, President Obama said expanding the F-22’s budget would be “an inexcusable waste of money,” and Congress took away $1.75 billion in 2009 for additional planes in the 2010 budget.Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates also said that more F-22s were not wanted or needed by the military, and the final F-22 was built in 2011.Since then, the Pentagon has been touting the over-budget and behind-schedule Lockheed F-35, which is a multirole fighter while the F-22 is an air-superiority fighter.But some analysts and members of Congress, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, are still concerned about the abilities of the F-35 vs. older U.S. jets as well as fighters made by Russia and China.In regards the Air Force's other new plane, Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, Welsh said that the issue of precisely how many planes will be built is still eight to 10 years away.The Air Force assumes about 100 will be made, but for now, the service is working on getting the program on track, under costs, and on schedule.""This is like having a debate about the number of F-35s 10 to 12 years ago,"" he said.Northrop shares dipped 0.2%.

539,LMT,"Critics have said trying to develop and build Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 simultaneously is a major flaw in the program, but top officials said giving the plane to operators is ""probably the best thing"" for furthering development.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, top Pentagon weapons tester Michael Gilmore and others have questioned the F-35's ""concurrency."" The Government Accountability Office also said in multiple reports that high levels of concurrency were a major driver of increased costs and schedule delays.But Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program’s executive officer, told reporters late Tuesday that getting the F-35 to initial operating capability (IOC) with the Marines last year, without full war-fighting capabilities, has helped the joint program office learn more about pilot and maintenance crews' requirements and other issues with the plane.""Despite the limited capability the airplane has today, getting it in the hands of the warfighter and having them use it is probably the best thing we can do to further development,"" he said.The Air Force will weigh a similar trade-off as its version of the F-35 nears IOC. Top Pentagon procurement officer Frank Kendall said that milestone could still come between August and December.Bogdan has been a proponent of getting the plane ready for IOC by Aug. 1. But issues with the aircraft’s Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) will drive the schedule, he said.Right now, four of the five updates will be ready in August or September, but integrating engine information into ALIS won't happen until October or November.""We presented that information to the Air Force and will let the Air Force decide what they choose to do,"" Bogdan said. ""It's entirely possible to deliver all of the deployable capabilities without the engine capability, but that's a decision the Air Force will have to make.""Sean Stackley, the Navy's acquisition chief, noted the F-35 program office can tailor ALIS updates to address specific needs from the field.""This is a case of a complex system that is maturing much quicker now that the operators have their hands on it and can point us to some things that are highest priority to them,"" he said.Lockheed shares dipped less than 0.1% on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major subcontractors, fell 0.2% and rose 0.4%, respectively.

541,LMT,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) could be big winners in Vietnam, as the U.S. fully lifts its arms embargo against its one-time enemy 41 years after the close of the Vietnam War. The country has been on an arms-buying spree amid tensions over China’s expansion in the South China Sea, and it is looking to reduce its reliance on Russian weapons in favor of U.S. and European alternatives. Vietnam is the world’s No. 8 arms importer, with sales jumping nearly 700% since 2005, Reuters reported, citing data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Vietnam's military needs maritime patrol aircraft, such as used P-3Cs from Lockheed, as well as aerial refueling tankers like Boeing's new KC-46 -- which is facing cost overruns and development delays -- or Airbus' (EADSY) A330 MRTT, said Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.Other requirements include fighter jets, such as Lockheed's F-16 or Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet. Vietnam could also be interested in helicopters from Boeing and Lockheed’s Sikorsky division, in addition to precision-guidance munitions from Raytheon and Boeing.Hanoi is likewise interested in the littoral combat ship (LCS) but first needs to put its air capabilities in order, Bobbi said. The ship is smaller than most U.S. Navy vessels and is designed for missions close to shore. Lockheed and General Dynamics (GD) make separate versions of the LCS.All that represents a tall order for Vietnam, but Bobbi said the country's dynamic, high-growth economy should allow the military to pay for a major upgrade.""The question of affordability is not as big a deal in respect to Vietnam vs. other countries, again because of their strong growth,"" he said.Hanoi could make its first orders before the end of the year. While President Obama signed an order lifting the arms embargo, the White House must notify Congress of sales of certain weapons. Even then, Bobbi sees few opponents in Congress to approving such deals.The announcement came as Obama starts a three-day visit to Vietnam, with the move seen as the latest U.S. effort to try to contain China's advances in the South China Sea. But Obama denied China was a factor.“The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations,” Obama said at a press conference in Hanoi. ""We’re going to continue to engage in the case-by-case evaluation of these sales. But what we do not have is a ban that is based on an ideological division between our two sides.""Meanwhile, demand from Asia more generally could help offset a slowdown in orders from Middle Eastern customers as oil prices remain depressed. U.S. defense contractors have targeted foreign sales after the Pentagon began reducing troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Lockheed wants foreign sales to account for 25% to 30% of total sales in coming years.On the commercial side, Boeing finalized an $11.3 billion order from VietJet Air on Monday. The carrier ordered 100 of Boeing's 737 Max 200 single-aisle airplanes, the largest order for a Vietnamese passenger carrier and one that will double VietJet’s fleet to over 200 planes. Deliveries are scheduled between 2019 and 2023.Obama also announced an agreement between General Electric's (GE) (GE) wind-energy unit and Vietnam to develop 1,000 megawatts of electricity.Boeing shares rose 0.15% on the stock market today.

543,LMT,"Northrop Grumman's (NOC) new B-21 stealth bomber will likely be ""margin dilutive,"" though details on the secretive program are still sparse, according to an analyst.The Air Force has put the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts have estimated the cost at up to $80 billion, but the Pentagon has been reluctant to be specific to prevent its capabilities from being inferred.RBC Capital analyst Robert Stallard suspects that the bomber will hit Northrop's margins but noted ""there is not much Northrop can say to prove or disprove this notion"" due to the classified nature of the B-21.A spokesman for the defense contractor didn't respond to a request for comment.Northrop won the bomber contract in October, beating a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for what is likely to be the biggest program award of the decade. The B-21 will replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s.Stallard also downgraded Northrop's stock to sector perform from outperform, citing the highest stock value relative to earnings in more than 10 years. But he added the long-term outlook for Northrop remains positive due to an improved Defense Department budget and the ramp-up in the B-21 still ahead.Northrop shares closed down 1.4% on the stock market today.The B-21 has already drawn criticism from Capitol Hill. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has major issues with the Air Force's demand for cost secrecy.“Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?” he complained a March 8 hearing.McCain is also critical of the service's use of a cost-plus contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.Meanwhile, Northrop will benefit from another aircraft program that has taken heavy flak, Lockheed's F-35, which is running over budget and behind schedule.The eventual start of full-rate production on the F-35 should help Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, offset declines on the F/A-18's production, Stallard said. Northrop builds the fuselage and some electronic components, including the mission-planning software.Stallard downgraded Lockheed stock to sector perform, noting high valuation concerns as well.Lockheed has seen an uptick in deliveries of its troublesome F-35 and operating margins should get a boost when production increases, Stallard wrote. The program is seen accounting for 30% of Lockheed sales in 2018, up from 20% of sales in 2015.Lockheed shares slipped 1.1%.

544,LMT,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter will face off against the older A-10 in a series of tests this year, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester said Tuesday amid doubts about the new aircraft's ability to perform close air support as effectively as the Cold War-era bruiser.The two planes will be tested against each other in close air support, search and rescue, and forward air controller missions. The testing office had said previously the match-up would happen in 2018.“We’re going to do it under all the circumstances that we see CAS [close air support] conducted, including under high-threat conditions in which we expect F-35 will have an advantage, and other conditions requiring loitering on the target, low-altitude operations and so forth,” said Michael Gilmore, director of operational test and evaluation at the Pentagon, at a Senate hearing Tuesday, according to Stars and Stripes.Lockheed shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today.The Air Force had been looking to retire the A-10 line to save money, but supporters in the military and in Congress have sought to keep it in service longer, saying the F-35 isn't as heavily armored, has less payload capacity and can't orbit above battlefields for as long as the venerated ""Warthog"" can.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry proposed changes to the defense bill that would prevent the Air Force from retiring the A-10 until the tests between the two planes are compete, according to Defense News.But service officials maintain that the aircraft shouldn't be compared on a one-for-one basis, noting that the F-35's stealth would also allow it to operate in more areas.Last year, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh said any tests between the two planes would be a “silly exercise,"" and F-35 program manager Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan said the Air Force needs to test what it “intends the F-35 to do — not the mission that the Air Force intends the F-35 to do looking like the A-10.”

549,LMT,"Just because you're looking at a nice base structure, doesn't mean you can't look at getting a nice dividend too.Paychex (PAYX) has been forming a shallow cup base for the last three months. The weekly chart shows some volume spikes on the downside and lower volume on the right-hand side of its base. However, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B and the up/down volume has improved to 1.0 in the last few weeks. The stock only gave up 16% and held fairly tight at its lows, refusing to give up more ground.The company gets the bulk of its revenue from providing payroll services to small- and medium-sized businesses. With fewer employees, smaller businesses often find it more cost-effective to outsource their payroll and other human resource functions. Paychex has a steady three-year annual earnings growth rate of 8% with an Earnings Stability Factor of 1, where the lower number reflects less volatility in earnings. They have an excellent Composite Rating of 96 with stellar return-on-equity of 38%, no debt, and a dividend yield of 3.2%.Lockheed Martin (LMT) is forming a base that is even more shallow with a depth of 12%, qualifying it as a flat base. Two glaring negatives: the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a D and the up/down volume is at 0.7. The defense company gets 78% of its revenue from the U.S. government, and could benefit from a budget compromise in October that increased the Pentagon's budget over the next two years.The dividend yield for Lockheed Martin is 3.0% and the dividend growth rate is 19%, a big plus for income investors. The company has reported steady growth in earnings with a three-year annual growth rate of 11% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 3.Target (TGT) just reported earnings this week and rose despite missing estimates. That puts the stock firmly on the right-hand side of a 35-week consolidation.

551,LMT,"The fight against the Islamic State and other tensions in the Middle East are taking a backseat to lower oil prices as defense spending in the region is seen flattening.Defense spending in the Middle East is expected to stay at roughly $170 billion for the next two years, according to a report from Craig Caffrey, principal analyst at IHS Jane’s, on Sunday.Defense spending had been on the uptick between 2012 and 2014. Even as oil prices sank in 2015, Saudi Arabia placed a $2 billion order for the Patriot air-defense system from Raytheon (RTN).But now oil prices are down nearly 70% from June 2014. On Monday, Brent crude settled up 5.1% at $34.69 a barrel. U.S. crude jumped 6.2% to $31.48.Last year saw the region's first defense budget cuts in a decade, Bloomberg cited the Jane's report as saying.""We saw the first marginal cuts in 2015, but those cuts are now expected to deepen in 2016 as states are forced into pursuing fiscal consolidation with more vigor,"" Caffrey was quoted as saying.Saudi Arabia's defense spending fell 6.8% in 2015 vs. 2014 to $46.3 billion, even as it fought rebels in Yemen. Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the drop in oil wouldn't affect the nation's military readiness.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's main rival, Iran, raised its defense budget by 29% last year. Tunisia and Israel had the other fastest-growing defense budgets in the region.Last month, Lockheed Martin (LMT) started building Israel’s first F-35 “Adir” fighter jet. Israel plans to buy 33 F-35A jets to replace its F-15s and F-16s.Still, heightened regional tensions should continue to prop up defense budgets, Caffrey reportedly said. ""As the Gulf States take a more active role in regional security, we will likely see upward pressure on defense budgets in the medium to long term.""U.S. defense contractors are banking on Middle Eastern sales. Boeing (BA) opened an office in Qatar in 2011, and Lockheed opened an office there last year as it tries to boost foreign revenue.And as recently as last month, they remained upbeat on the Mideast. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said that plunging oil prices hadn’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Also, Raytheon said overseas sales accounted for 31% of total sales last year and that the company hasn’t seen a decline in orders from oil-dependent customers.Raytheon shares climbed 1% to 124.76 in the stock market today. Lockheed shares rose 0.8%. Boeing shares jumped 2.2%.Meanwhile, China has doubled its arms exports in the last five years, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, although the U.S. and Russia still remain the world's top weapons exporters.

552,LMT,"ARLINGTON, VA. -- The Pentagon must mitigate key software issues in Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 by late spring, or else the Air Force might have to delay declaring its variant combat-ready.The plane needs to be rebooted once every four flight hours, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program's executive officer, said at a briefing late Wednesday. ""Not a good metric.""The team is working to bring it to once every eight or nine hours, as on legacy planes. He added that the F-35 is ""a lot better"" than where Lockheed's earlier stealth fighter -- the F-22 -- was in its early days.Of particular concern is how the software in the F-35's sensors work with the main computer. If it isn't improved by the end of May, the Air Force might have to push back the Aug. 1 target date for the F-35A's initial operating capability (IOC).""If you don’t get that right, the system just clogs,"" Bogdan said.The service has a window of August to December to declare the F-35 combat-ready, but Bogdan said that Aug. 1 was the only date in his mind.Another critical issue is the F-35's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues and has been described as the fighter's ""brains.""""We are adding significant capability to ALIS, at the same time trying to fix many of the things we didn't fix when were trying to first deploy it,"" Bogdan said. ""Hard to do together.""A report from the Pentagon's chief weapons tester had mentioned the software and ALIS issues, and also noted the risk of smaller pilots getting seriously injured if they try ejecting from the plane.But Bogdan said that the report's calculation -- that pilots lighter than 136 pounds have a 25% chance of dying when ejecting -- was misleading and that the probability of any one pilot flying the F-35, ejecting and getting hurt is actually 1 in 50,000. Still, pilots below 136 pounds are restricted from flying the F-35.Lockheed is working on a delay to the ejection system of a few milliseconds to slow down the seat for lightweight pilots. Rockwell Collins (COL) is also working on building a helmet that weighs 4.6 pounds, down from 5.1 pounds.But the helmet's development is lagging behind seat development by eight or nine months and won't be fixed until next year, so the restrictions on lightweight pilots won't be lifted until then. For now, only one pilot is affected and has been moved to train on the F-22.Lockheed shares were down 3.2% in the stock market today. Rockwell Collins fell 1.6%.

553,LMT,"Boeing (BA) said it will mull its ""next steps"" after the government rejected the company's protest over the long-range strike bomber contract, which was awarded to Northrop Grumman (NOC) last fall.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said Tuesday it found ""no basis"" to sustain or uphold the challenge.""In denying Boeing’s protest, GAO concluded that the technical evaluation, and the evaluation of costs, was reasonable, consistent, and in accordance with procurement laws and regulations,"" according to a statement.Boeing said in a statement that it still believes its bid was the best solution, adding ""We will carefully review the GAO's decision and decide upon our next steps with regard to the protest in the coming days.""Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS, said Boeing could still go to court, noting that Lockheed Martin (LMT) sued the Pentagon in December to stop work on the $6.75 billion joint light tactical vehicle contract that was awarded to Oshkosh (OSK).Because of the secretive nature of the bomber program, the details of Boeing's protest and the GAO's reasons for denying it are classified and won't be disclosed to the public.Northrop won the bomber deal in October, but Boeing and teammate Lockheed Martingissued a formal protest soon after, saying the Air Force’s decision was “fundamentally flawed.”The Air Force has plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, in a contract that could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion, to replace the decades-old Boeing B-52 bombers.Northrop shares rallied 1.6% in the stock market today. Boeing shares climbed 3.65%. Lockheed shares rose 1.4%.Prospects for the protest got a new twist last week, when the Air Force announced that Richard Lombardi, the Air Force’s principal deputy assistant secretary for acquisition, previously hadn’t listed his wife’s Northrop retirement account in his annual financial disclosure form.But Air Force Secretary Deborah James said Friday that ""my staff has also reviewed all the information and documentation and tells me that Mr. Lombardi was certainly not part of the source selection -- was not an SAE (service acquisition executive) at the time this happened.”Northrop had to stop work on the bomber until after the ruling on Boeing’s protest. In a statement Tuesday, the company said it will get back to work on the aircraft.

555,LMT,"Congress wants to know how much it would cost to restart production on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 Raptor, nearly five years after production ended prematurely, amid doubts about the F-35's ability to out-fly other planes.The House Armed Services Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee issued a legislative directive as part of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Bill Tuesday that would require the Air Force to conduct a cost assessment.The F-22 program was canceled in 2009 with only 187 operational planes -- less than half of the 381 the Air Force requested -- as costs soared. The Air Force has maintained that restarting the program would be too expensive.A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building just 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion-$17.4 billion in 2008 dollars, depending on a variety of factors. Lockheed did not respond to requests for comment.The committee wants a report no later than Jan. 1 on estimated costs and the time it would need to achieve low-rate production to build another 194 jets to meet the original target of 381. The Air Force would also look at opportunities for foreign export and partner nation involvement.Lockheed shares closed virtually unchanged at 226.58 in the stock market today.""In light of growing threats to U.S. air superiority as a result of adversaries closing the technology gap and increasing demand from allies and partners for high performance, multi-role aircraft to meet evolving and worsening global security threats, the committee believes that such proposals are worthy of further exploration,"" the committee wrote.The F-22 had been designated primarily as an air superiority fighter, while Lockheed's F-35, which will have three versions for the Air Force, Navy and Marines, is seen as a multi-role fighter.But the Pentagon has also touted the abilities of the over-budget and behind-schedule F-35. Production is expected to hit 2,443 for the U.S. services and program costs are running at $400 billion.“Nothing compares to it. I’d put this airplane up against any airplane in the world today, tomorrow and for the next 20 or 30 years and we will come out ahead,” Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, F-35 program manager, said to Aviation Week in September.But some members of Congress are still concerned about the F-35, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. And a media report out last year found the plane's dogfighting abilities against an older F-16 were lacking.Meanwhile, other countries are enhancing their arsenals. China has been developing the J-31 fighter, which is believed to be made from stolen F-35 plans, and a new long-range air-to-air missile. Russia also has been expanding its radar and weapons capabilities.
"
556,LMT,"Nike (NKE) has more U.S. patents than a defense contractor making stealth jets, a pharma developing cancer-fighting drugs, and an auto giant working on self-driving cars.The athletic gear maker was granted about 500 patents last year and ended 2015 with 5,060 issued patents, which include those that expired, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). That tops Lockheed Martin (LMT) (4,113), Ford Motor (F) (3,563) and Pfizer (PFE) (2,587). And that doesn’t even include patent applications.Nike’s patents have nearly doubled since 2009, and CEO Mark Parker boasted last year the company has the third-largest U.S. portfolio of design patents. Nike has buried rivals Adidas and Under Armour (UA) in patents, as it looks to maintain its dominance with an avalanche of innovations in manufacturing and design while potentially toying with a wearable device that could appear alongside Apple's (AAPL) smartwatches and Fitbit's (FIT) trackers.""Generally, you should see some type of correlation when a company is releasing innovative, game-changing products,” said Envision IP Managing Attorney Maulin Shah, who said that of Nike’s thousands of granted patents, over 4,200 of them are still active and in force.As Nike doubles down on automation and 3D printing capabilities, a recent Macquarie analysis of the USPTO library observed “a meaningful acceleration of (Nike) patents in recent months focusing on new ways to manufacture products.”Nike already has its own army of shoe-painting and water-free dyeing robots, just to name a few. And in October, it announced a partnership with Flextronics (FLEX), a manufacturer that has developed an automated way to cut material waste by 50%. Such savings, if flowed to the bottom line, could add 23 cents to Nike's 2016 earnings per share, Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu estimated in April.Separately, Nike is building a “3D digital design system” in partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) that includes “nearly instantaneous digital print applications, photo-real 3D visualizations and ultra-rapid prototyping.”Compared to Nike's more than 4,200 active patents, German rival Adidas has “kind of been stagnant,” with a U.S. patent portfolio that is about a ninth the size of Nike’s, not including those gained in its acquisition of golf equipment maker TaylorMade, said Shah. But Adidas does have a “relatively large” patent portfolio in Europe, he noted. Globally, Nike has about 19,500 patents and patent applications vs. Adidas’ roughly 2,400.Under Armour, which has been happy to be framed as a tech company with a penchant for snapping up fitness apps, only has about 104 issued U.S. patents, almost two-thirds of which are design and not utility patents, by Shah's count. Utility patents in athletic apparel primarily deal with material -- think compression, moisture-wicking -- and manufacturing methods vs. patents for clothing designs.Innovation aside, patents can also be an indicator for something far juicier: a peek into a company’s product strategy.For example, Under Armour was granted on March 29 a patent for a one-armed compression sleeve designed to warm a pitcher’s throwing arm between innings -- an interestingly specific item that indicated potential future investments in baseball. Indeed, a few weeks later, the company signed Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP, to what ESPN said is the biggest endorsement deal ever for a baseball player, though terms weren't disclosed.Source: USPTOWhile most of Nike's recent patent activity is related to manufacturing, a dive into its sprawling portfolio indicates a potential shift in its device strategy.Nike hasn’t been in the wearables business since axing most of its FuelBand team two years ago, and the TomTom-powered Nike+ Sportwatch is no more. Nike instead has been pushing its revamped Nike+ app over any hardware.Some have said the athletic apparel giant is shying away from hardware development because of its partnership with Apple, particularly since its Nike+ app can be used on the Apple Watch. But its patents say otherwise.There has been a ""surge"" in wearable-related applications from Nike in the last two or three years, Shah said, and the company now has 261 active patents related to wearable tech vs. Adidas' 99 and Under Armour's dozen patents.Published with the USPTO recently, images from a patent for an “athletic watch” look an awful lot like the TomTom version of Nike’s watch: a boxy-looking accessory with a perforated band and large numbers. In fact, given the slight aesthetic differences -- an extra button here, a missing button there, a thinner wristband -- the drawings could easily be a newer edition of the Nike+ SportWatch, though it is not clear if that is the case.Both Nike and TomTom did not immediately respond to a request for comment..Source: USPTO“It definitely seems that Nike is keeping its options open on this front,” Macquarie's Vasilescu told IBD after viewing an earlier trio of patent applications for an athletic watch that were published on March 17 and first filed last September.Meanwhile, about 20% of Adidas’ patents are focused on wearables. But such products may never come to market, Shah said, noting that companies also license ideas if they aren't in a position to make gadgets themselves.Given the sheer number of applications that are filed with the USPTO each year – 629,647 in 2015 alone – some might consider it folly to think digging through musty government archives might shed any light on what kind of consumer products could hit shelves.Indeed, trying to decipher a company’s product pipeline by looking at the U.S. patent library is a little bit like astronomy -- both constellations and published patents are maps of the past. Starlight has to travel so far to reach Earth that some of those celestial bodies that appear to be burning in the night sky may already be dead, or dying.Similarly, it takes about 24.6 months on average for filed patent applications to be published on the USPTO database, according to the agency. Most are actually published within a year and a half, Santa Clara University School of Law Assistant Professor Brian Love told IBD, though ideas were conceived and worked on well before a filing.“It’s probably at least two years old, if not more, and then by the time the patent issues, you’re talking about tacking on a couple more years on top of that,"" he said. ""So it is kind of a window into the future, but it’s not that far of a window into the future.”Still, filings can offer clues years in advance. Case in point: Nike rolled out self-lacing Marty McFly-inspired shoes in March, after Nike designer Tinker Hatfield confirmed in early 2014 that power lacing would be unveiled the following year. But the company's “Back to the Future” resurrection could've been foreseen long before that. Nike's first granted patent for an “automatic lacing system” appeared in 2011.Of course, some companies stake out IP turf not for the purpose of developing those ideas, but to thwart competitors’ dreams. This type of defensive patent publishing, as it is known, is not uncommon with tech giants like IBM (IBM) or Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, say experts.“The consequence of publishing something is that you lose any sort of trade secrets rights you might have in it, but you’re also stopping somebody else from patenting it,” said Love.Watchmaker Swatch has reportedly been on a smartwatch-patent filing spree over the last few years. What it intends to do with them is a mystery.“There’s a lot of rumors in the patent industry: Will Swatch start suing competitors, or are they actually just building up patents because they’re about to launch an entirely new product line?” said Shah.Regardless, no matter what Nike, Under Armour or Adidas wind up bringing to market, all of this patent-filing and R&D means that investors and consumers can likely expect growth from the activewear space.“I think we are in the golden age of tech in the athletic footwear business,” said NPD Group analyst Matt Powell. “I have never seen so many new tech advances (in products and manufacturing) that we are currently seeing. So add that to the fact that there’s a record number of patents and the future looks really bright.”

560,LMT,"The major U.S. stock indexes have come under renewed selling pressure this week, as top stocks including Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) take big knocks.Tread carefully as you seek to invest in ETFs in an unsteady market, but don't stop looking for ideas.Two exchange traded funds nearing buy points on the stock market today have held up better in the past month than the bellwether SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Each holds stocks that will take your portfolio skyward, in the literal if not metaphorical sense.First up is iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA), up 3.2% in the month ended May 17 vs. a 1.4% loss for SPY. As Russia and China posture aggressively, global tensions are ratcheting up. That could mean heady times are in store for defense stocks.ITA is trading 2% below a buy point of 125.95, off an extended saucer base.Its 37 stock holdings include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). They're generally manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft, as well as other defense equipment.The ETF has $690.9 million in assets and a 0.43% expense ratio.Trading volume is decent, at roughly 64,000 shares a day.ITA's Relative Strength line is rapidly climbing, which makes it a good candidate for a stock watch list. The RS line measures how a stock is performing vs. the S&P 500 index.In another technically bullish sign, this ETF has been riding an air cushion above its 50-day moving average since late February. By comparison, SPY has chopped around that key line of strength this month.ITA saw $41.2 million in net outflow over the first four months of 2016, but sentiment could be turning around. The weekly chart shows heavy buying on the right side of the flat base, which means institutional interest is stepping up.The last time ITA broke out of a base, in October 2014, it ran up roughly 10% in a matter of four months.Not every breakout from a basing pattern is successful, but buying on breakouts helps increase the odds of a successful advance.First Trust ISE Cloud Computing (SKYY) broke out of a flat base in November but sank hard soon thereafter. However, after a July 2013 breakout, this exchange traded fund ran up nearly 30% over the following eight months.It's now within 1% of another potential breakout from a first-stage cup-with-handle base, with a 30.05 buy point. Look for the ETF to move up through the handle’s high on heavier-than-normal volume.SKYY also boasts decent volume, at approximately 83,000 shares a day. The ETF holds $517.4 million in assets and has a 0.60% expense ratio.Its 34-stock portfolio includes IBD Leaderboard stocks Facebook (FB) and Amazon.The technical picture holds some cautionary signs. Volume is weak on the right side of the consolidation. Potential buyers need to consider SKYY's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D. That rating indicates heavy institutional selling in recent weeks.The RS Rating of 61 is underwhelming too.ITA has produced a 16.6% annual average gain over the past three years.SKYY gained an annual average 10.1% in that period, and SPY rose 9.2%.

564,LMT,"Three exchange traded funds that specialize in dividend stocks are tracing bullish patterns on their charts. Moreover, they seldom drop more than 15%.Slow and tight price activity characterizes this trio of ETFs, reflecting the quieter nature of stocks that tend to belong to mature companies whose dividends appeal more to investors than share appreciation.For investors content with dividends and moderate price appreciation rather than the immediate satisfaction of a price rally, the three funds -- all part of IBD's ETF Leaders screen -- are sound choices. But there's a trade-off with the low volatility of dividend ETFs because price performance is dull.PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio's (PEY) worst drop since the 2009 market bottom was a 19% correction in May 2010. (That excludes the Aug. 24 market mini-crash.)The fund's dividends produce an annualized yield of about 3%. In the latest monthly payout, investors got about 3.5 cents a share. The ETF is up about 13% this year, but it declined 12% in a November-January correction.The Dividend Achievers fund tracks a portfolio of stocks with solid dividends and dividend growth rates. The ETF is close to new highs after finding support at the 10-week moving average, despite the fact that some of its top holdings are oil companies that have been battered lately. Murphy Oil (MUR), the largest component, is about 30% below a 52-week high.As its name implies, the mission of PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) is not just to tap dividend companies, but also stocks with historically subdued price performance. Its steepest decline since the fund launched in 2012 was 10% in 2014. Shares are finding support at their 50-day moving average.The ETF's annualized yield is about 3%. Shareholders were paid about 11.5 cents a share at the end of April. The bulk of the portfolio is in financial, utility and industrial companies.IShares Select Dividend (DVY), which is also rising slowly from its 50-day average, had a couple of 18% declines in 2010 and 2011, but the worst drop since then was a 9% correction in 2014. Shares are near highs as they test the 50-day line. Shareholders are paid dividends on a quarterly basis. In March, they got a little over 63 cents a share.IShares Select Dividend tracks a Dow Jones index of 100 of the highest-dividend-yielding securities, excluding real estate investment trusts. Top holdings include Lockheed Martin (LMT), CME Group (CME), Chevron (CVX) and Philip Morris (PM).The comfort of steady performance, however, was nowhere to be found on Aug. 24, when machinations in electronic trading resulted in a mini crash for most stocks. PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend collapsed as much as 38% before paring most of the loss. IShares Select Dividend crashed 35.5%, and PowerShares High Yield plummeted 29% before both erased most of those huge losses.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

568,LMT,"Apple (AAPL), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Reynolds American (RAI), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Twitter (TWTR) report Tuesday. Here's what you need to know:The iPhone maker, which reports after the close on Tuesday, is expected to log a 14% per-share profit decline to $2 on a 10% revenue fall to $51.97 billion. Just how much iPhone sales will tumble from last year is on investors' minds ahead of the earnings report, with consensus at sales of 50 million units vs. the prior year's Q2 sales of 61.17 million iPhone units.Apple shares dipped 0.6% Monday but remain slightly above their 50-day line after losing support at the 200-day level on April 15.The first defense contractor to report, Lockheed Martin is expected to post a 5.5% decline in per-share earnings and a 12% revenue rise to $11.34 billion. Investors and analysts will closely inspect the performance of Sikorsky, a 2015 acquisition from United Technologies (UTX).Lockheed shares are attempting to break out after building a three-month-wide flat base with a 228.01 entry point. The stock edged down fractionally Monday to 226.30.The tobacco giant's earnings are seen growing 16% to 50 cents a share as revenue is expected to rise 42% to $2.93 billion, the latter of which would mark the third consecutive quarter of more-than-40% sales growth.Reynolds American, a major dividend stock, closed the day up 1.2% to 48.41 but has yet to retake its 50-day line after slicing below that key support level in mid-April.Wall Street sees the social network's profit rising 43% to a dime a share. Revenue is also expected to grow in the double digits, with 39% projected growth to $607.8 million. A slowdown in Twitter user growth over the last four straight quarters has prompted analyst caution.Facebook (FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD) follow on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.Twitter shares fell 0.8% to 17.09 on Monday, closing back below its 200-day moving average.A first-ever quarterly loss is expected of the beleaguered fast-casual chain, as analysts broadly predict a 95-cent per-share loss, slightly better than Chipotle Mexican Grill's prior guidance for a $1 ""or worse"" per-share loss but a wild swing from last year's $3.88 in per-share profit.Analysts anticipate a 19% revenue drop to $880.2 million.A big question is how quickly Chipotle is winning back its legions of fans. Chipotle's guidance will be especially critical.Shares gained 0.1%, ending Monday at 443.10.Fast-casual peer Panera Bread (PNRA) and sports bar chain Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) also are set to report earnings late Tuesday.RELATED:How Much Will iPhone Sales Fall In Apple’s March Quarter?Will Twitter Show A Reversal In User Declines With Q1 Earnings?Here’s What To Expect From Chipotle EarningsWhat To Expect When Lockheed Martin Kicks Off Defense Earnings

569,LMT,"Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) first-quarter revenue is seen rising, but international sales could take a hit on lower oil prices, and its new Sikorsky helicopter division may underperform.On Tuesday, the maker of the F-35 and F-16 fighter jets kicks off a busy week for defense contractors, with Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also on tap. Boeing (BA), which has substantial defense operations, reports Wednesday.Analysts see Lockheed reporting a 5.5% drop in EPS to $2.59, following a 5% drop in Q4. Revenue is seen rising 12.4% to $11.36 billion, helped by recent acquisitions.All eyes will be on the Sikorsky unit that Lockheed bought from United Technologies (UTX) last year. In a February SEC filing, Lockheed said that the business ""may underperform relative to our expectations” and that demand for helicopters and other products from the unit could be “adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of its control.”At Lockheed's annual media day in March, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that the company is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices. In the Q4 earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Lockheed may also give an update on the progress of getting a deal with the Pentagon on lots nine and ten for the F-35.On Friday, a Lockheed spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company would lay off ""less than 200"" workers in its IT division. The cuts come after the company said in November that it would lay off 500 employees as it divests the unit as part of its deal with Leidos (LDOS) to focus on its aircraft and weapons units.Lockheed shares rose fractionally on the stock market Friday, up 0.3% to 226.81. The stock has been moving sideways for the past two weeks, less than 1% below a 228.01 buy point in a consolidation going back to late November.Northrop Grumman results are on tap for Wednesday. The Global Hawk maker’s EPS is seen climbing 3.3% to $2.49, but revenue is expected to dip 0.5% to $5.93 billion. Congress is pushing the Pentagon to buy even more of Northrop’s B-21 bombers. Northrop Grumman shares broke to a new high in weak volume late last month but remain in buy range.General Dynamics will also announce results Wednesday. Analysts see EPS edged up 0.9% to $1.26 and revenue down 1.2% to $7.69 billion. General Dynamics stock rose fractionally Friday but has been trading below its 200-day line since early December.Raytheon rounds out the week on Thursday.  Analysts expect the maker of the Tomahawk cruise missile to report a 23% drop in EPS to $1.38 but revenue is seen climbing 3.2% to $5.46 billion. Shares are trading about 3% below their Dec. 17 peak of 129.99.

570,LMT,"North Korea's reported launch of a long-range rocket could lead key U.S. allies in the region to deploy an advanced missile-defense system from Lockheed Martin (LMT). On Sunday, North Korea said it put a satellite into orbit on its rocket Kwangmyongsong. South Korea, Japan, the U.S., and other allies see it as a test of long-range missile technology. After the…

571,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- The Government Accountability Office is expected to rule soon on a dispute over the Pentagon's award of the long-range bomber contract to Northrop Grumman (NOC), but a recent financial disclosure by an Air Force acquisition official could delay that.A Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team that lost the bid had filed a protest soon after Northrop won the contract last fall.But Boeing could amend its protest to include Richard Lombardi, the Air Force's principal deputy assistant secretary for acquisition, who previously hadn't listed his wife's Northrop retirement account in his annual financial disclosure form.A Boeing spokesperson said the company has no comment at this time.On Thursday, the Air Force said it reassigned Lombardi to another position to help wounded veterans.At an Air Force Association breakfast Friday, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said she is ""really not able to answer"" questions about whether Boeing would alter its protest with the information.James was notified of the Lombardi's disclosure on Feb.3, reassigned him Feb. 4 and referred the issue to the Pentagon's inspector general.""It's in the hands of the (inspector general), so this will all be thoroughly reviewed,"" she said. ""My staff has also reviewed all the information and documentation and tells me that Mr. Lombardi was certainly not part of the source selection -- was not an SAE (service acquisition executive) at the time this happened.""Northrop won the bomber award in October, but the Boeing team issued a formal protest, saying the Air Force’s decision was “fundamentally flawed.” Due to the secretive nature of the program, details as to exactly why Northrop won the award won’t be released to the public.Northrop had to stop work on the bomber until after the ruling on Boeing's protest.The Air Force has plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, in a contract that could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion, to replace the decades-old Boeing B-52 bombers.Boeing shares were up 0.2% in the stock market today. Lockheed shares dipped 0.5%, and Northrop shares were down 1.45%.

572,LMT,"The F-35 needs to pass new tests at a base in Idaho later this month for it to stay on track toward being combat ready for the Air Force by August.The Air Force is sending its version of the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 to Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwestern Idaho from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, according to Maj. Gen. Jay Silveria in a Reuters report.The test will determine if the next-generation stealth fighter can be deployed to different locations for repair and maintenance.""What we’re trying to do is exercise the deployment concepts and to learn from maintenance and learn from (operations),"" Silveria told Reuters.So far, the jet has passed recent tests of sharing data with older jets, along with other F-35s.The Marine Corps declared its version of the F-35 combat ready in July and has plans to deploy it to Japan in 2017. The Air Force plans to declare ""initial operational capability"" between August and December.The F-35 contract was awarded to Lockheed in 2001, and the first planes were expected to be operational by 2010. But there have been issues with the plane’s development over the year, including in its maintenance systems.Earlier this week, a report from the Pentagon’s Operational Test & Evaluation office found that ground crews continued to need “extensive” help from Lockheed’s tech support.And while some problems with the “brains” of the aircraft -- the Autonomic Logistics Information System -- have been fixed with the latest software updates, “many critical deficiencies remain which require maintenance personnel to implement workarounds to address the unresolved problems,” it added.

573,LMT,"Issues with the helmet and ejection seat for lighter-weight pilots are also under scrutiny. And in 2014, a problem with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caused a plane to catch on fire.Lockheed shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today. United Technologies shares dipped 0.3%.The Air Force had hoped the F-35 would replace the well-armed and heavily armored A-10 Warthog for close air support, but reports say a new plan to delay the plane’s retirement will be outlined in the Pentagon’s 2017 budget request to Congress.In tests set for 2018, the military will compare and contrast the F-35’s abilities against those of the A-10.
"
574,LMT,"The Pentagon is requesting more money in the fiscal 2017 budget to fight the Islamic State and address rising tensions with Russia and China, meaning less money to spend on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) new F-35 stealth fighters, so that older planes like the A-10 will stay in service longer.The Defense Department asked for $582.7 billion in military funding, with $523.9 billion in base budget funding and $58.8 billion in overseas contingency operations funding.The main military request is up 0.4% from the 2016 budget of $580.3 billion, but weapons procurement is 6% lower, while research and development spending is 4% higher.The request for anti-Islamic State efforts got a 50% hike to $7.5 billion, and the European Reassurance Initiative, which provides military support to Europe, would rise by $800 million to $3.4 billion.The Air Force would get $166.9 billion, up from $161 billion last year, and would delay retiring the A-10 for least two more years to focus on fighting the Islamic State. The service deferred five F-35A aircraft in the request.The budget includes requests for 63 total F-35s, 70 in 2018 and 80 in 2019, but the major boost in orders won't come until 105 are ordered in 2021.Despite the bump in spending, the Air Force doesn't think it has the funds for long-term threats.""Budget uncertainty has complicated our ability to execute this long-term plan,"" the Air Force said on its budget webpage, leaked ahead of the official budget release according to a Breaking Defense report.""The Air Force is facing a modernization bow wave in critical nuclear and space programs over the next 10 years that, under current funding levels, we simply cannot afford,"" it said.Lockheed shares closed up 0.7% in the stock market today.The budget also included $1.4 billion for the development of the long-range strike bomber. Boeing (BA) and teammate Lockheed are formally protesting the Air Force’s decision to award the long-range strike bomber contract to Northrop Grumman (NOC). A decision is expected later this month.Boeing shares lost 0.5%. Northrop shares improved by 0.9%.The budget proposal also includes $3.1 billion for 15 Boeing KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers.The Navy's budget, meanwhile, will fall to $164.9 billion from $168.8 billion and will include $89 million to start a drone program, which has changed focus to refueling and surveillance vs. major strike capability.The Army's funding will increase to $148 billion from $146.9 billion.Looking ahead, the Pentagon is mapping out a 2018 budget of $556.7 billion, $564.8 billion in 2019, $570.4 billion in 2020, $585.2 billion in 2021.
"
575,LMT,"The Pentagon's chief weapons tester said Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter still has important bugs to be fixed and raised doubts about pursuing a bulk purchase for hundreds of jets.Defense acquisition officials hope a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes can cut costs for the $400 billion program. It is also a bigger driver for Lockheed, which received $1.4 billion last year for F-35 production contracts.But a report from the Pentagon’s Operational Test & Evaluation office said a block buy could mean large batches of faulty planes enter service that will need several expensive fixes, resulting in no net cost savings.""The department should carefully consider whether committing to a 'block buy,' composed of three lots of aircraft, is prudent given the state of maturity of the program,"" according to the report, which was released Monday.The Pentagon plans to buy nearly 2,500 F-35s to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8B Harriers.The F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines last year, and the Air Force is expected to declare its variant of the jet ready by the end of this year. But the plane continues to be plagued with problems.The report reiterated problems with Block 2B version of the software in the Marines' F-35B, including problems with electronic warfare, ""weapons employment in ambiguous threat displays,"" and reliance on off-board sources for accurate coordinates for precision attack, among other issues.Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35's program manager, told Defense One the Marine F-35s have the necessary weapons for close air support, air interdiction and ""limited suppression/destruction of enemy air defense missions.""Bogdan said that Monday's report doesn't fully address all the efforts to fix the technical and schedule problems.Some of the prior problems with the ""brains"" of the aircraft, the Autonomic Logistics Information System, have been fixed with the latest software updates, but the report said ""many critical deficiencies remain which require maintenance personnel to implement workarounds to address the unresolved problems.""Among other issues, smaller pilots could be seriously injured if they try ejecting from the plane. Pilots that weigh less than 136 pounds are restricted from flying the jet. Pilots between 137 and 165 pounds have a 25% chance of dying and a 100% chance of a serious neck injury if they eject, according to the report.Ground crews continued to need ""extensive"" help from Lockheed's tech support, the report added. Other issues include failure of the maintenance management system to identify what parts need to be replaced, as well as any damage caused by exceeding certain speeds.Lockheed shares closed up 1.2% in the stock market today. Boeing, whose F/A-18E/F Super Hornet often competes against the F-35 for foreign buyers, added 3.7%.

576,LMT," Boeing (BA) will finally be able to sell fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait as the White House is near signing off on the long-awaited deals, according to a Reuters report.The Pentagon and State Department have already approved the orders of 36 F-15s to Qatar and 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to Kuwait. The deals are valued at $4 billion and $3 billion, respectively, sources told Reuters.Boeing shares closed up 0.5% in midday trading in the stock market today.The deals had been held up, as the Obama administration was concerned they didn't fit into its defense strategy in the region, and Israel was worried  about the weapons falling into the wrong hands.The sales would help extend production of the fourth-generation jets. Right now, the F-15 line is expected to end in 2019 after completing an order for Saudi Arabia. Production on the Super Hornet is slated to end by 2018.Defense spending in the Gulf has increased as tensions with Iran have heated up. The U.S. also has used weapons sales to the region to help alleviate some fears among allies after the Iranian nuclear deal.Last year, Saudi Arabia went on a buying spree, picking up Patriot air-defense systems from Raytheon (RTN) and Sikorsky MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters.The UAE is reportedly in the market for a fighter jet but is waiting for the Pentagon to approve sales of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Lockheed shares dipped 0.3% Tuesday, and Raytheon lost less than 0.1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

577,LMT,"Headlines haven't been kind to Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. ""America's Most Expensive Fighter Jet is Also Its Worst,"" Maxim wrote. ""Report: The F-35’s Pilot Eject System Could KILL You And Definitely Will Maim You,"" according to the Daily Caller. ""The Pentagon's Official F-35 Bug List is Terrifying,"" said ExtremeTech.Government reports of the $400 billion program have also been scathing. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain is a major critic, and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said he'd consider dropping the program if he gets elected.But a Marine pilot who has been flying the F-35 for nearly four years feels differently, even if some bugs still need to be worked out.""I love the airplane, and it's great to be flying something that's newer,"" Maj. Brendan Walsh told IBD.He previously flew F/A-18C Hornets, which debuted in the 1980s, but he's now flying a so-called fifth-generation fighter with stealth technology.""Even in today's battlefield and even with what some people call immaturities on the F-35, I would hands down rather be in an F-35 than an F-18 in just about any situation,"" Walsh said.The Marine Corps declared the F-35B variant combat ready in July, and Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121, the ""Green Knights,"" became the first squadron to become operational with an F-35.Since then, the Marines have been preparing for the F-35's first deployment to Iwakuni, Japan, next year.A short, expeditionary runway comprised of metal sheets was used at a Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, Calif., to practice short take-offs and vertical landings (STOVL).""The STOVL is awesome,"" said Walsh, who is the operations officer for the Green Knights. ""We can deploy fifth-generation platforms in decentralized areas that make it hard for the enemy to target.""The F-35 has come a long way since Walsh started flying it four years ago. For example, it now takes Walsh eight minutes to hit the runway for take-off, comparable to the F/A-18, and down from two hours when he first started flying the new jet.He is also impressed with the F-35's stealth, among other features, and is confident that even more advanced capabilities will come later.""The radar has performed well, the surveillance systems and electronic surveillance systems have performed very well, even in this configuration of the airplane, and they are only going to get better,"" Walsh said.But while Walsh prefers the F-35 over his old jet, a dogfight in the new aircraft could be problematic.Last year, the military blog War Is Boring reported that an older General Dynamics (GD) F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn’t equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display or compete stealth coatings. It also is trying to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, Lockheed's F-22 Raptor, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.The F-35, which will have three versions for the Air Force, Navy and Marines, is seen as a multirole fighter, with production expected to hit 2,443 for the U.S. services and more than 900 for international customers.Meanwhile, China has been developing the J-31 fighter, which is believed to be made from stolen F-35 plans, and a new long-range air-to-air missile. Russia also has been expanding its radar and weapons capabilities.But given its advanced features, Walsh doesn't see the F-35 doing much turning and burning against other fighters. “If you’re in a dogfight in this airplane, you did something wrong, because you should have killed everyone way before you got there.""Still, he said, there have been “better performances recently” in dogfighting match-ups, based on what he's heard from operational testers, and those tests are still ongoing.Other issues continue to hang over the F-35 program. Last month, at a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said that he has “concerns about where the software was"" and wanted Lockheed to hurry up with fixes.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has pointed out glitches in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues.Walsh's squadron tested the troublesome system, considered the ""brains"" of the F-35, in December, and it set up the complex server in a remote area in Twentynine Palms.""I have full confidence that we can deploy the server and go somewhere if we have to,"" Walsh said. ""I had no issues with it from a pilot's point of view, getting into the system and signing for the aircraft and screening it as appropriate for flight.""An evaluation of the ejection system also found that it's possible lightweight pilots could break their necks while ejecting. A fix is in the works, and Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work recently said he is confident ejection issues with lightweight pilots will be resolved. Also, until a software upgrade next year, the F-35 can't fire its 25 mm cannon.But the evaluation of one warfighter who would fly the F-35 into combat is clear: ""I feel way more survivable and way more lethal in the majority of mission sets in this airplane than with anything the Marine Corps has in the air right now,"" Walsh said.

578,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- The military planned to fly Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter for 300 hours per plane annually but has since scaled back estimates to 250 hours for some services, a Pentagon official said Thursday.That allowed the Defense Department to extend the life of the F-35 by six years to 2070, lifting total life-cycle operating and support costs by $45 billion vs. last year's estimate.Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program executive officer, said at a media briefing that the decision to reduce flight hours wasn't because the services couldn't afford to fly the jet and had ""nothing to do with"" the Air Force delaying the retirement of the A-10.Instead, it was a matter of how the services plan on using the aircraft, though he declined to go into the matter further. Bogdan did note that there have been discussions on using more simulators for training, which could also lower flight hours.""Some of the training has to be done on simulators because of the dense threats seen out there today,"" he said.Bogdan also pointed out that if the F-35's life cycle wasn't extended, overall operating and support costs would have fallen by $22 billion from last year's estimate. ""Every penny we save today turns into a million in 2070.""Maintenance is getting better, and reliability is increasing steadily, he added.The F-35 has been plagued with problems with everything from the engine to the Autonomic Logistics Information System, dubbed the ""brains"" of the plane.Despite the problems, the Pentagon's latest annual report on top weapons programs, which was released to Congress late Thursday, also found that the cost estimate for developing and building the F-35 fleet fell by 3% from the prior estimate to $379 billion in 2014 dollars.That includes savings from a bulk order, or ""block buy."" Bogdan said foreign partners would like to enter a block buy or multiyear deal ""as soon as possible,"" as many already have approval and cash from their governments.Lockheed shares closed down 1.5% at 218 in the stock market today.

579,LMT,"The stock market's rally heated up with an hour to go in Monday's session, the first trading day in May. Volume was running at a slower pace vs. Friday's intense pace.Both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 gained 0.7% to 0.8%, holding near the highs of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average trailed only slightly, up 0.6%. Yield plays outperformed, with the Dow Jones utility average at one point up more than 1.1%.Equally as important, the Nasdaq is finding support at the 50-day moving average, which has been rising for the past six weeks. In strong market uptrends, the major indexes tend to trade north of the 50- and 200-day moving averages, not south.In the stock market today, aerospace firms showed some muscle. L-3 Communications (LLL) gapped up on Monday and rose 1.4% to 133.42, just above a 131.46 buy point within a six-month, saucerlike base pattern. More aggressive traders could have entered the stock when it broke through upside resistance near 121 on April 18. At that time, the stock cleared a trend line that can be drawn from the price high on the left side of the saucer at 131.36.The buy zone runs up to 138.03, 5% above the proper 133.42 entry. Leading stocks should not be chased far beyond the proper buy zone, as temporary pullbacks could shake you out of the stock.

It marked the strongest quarter of EPS growth in at least five years. Revenue shrank for the 11th straight quarter, down 5% vs. a year ago to $2.35 billion.L-3 noted in a news release that all of its businesses contributed to higher operating profit margins. The company also sold its ""National Security Solutions"" business as part of a re-focus on ""higher margin, high-returning businesses,"" CEO Michael Strianese said.L-3 gets a 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, which is respectable in light of the company's attempts to turn around its earnings picture. Earnings fell 4% to $6.91 a share in 2015, but Wall Street sees a 12% pickup for full-year 2016 to $7.71 and an 11% rise in 2017 to $8.54.IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry subgroup, made up of 51 firms, ranks 88th among 197 groups and subgroups in terms of six-month relative price performance and is barely positive for the year.Heico (HEI), featured last week in IBD's New America column, has also formed a long saucer base with a fresh handle, offering a new 62.79 entry. The stock rose 1.5% to  62.23.Did you know that Heico leads F-35 fighter jet maker Lockheed Martin (LMT) in terms of overall stock strength as seen in IBD's Composite Rating. Compare them at IBD Stock Checkup.On the downside, Chinese search engine Baidu (BIDU) sold off hard, falling nearly 8% to 179.26 in huge volume on news that the Chinese government will investigate the Beijing-based firm over the apparent death of a young man who sought to find information at Baidu's flagship site to look for potential treatments for his rare cancer.The stock gave back all of Friday's gains and more following Q1 results, which showed a 16% drop in Q1 profit despite a 19% revenue increase. It marked Baidu's second year-over-year EPS decline in three quarters, while revenue growth slowed for a third quarter in a row. Revenue climbed 38%, 31% and 27% in the prior three periods.

580,LMT,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

583,LMT,"These are turning out to be prosperous times for long-time Pentagon supplier Northrop Grumman.Northrop (NOC) can restart work on its new, potentially lucrative long-range strike bomber, after Boeing’s (BA) protest of the contract’s award was denied last week.Production is increasing for several key programs of which the aerospace giant has been a part, thus ensuring that it has business for several years to come.And while rising tensions with China and Russia may be bad news for international relations, they ultimately could boost demand for other Northrop offerings.""Northrop is a well-balanced company that’s tightly managed and focuses on its niche offerings and (is) not diversified too far outside that,"" said Richard Pettibone, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International.In October, Northrop beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT) to develop the long-range strike bomber, the last major airframe contract expected to be issued by the Pentagon for the next decade.  The Air Force hopes to get funding for 80 to 100 of the new planes.If it passes, the production contract would be worth $50 billion to $80 billion. The planes would replace the Boeing B-52 bombers, which last year entered their seventh decade of service.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said that Northrop’s development bid was the ""best value"" for the nation. Mark Bobbi, a defense analyst at consultancy IHS, said, ""(Northrop) has the best chance of executing on this bomber program than any company in the world""; he estimates that the contract will add $300 million-$400 million to Northrop’s top line this year.There's always a caveat with defense contracts, though. Northrop has yet to win a production deal. And there’s always the chance that the bomber program will be cancelled, particularly if the cost exceeds forecasts of $564 million per aircraft. A previous bomber program was cancelled suddenly in 2009.Due to the deal’s secretive nature, details as to exactly why Northrop won development of the bomber won’t be released to the public. Bobbi speculates that Northrop won because of its legacy with the B-2 stealth bomber and its track record with the E-2D Hawkeye radar aircraft for the Navy. There's also the perception that Northrop's integration, subsystems and supply chain are better than its competitors’.Along with the strike bomber and the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft -- another key contract -- Northrop is a supplier for Lockheed’s F-35 next-generation fighter jets. The ramp-up in production of the F-35 and the extension of Northrop’s F/A-18 Super Hornet combat jet for the Navy and Marine Corps will also help Northrop’s top line this year.On top of all that, the Air Force is expected to make a decision next year about the $10 billion T-X trainer jet program with contract proposals to replace its 500 T-38 jets due in the fourth quarter. Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) all have thrown their hats into the ring. But Pettibone said that it’s unlikely Northrop would win the contract as the Pentagon is expected to consider the industrial base when offering the contract and would want to spread the work out.Still, the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) drone is up for grabs, and the Navy awarded four preliminary design contracts in 2014 to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop. A front runner has yet to emerge on the program.Further, Northrop specializes in next-generation radar, expected to be a priority for the services going forward.Northrop is part of IBD’s Aerospace/Defense group along with peers Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon. It also makes sensors and radar, missile and navigation systems.The company’s total backlog at the end of 2015 was $35.9 billion vs. $38.2 billion at the end of 2014. It got $5.8 billion in new awards in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the company sees full-year EPS of $9.90-$10.20 on sales of $23.5 billion-$24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of $10.49 on sales of $24.47 billion.Northrop says that it sells products and services to customers in 25 nations. But international sales are only roughly 15% of Northrop’s total revenue, as the U.S. services continue to be its main customer. In the 2017 budget request, the Defense Department asked for $582.7 billion in military funding, with $523.9 billion in base budget funding and $58.8 billion in overseas contingency operations funding. The main military request is up 0.4% from the 2016 budget of $580.3 billion.The U.S. defense budget is likely to stay at current levels no matter who wins the 2016 presidential election, Chris Higgins of Morningstar told IBD. He says that the election outcome should have “marginal effects” on defense spending.The risk of sequestration has also been mitigated, and there is little appetite to cut defense anymore, Pettibone says, as hot spots around the world erupt.The fight against terrorism, particularly the Islamic State, isn't as much an advantage to Northrop as it is to Raytheon and Lockheed, since Northrop deals less in precision missile-guidance sales.But Bobbi says that rising tensions with Russia and China will help the company as countries raise their defense budgets. He said that Eastern European nations have raised their defense budgets by a combined 20% in the past year. International sales had been a focal point for defense contractors after domestic sales were curbed during sequestration.Still there are risks for Northrop. For one, there are fewer U.S. contract awards to go around, so the defense industry could be heading towards another round of consolidation like that seen in the 1990s when when Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta, Northrop bought Grumman, and Boeing purchased McDonnell Douglas.Analysts say that a smaller industrial base could actually cut costs, as the current fragmented defense sector creates inefficiencies. But the Pentagon is pushing for more power to block defense mergers and preserve competition. It is asking Congress for a stronger hand when it comes to industry dealmaking.""I think the Defense Department would resist that with its entire essence,"" Bobbi said of the prospect of Boeing buying Northrop. ""You take out another prime contractor and put it under the wing of one that doesn’t have a stellar track record.""Pettibone, however, cautions to ""never say never"" about consolidation. Still, he sees further mergers as unlikely unless government regulators are content with having only two major players left, Boeing and Lockheed.""Northrop will continue to be a constant and conservative player in the defense industry,"" Pettibone said. ""Management has planned for this environment and has the company going in eyes wide open to capitalize on the defense market going forward.""

584,LMT,"Defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT) showed early strength Wednesday in the face of strong market headwinds, although it couldn't hold on to gains.The stock was upgraded by RBC Capital Markets from sector perform to outperform with a price target of 250. The stock trades just below 220.Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak gave a bullish nod to defense stocks, naming Lockheed as one of his top picks for 2016. He thinks they are in the early stages of a cyclical upswing.""Historically, defense budget cycles are always long, and defense stocks almost always outperform far beyond the first year of the spending upturn,"" he said.North Korea's claim to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb this week has also attracted attention to defense stocks.Earlier in the week, the company said it won a $528 million contract from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to produce interceptors for the terminal high-altitude defense system, which aims to destroy incoming missiles inside and outside the atmosphere.Lockheed's early pop on Wednesday moved the stock back above its 50-day moving average, although it couldn't hold the line. It appears to be building a flat base.The chart shows bullish and bearish features. The relative strength line made a new high ahead of the stock, which is positive. But the Accumulation/Distribution Rating was bearish, indicating institutional selling.If the stock does, indeed, build a flat base, the buy point would be 228.01.Lockheed has a history of raising its quarterly dividend, which is now $1.65 a share. That works out to a annualized yield of 3%. As recently as 2012, the quarterly dividend was $1.Earnings growth is slow but steady. The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 10%. Analysts say 2015 earnings will be flat but should grow at a 7% clip in 2016. The Earnings Stability Factor is 3, where low numbers correspond to stable earnings growth.

Sales fell 6.6% to $7.8 billion, worse than forecasts for $8.2 billion. Revenue fell across all segments: aerospace, combat systems, IT and marine systems.General Dynamics sees 2016 revenue of $31.6 billion-$31.8 billion, below consensus for $32.55 billion. It also expects 2016 EPS of $9.20, well below views for $9.52.But management said it will use all free cash flow for share repurchases and dividends, as well as deploying balance sheet cash to supplement buybacks.Shares closed up 1.3% in the stock market today, reversing from an earlier decline of 3.7% but easing from a gain of up to 6.2%.GD, which makes Gulfstream jets, nuclear-powered submarines, tanks and other military equipment, said its total backlog for Q4 fell 8.6%.The results came a day after defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported solid Q4 results but gave a weak profit forecast.Meanwhile, Textron (TXT), known for its Bell helicopters and Cessna and Beechcraft airplanes, said Q4 EPS rose 6.6% to 81 cents, shy of views by 2 cents.Sales slipped 4.2% to $3.9 billion, missing analysts' outlook for an increase to $4.2 billion.The company also issued 2016 guidance of $2.60-$2.80 a share, below estimates for $2.88. It expects sales of around $14.3 billion, roughly in line with consensus for $14.29 billion.Textron shares sank 13.4%.

587,LMT,"When commercial and military aircraft parts wear down, Heico (HEI) is often the go-to supplier for replacements -- and lately more of those parts have been showing their age.It's for a good reason, though. They're getting used more, thanks in part to lower oil prices.""With lower oil prices, airlines are continuing to fly the older aircraft more; they’ve slowed down their rate of retirement substantially,"" Kenneth Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told IBD. ""Older planes are much less fuel-efficient than new ones, but with oil at $40 a barrel rather than $100 a barrel, the higher cost of operating older aircraft is not nearly as bad.""That's just one of the reasons Heico is doing barrel rolls right now. Heico is drawing revenue from a number of sources, and sales are expected to accelerate from single-digit growth last year to double-digits this year.Part of that will come from an acquisition of a parts supplier to military helicopters, but in Heico's first fiscal quarter, which ended Jan. 31, the higher growth rate had already started showing up. Revenue grew 14% over the prior year to $306.2 million. Adjusted earnings rose 20% to 49 cents a share.The company raised its 2016 forecast on revenue and now expects growth of 14% to 15% vs. 8% to 10% previously, equating to $1.35 billion-$1.38 billion. It also raised its forecast for net income growth to 10% to 13% from 8% to 10%. Analysts expect total revenue to climb 15% this year to $1.37 billion, while per-share earnings are seen rising 16% to $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.Heico has the benefit of drawing business from both the commercial and military side of aerospace. So if there is a reduction in military spending, its commercial side can pick up some of the slack. But that's not the case right now.""The U.S. defense budget is rising again,"" Victor Mendelson, Heico’s co-president, told IBD, adding that foreign military budgets in the Middle East and among some other U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan are also rising. ""NATO countries are involved in Syria and other hot spots. If these places heat up, there is a need for things we make.""In fact, both sides of the equation are humming, Mendelson says.""Air traffic is up,"" Mendelson said. ""It means that there are more planes flying, and there is greater flight frequency. The more the aircraft is utilized, the more parts Heico delivers. It’s wear and tear.""Heico manufactures and distributes a wide range of aircraft replacement parts, including combustion chambers for engines, fuel shut-off valves, back-up power supplies for emergency exit lighting, power converters on GPS satellites and even underwater-locator beacons, or ""pingers,"" for cockpit voice and data recorders, commonly known as black boxes.""Everything we do is a highly specialized niche,"" Mendelson said.Heico's military group is the smaller of its two main business units, with the flight support group the biggest. Revenue in the smaller division grew 17% to $104.2 million, reflecting acquisitions since last year, as well as 4% organic growth.First-quarter sales in the flight support group, which includes commercial aviation, rose 12% to $204.6 million, even on softer organic sales in its repair and overhaul services product line, as well as a slowdown in South America.Mendelson's co-president is his brother, Eric. Their father, Laurans Mendelson, is chairman and chief executive. The three took over the company in 1990, when it had just $26.5 million in sales, and then began an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand the firm’s product line. The South Florida-based company took in nearly $1.2 billion last year.""We knew nothing about aerospace, manufacturing or engineering. We knew about business,"" said Victor Mendelson. ""We thought we had a good idea -- to expand the parts business.""Heico is a bit like a generic-drug maker. It provides low-cost copies of original products, which are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.""Our replacement parts demand is driven by aircraft use and the airlines’ need to save money,"" said Mendelson. ""Our replacement parts are sold for 20% to 30%, less than OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts. We essentially copy the parts on the original plane.""Heico competes with smaller parts makers, as well as with the likes of General Electric (GE) and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division. Heico supplies parts for just about every airline in the world, including United Continental (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Lufthansa, British Airways and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).Heico’s $255 million acquisition of Robertson Fuel Systems in January now provides it with crash-worthy auxiliary fuel systems for military helicopters such as Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Black Hawk and Boeing's (BA) Apache and Chinook. Management increased its outlook for its electronic technologies group -- where its military work is handled -- to reflect the Robertson acquisition.Though U.S. military spending is on the rise, proposed spending on some heavy helicopters will likely be pushed back another year. Still, Heico increased its revenue estimate in its electronic technologies group for the current year to growth of 27% to 30% to include gains from Robertson.""Because Robertson’s equipment has been made standard on more helicopters, that offsets the negative effect of fewer helicopters being produced,"" Victor Mendelson said.Robertson was Heico’s largest acquisition in a long string of buyouts, starting in 1990 when the company, under its new leaders, began to branch out from its original focus on aircraft engine parts.It’s made 60 purchases since then, eight of them last year alone. One was the purchase of 80% of privately held Aerospace & Commercial Technologies, which provides products and services to maintain the F-16 fighter fleet.About half of Heico’s revenue growth comes from acquisitions, and the rest from organic growth.""We’re working on a number of possibilities now,"" Mendelson said of potential candidates.

590,LMT,"3D Systems (DDD) received a much-needed vote of confidence from an analyst report Thursday, sending shares of it and Stratasys (SSYS) rising on hopes the top two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound.Shares of both companies were hammered in 2015 as 3D Systems and Stratasys posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. In November, 3D systems announced that Avi Reichental had resigned as CEO and president after 12 years of leading the 3D printer pioneer. The company ran with an interim CEO until April 4, when 3D Systems announced it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi as CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ) -- formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.Optimism about Joshi's hiring anchored the positive report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan on Thursday. Mohan upgraded 3D Systems stock to buy from underperform and raised his price target to 26 from 11.3D Systems stock rose 10% Thursday to 18.28, hitting its highest price since June. The stock had touched a more than five-year low of 6 in January.Stratasys rose 5.9% to 29.35 and hit its highest point since October. In February, it touched a more than six-year low of 14.48.Smaller 3D priner makers Voxeljet (VJET) and ExOne (XONE) rose 8.6% and 7.6%, respectively, with ExOne achieving a nearly one-year high, and Voxeljet missing a five-month high by a penny.Merrill Lynch did not distribute the research report to the media, but according to a summary of the report from 24/7 Wall Street, Mohan wrote: “Our buy rating on 3D Systems is predicated on the strong likelihood that the new CEO will turn around the business through a new direction and strategy based on his experience as an executive of HP’s established printing business.”Mohan expects Joshi can boost earnings by improving operational efficiency and refocusing investments, “even while end-market demand remains subdued.”3D Systems and Stratasys struggled last year. 3D Systems reported 2% revenue growth in 2015, to $666 million. At Stratasys, revenue fell 7% to $696 million. Revenue for both companies, year over year, declined in each of the last two quarters of the year, ending a long string of double-digit gains for the pair.Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market, says Joshi earned a strong reputation from his work at HP.“People have a high regard for his leadership,” Wohlers told IBD. “He can take 3D Systems to the next level.""Despite a challenging year, revenue from 3D printers, supplies and services overall rose 26% in 2015, to $5.16 billion, according to Wohlers Report 2016, the latest edition of an annual publication dedicated to 3D printing. This year, Wohlers forecasts the market will grow 29% to $6.7 billion, and that it will rise 31% to $8.8 billion next year.Still, Merrill Lynch aside, most analysts continue to take a cautious tone on 3D Systems and Stratasys, even after both reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings. Observers in general are not convinced of a full-scale rebound, even as 3D printing technology is increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. And it's not just observers who are wary. Executive of both 3D Systems and Stratasys have used a cautious tone when talking about 2016.Wohlers is not among the cautious crew, at least when looking down the road a bit.“If you view the industry through the lens of investors and share price, you will have a distorted view of what’s happening in the 3D printer market,” he said. The long-term future of the technology, he says, is strong.“Some of the biggest corporations and brands in the world are making significant investments in 3D printing,"" Wohlers said. ""We see a tremendous amount of activity that is advancing the industry.”The 3D-printer believers include Nike (NKE) and General Electric (GE). Nike has said 3D printing has revolutionized the way it designs and manufactures footwear. GE has made big investments in 3D printing, which it calls additive manufacturing. GE used 3D printers to develop complex fuel nozzles for its next-generation jet engine, known as Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion, in a partnership with France-based Snecma.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Airbus (EADSY), NASA and United Technologies (UTX) are also becoming bigger users of 3D technology.While the boom in 3D printing is good news for Stratasys and 3D Systems, it has also attracted more competitors. In 2015, 62 manufacturers sold 3D industrial machines, up from 49 in 2014, says Wohlers.HP's entry is expected to ripple through the industry. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in a March 31 research note, partly pointed to HP when he rated Stratasys as a sell, with a price target of 19.“The stocks of Stratasys and 3D Systems have jumped on a sequential Q4 revenue increase and outlook for slightly up revenue in 2016. However, we are becoming more concerned about HP's entry later this year,” which could have a negative impact on the two industry leaders, he wrote.Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a research report on April 11 that he recently met with HP executives.“We believe HP is in the late stages of alpha trials and is planning a controlled launch within the next few months with a limited number of partners,” he wrote.HP has said its printers will be faster, more efficient and cost less than products currently on the market.Many 3D printer companies are based in Europe. Besides Germany's Voxeljet, they include EOS Manufacturing Solutions, a fellow German firm and one of the largest 3D printer companies, with a wide range of 3D printers. Others are Germany-based SLM Solutions, Belgium’s Materialise and Sweden-based Arcam.

Unit sales of robotic exoskeletons are projected to hit 108,000 units in 2025, up from 2,500 this year, ABI forecast.The market for robotic exoskeletons is still in its infancy, ABI analyst Dan Kara said in a statement. Lower body exoskeletons, employed as rehabilitation tools or quality-of-life enablers, currently lead the sector, he said.Industrial systems that help workers with heavy lifting, extended standing, squatting, bending and walking are on the way.""Social imperatives, military requirements and business needs, supported by technological advances, now make it possible to develop commercially viable exoskeleton systems for a wide variety of applications and markets,"" Kara said.Market leaders include Cyberdyne, Ekso Bionics, Lockheed Martin (LMT), Parker Hannifin (PH), ReWalk Robotics (RWLK), Honda (HMC) and Toyota (TM).ReWalk stock got a boost after reports last week that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has agreed to pay for the company's robotic exoskeleton to help paralyzed soldiers walk again.RELATED:Helping Paraplegics Walk Just The Start For Robot Exoskeletons.

Because CACI has (a last-12-month) net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.2x at 9-30-15, purchase of NSS for $550 million would boost its net debt/EBITDA to 4.1x and might boost CACI's borrowing costs.""However, even if CACI buys NSS and finances the deal with debt at a 5%-6% rate, it should be solidly cash flow-accretive,"" the analyst wrote. ""But a possible deal's impact on EPS would depend on the size of intangibles associated with the transaction.""Executives of CACI could not be reached for comment Monday morning. An L-3 executive said the company can't comment now, but may ""at an appropriate time.""Citing sources familiar with the deal, Reuters reported Friday afternoon that negotiations were ""exclusive"" and a deal may be announced this week, ""assuming negotiations are concluded successfully.""L-3 describes its National Security Solutions as its ""cyber business ... focused on defending networks and equipment against increasingly sophisticated attacks and applying forensics to deter cyberspace breaches. We support our military and government customers with a full spectrum of information technology expertise in designing global networks, cloud security architectures and complex computing solutions.""A small-cap member of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, CACI earns a 79 Composite Rating, meaning its stock is performing better than 79% of other publicly traded issues by a variety of metrics, such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. While sales have fallen by single-digit percentages in 11 of the last 12 quarters, CACI did grow revenue 1% year over year to $822.4 million in the last quarter, with earnings up 2% to $1.84 minus items.

602,LMT,"The U.K. government is cutting its overall budget, but it's buying F-35s faster than anticipated as it has more money earmarked for anti-terrorism.On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron said he offered France use of an air base in Cyprus for its airstrikes on Syria and said it was his ""firm conviction"" that the U.K. should join coalition airstrikes against Islamic State. A vote from the Parliament on the issue is expected before Christmas.Cameron's announcement comes as Britain is slashing its overall spending. But the defense budget is protected from the latest cuts, and Finance Minister George Osborne told Reuters Sunday that the U.K. will boost anti-terrorism spending by 30% and will invest in more aircraft carriers and planes, so Britain plans to have 24 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jets by 2023 to fill the runways of its new carriers.The jets will be the first of a total order of 138 joint strike fighters planned, and a Ministry of Defense official said the 24 jets were a ""substantial acceleration"" of its planned order time scale.But not everyone is reinforcing defense budgets after the attacks on Paris. NATO member Canada might not buy the advanced fighter, and new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to look at options with lower prices than that of the F-35.But U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told reporters over the weekend that Canada still plans to have another ""full and open"" fighter-jet competition, with the F-35 taking part, as Canada's new government hasn't completely dismissed the idea of buying the expensive new plane.Canada and the U.K. are international partners in building the advanced jet. A new fighter contest in Canada could boost Boeing's (BA) hopes of selling its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet to more international customers, as the aerospace giant seeks to extend the fighter's production.Lockheed shares closed flat at 226.03 in the stock market today.

The spending commitments will swell budgets that had already begun to revive amid heightened tensions with Russia following last year's annexation of Crimea, with Britain committing in August to spending 2% of GDP on defense.""Over the 2015-2019 period, an extra $50 billion will be added to Western European defense spending as a result of changes implemented this year,"" said Fenella McGerty, senior analyst for defense budgets at IHS Jane's.There'll be an $11 billion uplift this year, she said, driven by adjustments in France, Germany and the U.K. that began with the Jan. 7 assault on the Paris offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The most immediate response to this month's attacks saw France join air strikes against ISIS positions in Syria, with bombing sorties led by Dassault's Rafales, further burnishing the combat credentials of a warplane that's enjoyed a string of overseas order successes after deployment in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, Mali and the Central African Republic since 2007.Britain may follow suit, extending its anti-ISIS campaign from Iraq to Syria.Britain will take all 138 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighters initially ordered and triple the pace of deliveries to 2023, allowing deployment of two new aircraft carriers with a full roster of planes.Britain Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated a commitment to an Anglo-French venture for the development of military drones.U.S. companies stand to benefit from Europe's rearmament, with two of three major new spending commitments announced by Cameron involving trans-Atlantic deals.

Gen. Michael Moeller said in a study by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies that the Air Force needs 200 such bombers by 2045, reported Defense News.""Limiting production of the new bomber, LRS-B (long-range strike bomber), to 100 airframes would severely decrease the options available to national decision-makers during times of crisis or periods of instability,"" he said. ""A modernized bomber force of 200 aircraft will sustain America's asymmetric advantage in long-range precision strike for decades to come.""But he didn't say if the fleet would be entirely made up of LRS-Bs or a mix of updated older bombers along with the new plane.Retired Lt.

French President Francois Hollande said Monday his country is at war and called for a coalition including the U.S. and Russia to defeat the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for Friday's attacks that killed at least 129 people. However, President Obama said the U.S. has no plans to expand its military campaign against the militant group.Yet defense stocks rose, with guided-missile producer Raytheon jumping 4% to a new high in heavy volume. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also rose 4% and Lockheed Martin (LMT), maker of the F-35 fighter jet, climbed 3%.IBD's defense group is down about 3% for the year amid overall cuts in military spending. But Northrop has risen 27%, Lockheed is up 15% and Raytheon has climbed 13%.Acquisitions and cost-cutting have helped fuel the gains. But Raytheon is also benefitting from rising demand for its Patriot missiles; Lockheed is ramping up production of its F-35s; and Northrop recently won a contract to build the Air Force's next-generation bomber.In addition to stock price gains, all three boast strong, long-term dividend growth rates that have added to investor returns.Lockheed in late September said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 15 cents, or 10%, to $1.65 per share payable Dec. 24 to shareholders of record Dec. 1. The annual dividend of $6.60 a share yields 3.1% at the current share price, well above the S&P 500 average of 2.1%.Northrop Grumman last raised its quarterly dividend in May, a 14% increase to 80 cents a share, or $3.20 annually. The stock's annualized yield is currently 1.8%.Raytheon in March hiked its quarterly dividend more than 10% to 67 cents a share.

While Israel has the OK to buy it, the F-35 hasn't been cleared for export to other countries in the region.In February, Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said he didn't anticipate any near-term sales of the Joint Strike Fighter to the Middle East.Reports say, however, that the U.S. could start sales of the F-35 to the UAE three years after Israel gets the jet. Israel's first F-35 aircraft will be delivered next year.Lockheed shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today. Northrop shares fell 1.3%.While the UAE might be eager to get its hands on the F-35, other countries are trying to back out of commitments for the plane. Canada's new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to look at options with lower prices than that of the F-35.Meanwhile on the commercial side, things are expected to be a lot slower, and Moores said this year's show could see a record low for commercial sales.Gulf carriers have largely maxed out their orders for commercial aircraft for the next five years. In past shows, Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways dominated the runways with blockbuster widebody deals from Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY).But Emirates said last month it wouldn't be taking any new orders at the show, and Etihad and Qatar haven't made any announcements to expect something big at the show.Boeing shares finished essentially flat, while Airbus climbed 1.1%.Demand for business jets and helicopters also will likely be tepid, as sales are closely related to oil prices, which are less than half what they were in the summer of 2014, according to Moores.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

650,LMT,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported strong third-quarter results and raised its full year earnings outlook Wednesday, a day after winning a lucrative bomber contract from the Air Force over Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Fellow defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) also topped earnings views.Northrop Grumman's Q3 earnings per diluted share jumped 22% to $2.75. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $2.19. Revenue was flat at $5.98 billion, above views for $5.86 billion.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $9.70 to $9.80, up from prior guidance of $9.55 to $9.70. Northrop also raised the low end of its 2016 revenue guidance.Shares jumped 5.5% to close at 190.50 on the stock market today. The stock has several record highs in recent sessions.The company was flying high after hours Tuesday after beating out a Boeing-Lockheed Martin team for the Air Force's long-range strike bomber contract.Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said the bomber award decision was the ""best value for our nation.""Northrop has a long history of developing bombers and was the builder of the B-2.During the company's conference call, CEO Wes Bush said the company will deliver a ""highly capable and affordable bomber"" to the Air Force but declined to talk further about the program due to its classified nature.Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia told IBD that Northrop's win is ""a pretty impressive achievement.""""If you look at the differences in size, market power and overall clout of the two competitors, you can't help but be a little but surprised,"" he said of smaller Northrop's win.Boeing's Next Move?But Boeing will likely protest the contract award in the coming weeks.Or Boeing could buy Northrop to stay relevant in the defense airframe space.Boeing still could win the bid for the Air Force's T-38 trainer plane, but it faces stiff competition from four other bidders, and the contract is relatively small at only $12 billion.""It seems like Boeing will have to make a very tough choice,"" Aboulafia said. ""Exit the U.S. combat aircraft business, or they can put in a bid for Northrop.""Aboulafia said the bid could play out over the next three to four years.Last week, Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on the company's conference call that the aerospace giant's defense business ""overall is a healthy portfolio"" and that he ""likes the program structures we have.""Boeing shares edged down 0.4% to close at 147.88.The new B-3 bomber will replace Boeing's B-52s, which have been in operation since the 1950s. The Air Force plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, and the contract could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion. The first planes are slated to enter service around 2025.General Dynamics also reported results Wednesday. The defense firm's Q3 EPS climbed 11.2% to $2.28, beating views by 15 cents. Revenue rose 3.1% to $7.99 billion.General Dynamics closed up 1.6% to 150.78.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_sGRich.

Bottom line is that we won't rush this; we are doing this the right way.""Once declared ready, the F-35's first deployment is slated for Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017. IOC for the Air Force's F-35 variant is expected in 2016, and the Navy's version is seen combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.The Pentagon plans to buy 2,443 F-35s to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8Bs, though Marine Commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford, who has been tapped as the next Joint Chiefs chairman, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the F-35 buying plan is under review.International orders are expected to push the total number produced to over 3,100.The F-35 has come a long way — longer than expected — since Lockheed won the contract in October 2001. At that time, the first planes were expected to be available for military operations by 2010.The path to combat readiness has been turbulent, marked by delays, glitches and cost overruns. More recently, an issue with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caused a fire last summer. The Pentagon has said the problem has been resolved.Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, failed to meet basic requirements like identifying faults and failures. And a 2013 Defense Department inspector general report found hundreds of flaws in the way the F-35 was being produced.But defense officials remain confident in the F-35's progress and plan to ask Congress for a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes that could top $40 billion vs. piecemeal orders like last year's $4.7 billion contract for 43 planes. The Pentagon is looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.The block buy ""will really be a mark that this aircraft has made it after going through its teething stages,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The discussion over if the F-35 should have been done becomes more of a historical discussion and less of a policy discussion.""The massive bulk procurement is key to addressing the program's cost, which lawmakers are looking to slash by more than 10% with a block buy, according to Hunter.Under the most recent order, each plane without the engine costs $95 million to $116 million, depending on the variant. But a block buy could drive down costs to $80 million per plane, including the engine, according to Mark Bobbi, a military aircraft analyst at IHS.Lower costs as well as a strong performance by the Marine Corps' F-35B after being combat-approved could also help sway countries still on the fence about buying the F-35, Bobbi added. And additional foreign orders would further trim costs.So far, the F-35 seems to be hitting its marks ahead of IOC. In late June, the first live-bomb drops in a non-test environment were successful, with 14 pilots delivering 30 high explosives over a restricted area in southeastern California.""The weapons employment went extremely well and validated the simulated procedures pilots have been training to and gave us confidence in the jet's ability to perform with real weaponry as advertised,"" said Maj. Brendan Walsh, a pilot and operations officer, in a statement to IBD.In May, the plane also successfully completed 100 short takeoffs and 100 vertical landings aboard the USS Wasp, along with successful tests in both day and night conditions, according to Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office.But as the F-35 nears combat readiness, skeptics of the program have doubted its ability to perform in actual combat.According to a report in the military blog War Is Boring, an older F-16, developed by Lockheed and General Dynamics (GD), outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air combat test in January. Analysts have also questioned the F-35's effectiveness at longer ranges.But the program office has said the test plane that was matched against the F-16 wasn't equipped with updates on F-35s currently in production, such as the latest software. It also noted the F-35 is designed to hit targets from long distances rather than engage in dogfights.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

Northrop shares climbed 1.9% to 163.71.The new bomber will be the only contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years, and the loser could be forced out of the military airframe business.Analysts have speculated that Boeing could end up buying Northrop, though Citigroup analysts and Northrop's CEO have cast doubt recently on whether the bomber contract would spark a new round of defense industry consolidation.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

Sikorsky, best known as the manufacturer of Black Hawk helicopters, has faced a potentially tighter defense budget. Sinking oil prices have also brought cutbacks in the oil industry, constraining demand for helicopter transportation to oil facilities.In March, United Technologies said it was evaluating its options for Sikorsky ""to determine the best way to enhance its long-term success and create improved long-term value for UTC's customers and shareholders.""On Monday, United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes in a statement said: ""Our strategic review has confirmed that exiting the helicopter business is the best path forward for United Technologies. Sikorsky is the world's premier helicopter company and through a series of strategic wins is well positioned for long-term growth. However, separation of Sikorsky from the portfolio will allow both United Technologies and Sikorsky to better focus on their core businesses.""United also makes aircraft engines, elevators, and flight and heating systems.The company also said Monday it sees 2015 earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.55, excluding Sikorsky, with revenue coming in at $58 billion to $59 billion.When including Sikorsky's results in its full-year projections, United Technologies forecast EPS of $6.55 to $6.85, down from an earlier outlook of $6.85 to $7.05.The company's news release did not offer sales projections that included Sikorsky's results.Analysts expect full-year EPS of $7 and sales of $65.1 billion.Shares dropped 2.3% to 114.88 in the stock market today, piercing their 50-day moving average and stopping just shy of reaching their 200-day line.

""California Kid At 102Ramo still lives in L.A., where he hangs out with younger Hollywood, like 98-year-old Kirk Douglas, but decided nearly a century of interviews was enough and declined to comment for this story.Ramo was born in Salt Lake City in 1913 to Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who owned a clothing store where he spent his teens working.The whiz kid got into the University of Utah at 16 by investing his $325 savings in a better violin.He played it to win a music contest and gain the prize — a scholarship to study anything he wanted.Four years later, he had a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. At 23, he graduated magna cum laude with dual Ph.D.s in electrical engineering and physics from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.In 1936 Depression America, jobs weren't plentiful, but he was hired by GE for two reasons: his impressive academic record and because the recruiter realized Ramo's violin skills could help the company's commitment to the community symphony in Schenectady, N.Y.Ramo soon became its concertmaster while leading the research lab over the next decade.Much of the work focused on high-powered microwave frequencies for radar. He also wrote his first two books while at GE, the second of which, ""Introduction to Microwaves"" in 1945, sold 1 million copies in eight languages and continues to be used.In 1937, Ramo had married Virginia Smith and they had two sons, James and Alan. She died in 2009.Ramo enjoyed living in the Los Angeles area, and in 1946 he accepted an offer to direct electronics research at Hughes Aircraft Co. as unspent war funds poured in.He formed an effective team with Dean Wooldridge, a Caltech classmate who managed the business side of projects, such as integrated radar and fire-control systems.But in ""The Business of Science,"" published in 1988, Ramo described their frustration trying to communicate with the eccentric billionaire owner, Howard Hughes.""It was in 1950, as we were engaged in the challenging task of doubling our size, when his problems with commercial airline operations at TWA and moviemaking at RKO began to make front-page news,"" Ramo wrote. ""Department of Defense leaders expressed alarm that so large a fraction of their most urgent military-technology projects were in a company owned by Hughes. They could deliberately set out to rein in Hughes Aircraft by placing new contracts elsewhere ... yet they knew such action would destroy it and its best people would leave, and failure to perform would result.""They repeatedly hinted that it would be well if a few of the key people were to establish another company to create the competition that was needed — provided the departures did not get out of hand.""After several meetings with Hughes that confirmed their concerns, Ramo and his partner founded Ramo-Wooldridge in 1953 with the financial backing of Thompson Products, an auto parts supplier.The Pentagon quickly tapped the new firm to head development of the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), playing catch-up to the Soviets.The mission impossible: Invent a missile 10 times more powerful than existing ones. Make sure its material could withstand re-entry into the atmosphere. Include a guidance system that would land it precisely on a target on the other side of the world.Ramo and his teammate ran into plenty of glitches. Such as: After watching several test rockets blow up on their launch pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., one rose six inches before exploding.Ramo turned to the general observing the tests and quipped, ""Well, Benny, now we know the thing can fly. All we have to do is improve its range a bit.""That they did. Coordinating a maze of subcontractors, Ramo beat the Russians in producing the first ICBM in 1958, without serious cost overruns.Aiming HighAlso in 1958, Ramo merged his firm with Thompson Products to form TRW Inc., and he headed development of the Thor, Atlas and Titan rockets over the next decade.The Atlas was the launch vehicle for NASA's Mercury spacecraft that enabled John Glenn to become the first American to orbit the earth in 1962.TRW also built the space probe to Jupiter, made engines for the Apollo moon landings and invented rocket-destroying lasers.Ramo steered his team into other areas, including auto electronics and computerizing customers' bill-paying history for retailers, banks and credit card companies.In 2002 he sold his military business to Northrop Grumman (NOC).The car supply business became TRW Automotive (TRW), headquartered in Livonia, Mich., which enjoyed a 7,500% stock ride from 2009 to last summer.This month the Federal Trade Commission approved the purchase of TRW Automotive by Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen after TRW finishes its sale of its suspension business to THK Co.Back in 1964, TRW and aerospace giant Martin Marietta (now part of Lockheed Martin (LMT) formed jointly owned Bunker-Ramo Corp., with Ramo as president. It manufactured electronics for the military and developed early digital computers.In 1981, Bunker-Ramo was bought by what became Allied Signal, which merged with Honeywell (HON) in 1999.Presidential HubRamo went on to found other companies and sell them. He has also given advice to the White House, Pentagon and NASA.President Gerald Ford named him co-chairman of a group that prioritized science and technology goals. President Jimmy Carter awarded him the National Medal of Science. President Ronald Reagan gave him the Medal of Freedom and had him coach Taiwan on developing high-tech industries.""Dr. Ramo commands respect across government, business and academia,"" said Gerding. ""His greatest strength is as a communicator, with a way of taking complex scientific issues and explaining them so they can be understood by his audience, whether they are industry leaders, students, politicians or the general public. He's also fantastic at telling stories to illustrate his points.""So what has he learned about business management in his long career? He has filled several volumes with advice, such as these tips from ""Meetings, Meetings and More Meetings: Getting Things Done When People Are Involved"": While video transmission may replace some in-person gatherings, teleconferences and email don't let you assess facial expression and body language. Consider why you were invited to a meeting and develop a secret agenda, as well as anticipating those of others. If you chair a meeting, press participants to reach clarity about the differences in their viewpoints, then find common ground. Combine ethics with good manners when criticizing others. Managers should lighten up the discussion if a meeting gets tense.When he was 12, Ramo abandoned his hope of playing violin professionally after seeing the great Jascha Heifetz perform far beyond anything he thought he could attain.Before Heifetz's death in 1987, Ramo went on stage and played a duet with him, showing that with persistence and hard work, any dream can be achieved.

819,LMT,"The long-range bomber contract may not force Boeing (BA) to buy Northrop Grumman (NOC), despite widespread expectations that it will trigger industry consolidation, according to a report from Citigroup analysts released Tuesday.Boeing, which has teamed up with Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Northrop are competing for a contract estimated to be worth $70 billion to $90 billion. A decision is expected this summer.The new bomber will be the only contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years, and analysts speculate that the loser could be forced out of the defense airframe business.Under some scenarios, if Boeing loses, it might buy Northrop to hold onto a piece of the military airframe market. If Northrop loses the bid, it would be an easy takeover target as it lacks any big programs.But not so fast, says Citi analyst Jason Gursky in a note.A Northrop buyout ""runs counter to BA's telegraphed cash deployment priorities for the next few years,"" he wrote, adding that Boeing instead has its eyes on other assets like United Technologies' (UTX) Sikorsky helicopter unit.Boeing has been vocal about its plans to return its free cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Gursky also said the Pentagon is against consolidation in the industry so that it can maintain competition among contractors.While no one yet knows the outcome of the classified program, Citi said Lockheed's involvement with Boeing on the project could be in Northrop's favor, because the Department of Defense might not give Lockheed, which is already making the F-35, a piece of another major project.But preventing consolidation isn't a top focus for the Pentagon.If macro issues like consolidation weren't laid out in the original contract terms, they won't be part of the award consideration, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an earlier interview with IBD.Northrop's CEO also said consolidation would be unlikely.""I would be careful about making prognostications that the (bomber decision) alone has a reshaping impact on the industry,"" Wes Bush said in the company's Q1 conference call last week.Boeing and Northrop shares were flat in the stock market today.Related: Boeing Boeing Gone?

834,LMT,"Boeing (BA) is unlikely to deliver its first batch of refueling tankers to the Air Force by August 2017, according to a Pentagon office.The agency has ""low confidence in Boeing’s ability” to meet the deadline, the first major requirement of the $51 billion program, the Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg.The new deadline for 18 KC-46 tankers is March 2018, seven months late, and the plane could fall even more behind schedule. Boeing has failed to meet other deadlines. The initial test flight was six months late and the second was four months late.Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS, said the Air Force could be trying to keep pressure on Boeing to finish development as the company hasn’t had any major technical issues with the plane for the past several months.“I believe if they miss delivery, it will be by a few to half a dozen units of the initial tranche,” he said in an email.The Air Force could penalize Boeing for the delay, and the company will likely absorb more costs. Its fixed-cost contract with the Pentagon requires Boeing to cover overruns.Boeing expects the development phase to cost $5.59 billion, or $766 million over budget. The company has already assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.Boeing shares fell 0.5% in the stock market today.The KC-46 is a military version of the 767 commercial aircraft already in production and is expected to replace Boeing's KC-135 tankers.Analysts earlier speculated that Boeing's failure to hit milestones with the tanker was one of the major reasons Northrop Grumman (NOC) was awarded the lucrative B-21 bomber contract last year instead of the Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team.Lockheed Martin stock slid 0.2% while Northop edged up 0.1%.
"
835,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) said Tuesday it was ""optimistic"" about closing a deal for nearly 160 F-35s and is upbeat on cost reductions.Jeff Babione, the defense contractor's F-35 program general manager, said he expects talks for production lots 9 and 10 to be completed by the end of the month.""We are happy with how they are going,"" he said, though a decision on the production lots had been delayed due to the ""scale and complexity"" of the orders.The lots being negotiated are for 157 F-35 fighters, more than double the 71 airplanes under lots 6 and 7.Meanwhile, the Pentagon already has reached a deal with United Technologies (UTX) for 167 Pratt & Whitney engines in the upcoming F-35 lots.The F-35 is under fire for being over budget and behind schedule. Right now, the jet costs about $100 million each to make, but Lockheed thinks it can lower cost to $85 million in 2019.Babione touted the use of robots to help drive down costs. Engineers are using a robot to apply a coating on the fuselage, saving $6,000 per jet for a lifetime savings of $27 million. And robots are attaching nut plates with an estimated savings of $15,000 per plane or $46 million for the life of the program.But the biggest savings would come from a 450-jet bulk order, or block buy, which Babione estimates would provide $2 billion in savings, in addition to those seen from robots and other efficiencies.Lockheed had hoped for a block buy starting in 2018, but the Defense Department’s new budget request doesn’t include early funding or seek authorization for one. The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has said a block buy could mean large batches of faulty planes could enter service that will need several expensive fixes, resulting in no net cost savings.But partner countries and foreign military-sale customers could still start a block buy in 2018, without the U.S., if they let Lockheed know by June or July, Babione said.The price could fall even further, as Pratt & Whitney also is building the engines for Northrop Grumman’s (NOC) B-21 bomber.Lockheed shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares ended flat. United Tech shares climbed 1.25%.Amid the F-35 production, Lockheed is looking past its next-generation fighter and toward hypersonic propulsion.CEO Marillyn Hewson said the company is making progress with its hypersonic systems and could develop, build and fly a demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22 for under $1 billion.""We’re now producing a controllable, low-drag, aerodynamic configuration capable of stable operation from take-off, to sub-sonic, trans-sonic, super-sonic, and hypersonic to Mach 6,"" she said.
"
836,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) believes laser weapons are ""coming of age"" and ready for use as a cheaper option against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups that employ inexpensive but deadly weapons.Last year, Lockheed tested its new Athena (Advanced Test High Energy Asset) weapon, which uses a 30-kw fiber laser, by disabling a small Phantom quadcopter drone's engine and camera with precision at over a mile away. Each shot cost less than a dollar.The system can also bore a hole though two-inch steel, such as the engine of a truck,  in seconds.""The military doesn’t have a cost-effective defense against these rockets and small UAVs that are low and slow and very, very small,"" said Paul Shattuck, director of directed energy systems, at Lockheed's media day Tuesday.  ""But laser weapons can change that.""The fight against the Islamic State is proving to be costly. Each Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile costs over $1.5 million. Smart bombs cost upwards of $25,000 each. The Air Force has dropped over 20,000 missiles and bombs in its campaign against the Islamic State.Lockheed is also working on more powerful lasers that could be used against larger targets and replace expensive missiles. The company is on track to deliver a 60-kw fiber laser for field-testing for the Army later this year.Shattuck said that laser weapons don't require much more tech innovation. Instead, engineers are working on incorporating the weapons onto existing platforms.Past lasers were inefficient due to their large size, large power demand, and inability to cool. Boeing's (BA) YAL-1 Airborne Laser, a megawatt chemical laser system built in 2002, was mounted inside a modified Boeing 747.Lockheed's new 60-kw laser can be mounted on a truck.Northrop Grumman (NOC) built a roughly 100 kw solid-state laser for use on warships in 2009.But Lockheed claims its new electric fiber lasers use 50% less electricity than Northrop's, and Shattuck believes that building a 150-kw laser would be ""straight forward.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares changed little, while Boeing shares rose 1%.

837,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) CEO is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices.""We're starting to see some pressure on the budgets of countries that rely on oil revenues for a significant portion of their income,"" Marillyn Hewson said in opening remarks at Lockheed's media day Tuesday. ""And a sustained strong U.S. dollar could further pressure international sales.""Hewson said plunging oil prices could push orders and budget decisions out further or countries could not buy as many systems as planned.That tone contrasts with her more bullish one in January. In the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.On Tuesday, she said most countries are ""looking beyond today"" for a time when oil prices increase and the company has seen an uptick in munition sales.""Saudi Arabia and UAE government leaders made it clear that regional security and terrorism are at the top of their concerns,"" she added.Last April, Saudi Arabia signed a $2 billion deal for Raytheon’s (RTN) Patriot system amid rising tensions with Iran and Yemen, even as the kingdom's defense spending fell 6.8% in 2015 vs. 2014 to $46.3 billion.Earlier this month, Canaccord Genuity warned that lower oil prices are also affecting oil-dependent economies' demand for commercial jets and that UAE’s Etihad could defer some wide-body orders. But Qatar Airways may exercise an option for three more Airbus (EADSY) A380s and Oman Air is mulling another jet order.Despite cheap oil, Lockheed is still investing in the region and is looking at Blackhawk helicopter production opportunities in Saudi Arabia for its newly acquired Sikorsky division.Hewson said Lockheed hasn't changed its target of 25% of sales from foreign customers ""over the next few years"" and confirmed reports that Poland and Turkey are interested in the company's Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS). Germany picked that missile defense system over the Patriot system in June.Lockheed shares closed up 0.2% to 217.05 in the stock market today. Raytheon shares were up 0.8% to 122.72.

838,LMT,"The clock ticked and ticked and then at 8:30 am on Friday – the gov't released the all important NFP (Non Farm Payroll) report……expectations were for +200k jobs to be created…in fact they told us that 215k job were created – that's better than the expectation – and the mkt sold off (initially…). But by mid morning – the sell off had ended and the buyers became a bit more aggressive (see the ISM report)……and by the end of the day – Wall St was throwing a party – the Dow +107 pts, the S&P surged by 13 pts – ending the day at 2072 and Nasdaq charged ahead by 45 pts to end the day at 4914. What had changed?Everyone was cheering the jobs report – or were they cheering for lower rates for longer? I mean a strong jobs report would argue for higher rates – and higher rates now would cause the mkt to back off (which is what we saw early on...) – but then a funny thing happened on the way to the forum……Unemployment crept back up to 5% - as more people looked for meaningful work….the spin doctors using this as a positive – saying that the mood has changed – and people who long ago fell off the rolls are now coming back into the work force – or are at least trying (because they are all of sudden encouraged..) And deep within the jobs report – we find the different job categories and how those categories were impacted and what do we see?Manufacturing LOST 30k jobs last month and the bulk of the new jobs were what? PART TIME RETAIL. Do you see the disconnect? Yes – those part time retail jobs ARE jobs…..but the frustration is that we are once again losing good paying jobs for low paying service sector jobs…..and now you ask why wages have remained stagnant for so long? Part time retail sales jobs pay MINIMUM wages – and nothing more - while high paying jobs that do pay more continue to disappear which then puts downward pressure on wages….. So why would anyone think that there is going to be upward pressure on wages at all? So then the theory goes that rates are not going anywhere - just as Janet discussed and BOOM! The buy algo's kick in and the sellers pull back and the mkt rallies.....The funny thing is that Stephen Stanley – Chief Economist at Amherst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:""Any company facing the consumer is probably feeling pretty good about things right now. Despite a choppy economic environment for the past year – employment has been absolutely rock solid"".Did he say 'Rock Solid'? May I ask – what world is this guy living in? Did he even read the report? We lose high paying jobs and replace them with low paying jobs…….and he defines that as 'Rock Solid'? Investors, economists and our very own Janet Yellen – Fed Chair – remain suspect…..in fact many are slashing their estimates for 1qtr growth and for CY (calendar year) 2016.......(see below)…this guy is making it look like a bowl of cherries......saying that part time job creation at minimum wage rates is SOLID JOB GROWTH...Well - fast forward - an hour and half later - and we got the ISM report....at 10 am the Institute of Supply Management reported that the ISM Manufacturing index showed a gain of 51.8 – vs. the exp of 50.5……so get ready – because here is the 'kick'… at 8:30 am - The gov't reports that we are losing manufacturing jobs while at 10 am the ISM reports that we are gaining manufacturing jobs! (Beware the ISM is NOT a gov't report) And the spin machine is hard at work! How exactly are they going to reconcile these two reports so that they make sense? What is the mkt to believe? How can one report suggest weakness, while the other one suggests strength? In the end the mkt believes that jobs, wages and growth remain suspect and that the FED will hold rates steady - so higher we go....Next up - ......1st qtr earnings are expected to be -9.3% followed by 2 qtr earnings down 3.6%...... Full year 2016 earnings are now expected to be +2.2% which is an 81% reduction from the July 2015 estimates of +12% for the full year.Now we know that the analysts always start high and then progressively revise lower - and get to a point that they have lowered the bar so low - it is almost impossible to miss.........but what does this really say about the state of the economy? And if earnings are due to be negative for 2 qtrs...what will they have to be in the second half of the year to end positive? Well estimates call for +3.4% in the 3 qtr and +9.4% in the 4th qtr.....Really? We are going to get this massive recovery during the second half of 2016?Be sure to get a front row seat during earnings season – when companies report on how they did….listen carefully to the number of companies that have or will announce layoffs – Goldman Sachs (GS), Credit Suisse (CS), JP Morgan Chase (JPM),  Bank Of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Blackrock (BLK), Boeing (BA), Peabody Energy (BTU), US Steel, McKesson (MCK) have all announced layoffs - never mind the energy companies that have gotten slaughtered...... while Lockheed Martin (LMT) announced a 'voluntary layoff program'…and let me remind you – none of these lost jobs is a minimum wage job, none of these jobs is part time and none of these jobs are coming back next qtr or the qtr after that…..Mr. Stanley – would you care to comment?With earnings only days away now….I suggest that you pay attention to the top line revenues and bottom line profits – if they miss on the top line yet beat on the bottom line – then that just means that they continue to CUT expenses (wink, wink!) to achieve these 'great' results….US futures are up again this morning - currently +5 . The dollar is a bit stronger and oil is retreating....now trading at $36.71/barrel.....which is giving this latest surge some oomph....The mkt does feel like it wants to test the 2100 level.....before it rests.....and with little or no resistance right now - it is entirely possible we do so before the start of earnings season.....Today 's eco data includes ISM NY, Factory orders - exp of -1.8%, ex trans of -0.5%. Durable goods of -2.8% , ex trans of -1%. ...Not sure - but to me - negative numbers do not suggest strength at all.....Would anyone care to comment?And yes they do....today we get 3 FED mouthpieces...Boston's Eric Rosengren at 10:15 and Dallas Pres - Kaplan and Minneapolis's Neel Khashari both after the bell.Now you will recall that Khaskari was Hank Paulson's right hand man during the crisis and the country rewarded him with the Minneapolis FED Pres position last year. He is now singing a very different tune than he did when he was in the treasury office.....so - expect a lot of chatter after his speech as analysts and strategists dissect it. Dallas's Kaplan is also new on the scene...appointed in September - so the community is still trying to figure out which side of the fence he is on..... appears to be more of a Hawk.....So here we go again......Janet says 'no' and the mouthpieces say 'yes'......expect more confusion and volatility as we move into earnings.Take Good Care

853,LMT,"As the Air Force readies 60-year-old B-52 bombers to prosecute the war against the Islamic State, a separate air war is looming over Congress amid opposition to the Pentagon's acquisition strategy for the B-21 bomber, which is supposed to replace the aging aircraft.Six years after an earlier attempt to update the bomber fleet was canceled due to high costs, the Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman (NOC) the B-21 contract in October. Work was held up by a protest from the losing Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team, but the Government Accountability Office rejected it last month.Now the B-21, which could cost $50 billion-$80 billion, is taking flak from lawmakers over the Pentagon's use of a contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.“I remain seriously concerned about the acquisition strategy for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, especially the use of a cost-plus contract for the development of this aircraft,” said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a hearing earlier this month.When asked if he would use the defense authorization bill to block the contract, a McCain spokeswoman said the senator would ""consider his legislative options.""Cost-plus contracts have been used for programs -- like Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop's B-2 -- that are now known for sky-high price tags. Production on the F-22 and B-2 ended early, due in part to ballooning costs.Despite McCain's concerns, the Air Force is moving ahead with its latest stealth weapon. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said last week that the service decided to use a cost-plus contract for development because of risks associated with building a completely new airframe.The options for the first five production lots, which include 21 aircraft, are fixed price, meaning the contractor absorbs additional costs.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are also risks with using fixed-price contracts.General Dynamics’ (GD) F-111 attack aircraft, Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft, and Lockheed's C-5 transport plane were all fixed-price contracts that went well over budget, he said. The government then has no choice but to help out the industrial base or risk a ripple of bankruptcies from various suppliers, he added, drawing a comparison to the auto bailout.""Almost without an expectation, the government has had to pay extra,"" Hunter said of planes bought at fixed prices. ""The government has the decision to cancel the program and get nothing, or pay more to actually get the airplane.""Critics of the cost-plus contract point to Boeing's KC-46 refueling tanker, which is under a fixed-price contract. The aerospace giant has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the Air Force's Bunch cautioned against comparing the B-21 with the tanker, pointing out that the KC-46 is a derivative of a commercial plane, Boeing's 767, and has potential for foreign sales. The B-21 has no commercial version and no prospects at this time for international sales to allies, he said.And while the B-21 will use mature technology, there are still risks from integrating the technology into a new plane, Bunch added.McCain also has issues with the Air Force not disclosing the full price of the bomber, though it puts the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" he asked March 8.The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force can't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts.They include United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems and Rockwell Collins (COL).Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate’s Appropriations Committee, said last week that he was pleased that the engines would be built at a factory in his home state, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed his sentiments.McCain's House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this month that he would like to see more mature technology on big-ticket programs, lowering the risk and need for cost-plus contracts. But he didn't voice a stance on the B-21 contract.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service will continue to “communicate” with Congress about the contract, as the B-21 “is a capability we need for the country.” The Air Force estimates an initial operational capability in the mid-2020s.While the B-2 is a stealth plane, it still lights up radars on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, as it looms over the latest bomber contract. Considered a poster child for Pentagon overspending, only 21 B-2s were built at a cost of more than $2 billion each.But James said she's learned from the B-2's failures, and the Air Force is taking a different approach with the B-21 this time.“The B-2 remained in the shadows for too long,"" she said. ""Too many details remained classified too long.""

He also considered A330s with revamped engines but thought the larger and lighter A350 was the better long-term option.The 13 jets have a list price of $4 billion but airline typically get discounts for large orders.Oman Air also has Boeing (BA) 787s and single-aisle jets in its fleet.Airbus shares closed down 1.9% in the stock market today. Boeing shares rose less than 0.1%. Boeing is trying to retake its 50-day moving average.

858,LMT,"The Pentagon and Congress haven't yet agreed on a bulk order for Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, but international buyers who want to participate can expect ""massive savings,"" even if the U.S. doesn't join until later, according to the stealth fighter program's chief.The Defense Department's new budget request doesn't include early funding or seek authorization for a block buy in fiscal 2017.But Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program executive officer, told reporters Wednesday that partner countries and foreign military sale customers would still want to do a three-year block buy starting in 2018.""Even if U.S. services decide not to become part of the block buy in 2018 but come in later, we are still looking at $2 billion in savings,"" he said at a briefing.Defense acquisition officials hope a block buy order for up to 500 planes can cut costs for the $400 billion program.But the Pentagon's top weapons tester recently cast doubt on prospects for savings, noting the risk of going ahead with a block buy while technical issues still need to be fixed.A report from the Operational Test & Evaluation office last week said a block buy could mean large batches of faulty planes enter service that will need several expensive fixes, resulting in no net cost savings.“The department should carefully consider whether committing to a ‘block buy,’ composed of three lots of aircraft, is prudent given the state of maturity of the program,” the report said.Lockheed shares closed down 0.9% to 213.95 in the stock market today.

859,LMT,"WASHINGTON, D.C.- The Air Force's  Chief of Staff is ""pretty confident"" that the Air Force's variant of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 will meet its target date for combat readiness, but trouble with the engine's integration remains a major issue.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday,  Gen. Mark Welsh said that while he sees the F-35A variant meeting its target initial operational capability (IOC) timeframe of Aug.1 to the end of the year, the plane still has some problems.The biggest issue right now is getting the engine data incorporated into the plane's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) as the parts come from two different contractors. ALIS, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, is managed by Lockheed while the engine is built by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney.Welsh said he expects to have the data integrated in July, giving the service a month to see how it works in operations before the IOC window opens.Lockheed shares fell 0.4%  to 217.20 in the stock market today. United Technologies shares edged up 0.5% to 95.53.Also Lockheed is working ""24/7"" on fixing problems with the fighter's software including radar stability issues, Welsh said.Last month, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program’s executive officer, said that issues with how the software in the F-35’s sensors works with the main computer are a concern and if they aren't improved by the end of May, the Air Force might have to push back the IOC target date.Welsh said that Lockheed developed a change to fix the problem in the labs last month and will put it in the platform this month.The Air Force isn't the only service to have continued issues with the problematic F-35.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday, Gen. Robert Neller, Marine Corps Commandant,  said that he has “concerns about where the software was” and wants Lockheed to “go faster.”  But Neller is still confident in the aircraft, saying it will get better as development continues and that his pilots are “very positive and very excited” about the plane.Still the Air Force has been hitting necessary milestones with the F-35 before IOC.  The service said that the F-35A dropped bombs for the first time in training last week at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.As for the Air Force's new B-21 bomber, Welsh didn't have any updates as to when more information about the engine maker and other subcontractors would be announced. Last week Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James said that more details would be announced in the coming weeks.Northrop Grumman (NOC) won bomber deal in October over a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed team, but few details have been released about the secretive program.Northrop shares fell 0.3% to 193.32. Boeing shares were down 0.3% to 119.65.

860,LMT,"The Marine Corps Commandant wants Lockheed Martin (LMT) to hurry up with the F-35's software development, which will enable additional capabilities on the next-generation stealth fighter.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday, Gen. Robert Neller said that while the F-35 is ""aeronautically sound,"" he has ""concerns about where the software was"" and wants Lockheed to ""go faster.""Neller said the F-35 needs the 3F software and will hold the vendor accountable for that. An updated 3F version of the software will give the F-35 full war-fighting capabilities next year, including the ability to fire the plane's 25-millimeter Gatling gun.As of May 2015, 97.5% of the required F-35 software is currently flying and 99.9% of the required software has been coded, according to Lockheed's website. But about 10,000 lines of code still need to be written.The Marines F-35B variant was declared combat-ready in July and is set for deployment to Japan in early 2017.Neller is still confident in the aircraft, saying it will get better as development continues and that his pilots are ""very positive and very excited"" about the plane.But last month, a top Air Force official said the service might have to delay declaring its F-35A variant combat-ready unless issues with the software were worked out. The Air Force has an Aug. 1 target date set for the F-35A’s initial operating capability.But the Air Force's fighter reached a milestone toward combat readiness recently. The service said that the F-35A dropped bombs for the first time in training last week at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.Lockheed shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today.

The bomber will replace decades-old Boeing (BA) B-52s.But obstacles to the B-21's progress have recently been lifted, and additional details will come out, including information about subcontractors that's expected next month.Earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office found “no basis” to sustain or uphold Boeing's challenge to the bomber contract, allowing Northrop to resume work on it.Northrop won the bomber deal in October, but Boeing and teammate Lockheed Martin (LMT) issued a formal protest soon after, saying the Air Force’s decision was “fundamentally flawed.”Boeing also won't take legal action on the contract. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said Friday the company stands behinds the issues it raised in the protest but won't pursue any further challenges either through the GAO or federal court.Boeing shares closed up 1.15% in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.4%, and Lockheed slipped 0.5%.But bomber program still faces political hurdles. Earlier this week, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said he would block the Air Force from using a cost-plus contract because it makes the government, not the company, responsible for cost overruns.Currently, the Air Force is using a cost-plus contract for the engineering and development phased of the new bomber, while the production of the first five sets of the plane would use a firm contract.

869,LMT,"Proofpoint has been on a buying spree, making relatively small but strategic acquisitions. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based provider of security software via the cloud spent $24 million for NetCitadel and $35 million for Nexgate last year. In March, Proofpoint agreed to pay $40 million for security firm Emerging Threats.It was money well spent, CEO Gary Steele says, enhancing Proofpoint's (PFPT) capabilities in advanced threat intelligence, security for social media channels and automated security incident response. Proofpoint stock has roughly tripled in the past two years and sports a high IBD Relative Strength Rating of 94.Steele was brought in at Proofpoint's start in 2002, when the company focused almost exclusively on email security. He has overseen an evolution at Proofpoint, drawing on previous experience as CEO of applications company Portera, bought by Exigen Group in 2002, and at Sybase, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Now Proofpoint is pioneering next-generation, cloud-based cybersecurity that combines Big Data analytics, threat intelligence capabilities and dynamic malware analytics to block cyberattacks. In Q1, Proofpoint said that revenue for its targeted-attack protection business more than doubled from Q1 2014. Overall revenue rose 35% to $57.8 million, Proofpoint's 47th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.Proofpoint says that its customers include 49 of the Fortune 100 companies, including Citibank (C), HCA (HCA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Steele said that companies are looking to avoid risks associated with malware delivered through email, among other risks. ""Because the stakes are so large and because the infrastructure available to the hacking community is so significant, these campaigns and these attacks will continue to evolve at a very, very rapid rate,"" Steele said. ""Fundamentally, the challenge for the security industry is to innovate at a faster rate than the hackers are. Some of the larger, incumbent security companies have struggled with the level of innovation that's required.""Proofpoint says that it devotes roughly 20% of revenue to R&D.Steele recently spoke with IBD about the security industry.IBD: What are your goals for Proofpoint in 2015 and 2016?Steele: When we look at the opportunity in front of us, we're very much focused on taking share from the larger incumbent vendors. As the security landscape has changed, customers are demanding additional protection, additional capability. We see today what's driving our growth is organizations searching for solutions that ensure they're well protected from this next generation of threats. We see organizations oftentimes running some legacy email security solution, plus some sort of anti-virus. Those capabilities don't protect these organizations from the targeted attacks that companies are being hit with today. We've developed a broad set of capabilities that identify and block those kinds of campaigns coming into the enterprise.Another key element of our growth is expansion, geographically. Roughly just under 20% of our business has come from international markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity of driving our solutions in international markets. We started this last year and will continue to invest because we see great opportunity outside the U.S., specifically in Europe and other international markets.IBD: How does your Nexgate Social Media Threat Center address social media threats?Steele: Our research has found that the Fortune 100 brands are experiencing at least one compromise a business day on their social media channel. As social has really grown within these organizations, so has the threat and risk associated with it. The reality today is that as large brands rely more heavily on social, they must have security because a hack or a compromise can have a significant impact on their overall brand.The opportunity for Proofpoint is to provide a level of security compliance that helps identify attacks that may come in through social. Now we're posting on people's social pages ... . We've coupled with that the integration of our back-end security capabilities, where we basically can deliver more depth and sophistication in the way which we can identify.We also see a big need for compliance. They have to make sure they comply with various regulations for their industry.IBD: Dridex, a malware that aims to steal online banking credentials when users log in to online bank accounts, is on the rise. What does that mean for the banking industry?Steele: One of the key themes we've seen in the threat landscape over the course of the last few quarters is Dridex attacks, coming through phishing, that basically have evaded the traditional anti-virus systems that people have in place. This has been a big challenge in the financial services industry, where these are pieces of malware that fundamentally go right through the legacy infrastructure. So it creates a huge amount of cleanup work on the part of the IT organizations. The only way this problem gets solved is if you're running modern architectures that block these kinds of advanced threats. This is a big theme, one of the current themes we see from hackers today. It will evolve and change, but it has been a huge headache for the financial services industry.IBD: What do folks need to know about phishing campaigns around the IRS and tax liabilities?Steele: One of the things that we have seen going into 2015 is a significant number of phishing campaigns focused around the IRS. A tax audit, a tax refund, these are very common phishing themes used by hackers to compel someone to click. They're quite effective, frankly. These broad campaigns started as we entered 2015. We saw a shift as we got to tax day on April 15 to much more about the refunds and scams around refunds. The hackers always follow the money. They're going to go where they know there's opportunity. Clearly, the IRS gets your attention.IBD: Proofpoint reported a 36% increase in subscription service in Q1, accounting for 97% of revenue. Is that where you want to be?Steele: What's really exciting is we have a fast-paced business model with a very high percent of recurring revenue. From an investor's perspective, the core benefit that we deliver, because we have such a high subscription number, is the fact that you get a very nice level of predictability. So we like that very high percentage of subscription revenue. It represents, when you look at our high renewal rate — which has consistently run over 90% with this broad, recurring base — a very powerful business model. We think that one of the most compelling aspects for investors is this high recurring revenue run rate.

871,LMT,"The Air Force is reportedly pushing back the retirement date of its well-armed and heavily armored A-10 Warthog, meaning Lockheed Martin (LMT) will have to wait a bit longer before it becomes a bigger player in close-range combat.Defense officials told Defense One that the A-10 Warthog had become essential to the fight against ISIS, which has grown in Iraq and Syria and upended the military's plans a few years ago to devote more resources to the F-35.The new plan to delay the plane's retirement will be outlined in the Pentagon's 2017 budget request to Congress, Defense One said. The final budget plan is still being worked out, Defense One said.The Air Force had wanted to retire the A-10 — which has been in service for around 40 years and has its share of supporters on Congress — before or around 2021. Doing so would allow the U.S. to allocate more finances toward the F-35, which is set to take over its role, Defense One said.The F-35, meanwhile, has faced a variety of technical and budgeting setbacks, concerns about its maneuverability vs. other jets, and its ability to sustain damage in battle. What's more, the F-35 is a sleeker stealth fighter, while the A-10 wasn't designed with sleekness in mind. In tests set for 2018, the military will compare and contrast the F-35's abilities against those of the A-10.Shares of Lockheed Martin rose 0.9% in the stock market today. The defense contractor, in a partnership with Boeing (BA), last year lost out to Northrop Grumman (NOC) in a bid for a huge contract to build the Air Force's long-range strike bomber.Northrop climbed 0.4%, and Boeing rose 0.8% in Thursday trade.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

989,LMT,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Defense Department is making a big push to attract companies in Silicon Valley like Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), but venture capital firms are warning fledgling companies to stay away, said an Air Force acquisition official.The number one reason why tech firms are leery of working with the Pentagon is overseas trading restrictions, Camron Gorguinpour, the director of transformational innovation for the Air Force, told IBD.Many tech firms are worried that if they do DOD work, they won't be able to sell their technology overseas or will have to jump though several hoops before getting permission — issues that traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) face.But the Pentagon is looking at ways to relax some restrictions as it hopes to build better relationships with Silicon Valley, Gorguinpour said in an interview at an Air Force Association event.Lockheed shares climbed 1% to close at 204.76 in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.4% to 166.78. Apple shares rose 0.6% to end the day at 115.00. Facebook shares edged up 0.5% to 94.41.Silicon Valley and the Pentagon have been at odds recently, especially after Edward Snowden's leaks pertaining to government surveillance.Those strains added to the already vast cultural differences between the two sectors — the slow moving, rigid, formal Pentagon and the rapidly developing, informal, creative tech firms.The Pentagon has tried to bridge the divide by opening an office in Silicon Valley as it looks to beef up its cybersecurity and build advanced weapons more quickly.Last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced funding for the Flexible Hybrid Electronic Institute in San Jose, Calif., led by the FlexTech Alliance. It's a consortium of 162 companies, universities and nonprofits that includes Apple, Applied Materials (AMAT), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Boeing (BA), Lockheed, and General Motors (GM).He also visited LinkedIn's (LNKD) headquarters to find out how the Pentagon can compete for new employees in tech. In an earlier trip to Silicon Valley, Carter met with Facebook officials.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

Bezos founded Blue Origin 15 years ago, following through on his longtime passion for space flight.""As a kid, I was inspired by the giant Saturn V missions that roared to life from these shores,"" Bezos said in a statement . ""Now we are thrilled to be coming to the Sunshine State for a new era of exploration.""Blue Origin, based in Kent, Wash., is planning to send scientists, researchers and tourists to the edge of space in its New Shepard space capsule.Blue Origin last year announced a contract to build rocket engines for United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Blue Origin will serve as the primary propulsion provider for Boeing and Lockheed's next-generation launch system, called Vulcan.In addition to launching from Florida later this decade, Blue Origin will also build the rockets in the state.""We'll have a 21st century production facility where we'll focus on manufacturing our reusable fleet of orbital launchers and readying them for flight again and again,"" Bezos said.Bezos' announcement follows similar moves by Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who has been launching rockets made by his company SpaceX from Cape Canaveral for five years. SpaceX has multibillion dollar contracts to launch satellites and to ferry cargo to the International Space Station. Last year, NASA announced it had selected Boeing and SpaceX to construct new spacecraft that would transport astronauts to and from the space station.Musk founded SpaceX in 2002. SpaceX is based in Hawthorne, Calif., where Musk also has a Tesla facility. SpaceX currently has over 60 launch missions on manifest representing over $7 billion under contract. In addition to running SpaceX and Tesla, Musk is also the chairman of solar installation leader SolarCity (SCTY).SpaceX had 18 successful launches before its Falcon 9 rocket exploded about two minutes into a flight to the space station on June 28, after a structural part in the rocket's upper stage failed. Following investigations, SpaceX is expected to resume launches in spring 2016.Blue Origin took to the skies with the first test launch of its New Shepard space vehicle in May. The launch occurred from a test flight center in west Texas, reaching a speed of Mach 3 and a planned sub-orbital altitude of 307,000 feet, or 58 miles.

1025,LMT,"Details are finally emerging on the size and shape of a secretive new stealth bomber for the Air Force, and the designs are further along than expected, according to reports Wednesday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) is facing off against a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for the contract, which could be worth $50 billion-$80 billion. Analysts have said the contest is a tossup, as the competing designs for the project have been kept secret.But after a meeting the Air Force held with stakeholders on the project, some clues as to what the bomber will look like have come out. For example, the designs were larger than UCLASS drones being developed for the Navy but smaller than Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber, sources told Defense News.Another source said that the design could have 20% less payload and 20% less range than the B-2, and the winner of the contract could produce a design similar to the UCLASS designs submitted by Boeing and Northrop. Those UCLASS drones resemble the ""flying wing"" design that also appears in the B-2.A separate source told Defense News that a smaller plane doesn't mean a smaller range, adding that the ability to carry different types of munitions was highlighted.Northrop shares closed up 3.3% in the stock market today. Boeing shares finished 2.5% higher, and Lockheed climbed 3.2%.The sources were surprised by how ""mature"" the designs were, far above what is typical for a pre-award program. Both designs have gone through wind tunnel testing and survivability tests, but neither has flown.The Air Force's new bomber will replace aging Boeing B-52s, which have been in operation since the 1950s. The service plans to buy 80-100 of the new planes and is targeting a price tag of about $550 million each.The contact was supposed to be announced in the spring, but the date was pushed back and is expected by the end of this month.The stakes for the contract are high as the bomber will be the only major contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years. Analysts have speculated that the loser could be forced to leave the combat airframe business, leading to another round of consolidation in the industry.While the contract is still to close to call, analysts speculate that Boeing could have lost points on its bid due to issues surrounding its problematic aerial refueling tanker program.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

""I've taken a look at the folks that we have doing it, and we have the capacity and they have the time and they've got the parts.""A software patch for the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, also will be ""satisfactory"" and will have the plane working at its ""highest capacity.""Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the F-35 program continues to ""encounter slower than expected progress in developing the Autonomic Logistics Information System.""The stealth jet is behind schedule and over budget, but Dunford stressed the need for the plane because other jets in service are near the end of their life-cycles.Software glitches have been a persistent problem, and earlier reports said software issues will prevent the F-35 from being able to fire its 25mm cannon until 2019.Also during the hearing, Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

1044,LMT,"Boeing (BA) has given a name to its new space capsule that will ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, while NASA moved forward on carrying out operational missions.The Boeing capsule, known as CST-100, was named Starliner, the company announced Friday in Florida. Boeing made the announcement during the unveiling at the Kennedy Space Center of the crew capsule's factory, formerly a space shuttle maintenance hangar. The craft will be ready for operational missions by the end of 2017.NASA has formally ordered one such flight for Boeing to transport crew members to the ISS, and is talking with SpaceX for a similar flight, the Wall Street Journal reported.SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who is also the founder and CEO of electric car company Tesla Motors (TSLA) and chairman of solar installation leader SolarCity (SCTY). SpaceX is based in Hawthorne, Calif., where Musk also has a Tesla facility.Before SpaceX signs on to transport astronauts, it will have to ensure a safe return of its Falcon 9 rocket. The booster rocket has been grounded since June 28, when it exploded about two minutes after liftoff. SpaceX said the explosion was due to a structural part in the rocket's upper stage that failed. That also destroyed its unmanned Dragon cargo capsule destined for the space station.The explosion, along with the failed launch of an Orbital ATK (OA) Antares rocket last October, has left NASA currently dependent on Russia to resupply the ISS. Orbital ATK has said it expects to return to flight of its Antares rocket early next year. SpaceX is expected to return to flight later this year.Boeing plans to launch its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule to the ISS using an Atlas V rocket from the United Launch Alliance, which is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Last year, NASA announced it had selected Boeing and SpaceX to construct new spacecraft that would transport astronauts to and from the ISS. The contracts are valued at $4.2 billion for Boeing and $2.6 billion for SpaceX. SpaceX also has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for cargo missions to the ISS. The company has a list of more than 50 planned satellite launches for governments and companies worldwide.Competition in the space market has intensified with the emergence of SpaceX and Blue Origin, the commercial space company created by Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin took to the skies with the first launch of its new space vehicle in April. Blue Origin was selected by the United Launch Alliance to serve as the primary propulsion provider for its next-generation launch system.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter: @IBD_BDeagon.

Gen. Jon Davis, deputy commandant for Marine aviation, said at a press briefing late Monday.Davis said that shipboard testing in May and live-bomb drops in June were successful.Now, Marine Commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford will need to sign off on the tests for the jet to finally be approved for combat.Lockheed shares were up 1.7% to 204.54 in the stock market today.Once declared ready, the F-35B's first deployment is slated for Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017. IOC for the Air Force's F-35 variant is expected in 2016, and the Navy's version is seen combat ready between 2018 and 2019.When the Pentagon first awarded the contract in 2001, the plane was expected to be available for military operations by 2010. But the $400 billion program has been slowed by delays, glitches and cost overruns, including an issue with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine that caused a fire last summer. The Pentagon has said the problem has been resolved.There are still software issues with the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues. But an updated 3F version of the F-35's software with full war-fighting capabilities is expected to come out in 2017.The Pentagon has ordered 8 batches of the jet, and 11 countries are expected to place orders. Defense officials plan to ask Congress for a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes that could top $40 billion vs. piecemeal orders like last year's $4.7 billion contract for 43 planes. The Pentagon is looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.Overall, the Defense Department plans to buy 2,443 of the new planes to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8Bs. But Gen. Dunford, who has been tapped as the next Joint Chiefs chairman, told the Senate Armed Services Committee recently that the F-35 buying plan is under review.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

The plane is well over budget and behind schedule. Lockheed won the contract in 2001 and expected to have it ready by 2010.The Marine Corps must carry out an operational readiness inspection on the F-35B version before declaring it combat ready.

Defense chiefs are looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.The block buy is key to addressing the program's cost, which lawmakers are looking to slash.

The State Department will now review requests for armed drones from Italy and Turkey.Lockheed could notably stand to gain from increased drone exports: the General Atomics' Predator and Reaper drones use Lockheed missiles.The State Department's decision could also boost makers of drone components.""Additional sales of Reapers to international users would benefit Raytheon, maker of the MTS-B multispectral targeting sensor, and L-3 Communications (LLL), which provides satellite communications components and training simulators,"" said Guggenheim Partners' Roman Schweizer in a note.

1242,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has worked out some mechanical issues on the F-35 and racked up more orders, but there are still problems with the stealth jet that could weigh on quarterly earnings.The defense giant reports Tuesday, kicking off a busy week for aerospace companies and Pentagon contractors. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a nearly 40% jump in Lockheed's fourth-quarter EPS to $2.85 per share. Sales are seen rising 3% to $11.9 billion.During the last quarter, the $400 billion F-35 program got a boost when the Pentagon ordered an eighth batch of fighter jets for $4 billion. The contract also includes additional cost savings. In October, the U.K. announced an agreement in principle to order four more F-35s, bringing the total order up to 14. Israel also has plans to buy more F-35s.United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it would supply a seventh batch of F125 engines for the F-35, also with some cost savings.And more orders could come as production costs fall. Operational costs should also fall 15%, Rear Adm. Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, told Reuters last year.But developmental problems persist. After an engine fire that temporarily grounded the F-35 fleet last summer, other issues continue to plague the program.Due to delays in software development, the F-35B model won't be able to fire its 25mm cannon by the Marine Corps' July target to declare the jet ready for combat use.Software issues don't stop with the gun. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of combat testing, told Congress recently there were ""serious deficiencies with hardware and software used to develop data files"" in the plane's computers. The files help identify enemy radar and ""are essential.""But the plane remains in demand around the world. And while the Pentagon and militaries abroad have scaled back budgets, the rise of the Islamic State, unrest in Syria and an aggressive Russia could mean more spending on high-tech weaponry like the F-35.General Dynamics (GD) is slated to announce Q4 results Wednesday. The defense contractor is seen posting a 21% rise in EPS to $2.13 but revenue is seen declining 0.8% to $8.04 billion.Northrup Grumman (NOC) is scheduled to announce results Thursday. The maker of the B-2 Spirit strategic bomber and the Global Hawk drone is expected to report a 6.1% increase in EPS to $2.25 but a 2.7% drop in revenue to $5.99 billion.Last week Northrop CEO Wes Bush said that he was happy with the government's approval of some drone exports but is still concerned that U.S. companies are losing market share over the ban on exporting large drones.Raytheon (RTN) is also slated to announce results Thursday. Analysts expect it to report a 23.3% jump in earnings per share and sales are seen rising 3.4% to $6.07 billion.The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 59 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from 104 eight weeks ago.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

The first is scheduled for delivery in 2018.The drones ""will provide critically needed wide-area surveillance capability to military commanders so they can make more informed decisions,"" Northrop Grumman said in a statement, according to Reuters.South Korea has prioritized its defense spending this year as tensions with China heat up over a contested area in the East China Sea. And earlier this year, North Korea fired two short-range missiles toward Seoul.South Korea is also strengthening its fighter fleet. It originally planned to replace older fighters with Boeing 's (BA) F-15, which met budget requirements, but the military pressured the government into purchasing 40 pricier Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 stealth fighters.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

The pairing will create a global top-10 drugmaker, with combined annual revenue of more than $23 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.Actavis said Monday at the JPMorgan conference that it expects its Q4 EPS to top Wall Street estimates by 10%-15% amid strong sales. Actavis consolidated from late November through Monday, when it rose to an all-time high. It touched an intraday high at 272.28 Tuesday but pulled back to close down 1%.Celgene Bullish On RevlimidOn Monday at the conference, Summit, N.J.-based drugmaker Celgene (CELG) gave a generally bullish forecast for its flagship cancer-fighting drug Revlimid, which accounts for an estimated 66% of sales.Celgene expects overall sales to climb to about $20 billion by 2020, up from about $7.34 billion in 2014.Near term, Celgene guided Q4 sales below views, partly on negative currency effects; but preliminary EPS topped Wall Street targets. Sales of Revlimid will climb about 14% to $5.6 billion-$5.7 billion in 2015 as the drug gains approvals to treat more types of cancer.Celgene stock formed a cup-with-handle base from January to mid-June with an 80.03 buy point. It gapped up and has risen about 50%. On Tuesday, the stock rose 2.6% to 119.98, hitting a new high after rising 2.9% Monday. Celgene stock cleared a 1-month consolidation that's too short to be a proper base; it is extended above its 50-day and 200-day averages.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

The industry group's headline index, based on a survey of 129 CEOs, fell to 85.1 in Q4 from 86.4 in Q3 and 95.4 in Q2. Nearly three quarters — 74% —…
"
1399,LMT,"Falling oil prices and a declining energy sector are expected to have dragged down corporate earnings in 2014's fourth quarter, but the overall picture for S&P 500 companies remains strong.
"
1400,LMT,"The difference is remarkable: S&P 500 companies should average solid 4.2% Q4 profit growth. But when excluding energy firms, profits probably rose a brisk 7.2%.
"
1401,LMT,"With both U.S. and Brent crude oil prices falling fast in Q4 — now below $50 per barrel, down about half since the summer — the S&P's energy sector is forecast to post poor fourth-quarter numbers, with an estimated 20% decline in earnings and a 14.2% drop in revenue expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That's a staggering decline from the 11.1% earnings growth analysts had predicted Oct. 1 for Q4.
"
1402,LMT,"As a result, the overall S&P 500 earnings estimate of 4.2% growth in Q4 is the weakest since the third quarter of 2012. Revenue is expected to have grown a measly 1.3% overall in Q4 vs. 3.9% when excluding energy stocks.
"
1403,LMT,"Picture Improves In 2015
"
1404,LMT,"The trend looks similar as the picture improves in 2015. Analysts expect earnings to grow 5.2% in Q1 on revenue growth of 1.6%. Excluding energy, that growth would be 10.5% profit improvement on a 4.7% revenue hike.
"
1405,LMT,"Energy companies are expected to post a 33% decline in Q1 earnings on a 16% drop in revenue.

"
1416,LMT,"Up next, the S&P's consumer discretionary sector is expected to post 7.9% earnings growth on 4% better revenue as cheaper gasoline means more money for consumers to spend elsewhere. These companies mostly serve U.S. consumers, who drive 70% of the economy.
"
1417,LMT,"Consumer discretionary play Lowe's (LOW) is expected to post 39% earnings growth, while analysts estimate homebuilder Lennar (LEN) to have earned 32% more in Q4. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is expected to have earned 91% more than a year earlier.
"
1418,LMT,"Financials, a powerhouse of growth in most recent years, with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) leading the way, appears to have flattened with forecast 1.3% growth in earnings on a 1.4% gain in revenue.
"
1419,LMT,"Yet, for all the winners from cheaper oil, there are some non-winners that are difficult to call losers because they're still profitable, just less so. ExxonMobil (XOM) is expected to post a 26% profit decline. Analysts anticipate earnings declines of 32% for Chevron (CVX) and 39% for ConocoPhillips (COP).
"
1420,LMT,"Consumer staples are expected to have generated no profit growth.

1421,LMT,"Only those energy profits are expected to have fallen harder than the materials sector.
"
1422,LMT,"Materials, which were forecast on Oct. 1 to post 10.1% earnings growth, are now expected to have shrunken profit by 2% in Q4 on a 1% drop in revenue. Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals maker Monsanto (MON), which reported Jan. 7, reduced EPS 30% while revenue fell 8.7% from a year earlier.
"
1423,LMT,"The U.S. economy is being propelled by low interest rates, lower unemployment, higher business and consumer confidence and stocks near record highs, but the rest of the world seems a bit dicey. Europe has fallen into deflation and flirts with recession, Russia wilts under falling oil prices and Western sanctions, and Greece again may exit from the eurozone. China isn't growing as much as its government might like, while Japan and Brazil endure recessions.

The U.S. provides $1.3 billion for Egypt to use to buy military equipment from U.S. businesses.

1465,LMT,"In 1927, Juan Trippe launched Pan American World Airways as a mail carrier ferrying passengers between Key West, Fla., and Havana.By the time he retired four decades later, Pan Am had 40,000 employees serving 7 million passengers a year flying to 86 countries.In the process, Trippe:• Invented the modern airline industry.• Introduced cockpit electronics to fly in any weather.• Ordered aircraft that were far beyond what builders thought they could produce.• Forced the world to open its airports to affordable tourism.""Trippe was an unrivaled visionary and the greatest missionary of the jet age,"" William Stadiem, author of ""Jet Set,"" told IBD.Trippe (1899-1981) was born in Sea Bright, N.J. His father was an investment banker who took him at 10 to watch Wilbur Wright fly around the Statue of Liberty.""From then on young Trippe yearned to become an aviator,"" wrote Robert Daley in ""An American Saga: Juan Trippe and His Pan Am Empire."" ""About 17, his father sent him to the Marconi School to learn Morse code, together with what little was known about radio at the time. After that, his father sent him to the private Curtiss Flying School in Miami.""College, War, PeaceIn 1917, Trippe entered Yale, but dropped out when World War I exploded, joining the Navy to learn to pilot seaplanes. Before he could see combat, the war ended and he returned to Yale, co-founding its Aero Club and making friends with students with names like Vanderbilt and Rockefeller.Trippe's father died just before graduation in 1922, leaving a bankrupt company. The son helped pay the family bills working as a bond salesman, but was bored to death and at 24 quit to form Long Island Airways.""It was the Roaring '20s, so it was easy to raise money because flying was the high-tech startup of its time,"" said Stadiem.Trippe bought seven junked seaplanes for $500 each, stripped them and installed a more powerful motor for two passengers. The planes gave rides from beaches and flew the rich to parties, but failed to bring in enough revenue.Undaunted, Trippe organized Colonial Air Transport and landed a license to deliver mail between New York and Boston starting in 1926.Then he ordered two cutting-edge planes from famed designer Anthony Fokker. Together they flew to Cuba and convinced the country's new president to give Colonial exclusive landing rights. Since the firm's board didn't know about the trip, it fired Trippe.Undaunted still, he set up Avionics Corp. of America, which became the holding company for Pan Am. In October 1927, Pan Am delivered the first bags of mail to Havana.""Pan Am thrived on Trippe's almost clairvoyant grasp of the future, his determination to find aircraft to fit that vision, his laser eye for the small print, his discernment of talent, his ruthless extermination of competition and his stealthy lobbying for U.S. mail licenses,"" wrote Harold Evans, Gail Buckland and David Lefer in ""They Made America.""In 1928, Trippe married Elizabeth Stettinius, a relationship that produced four children.In July, Trippe announced to his staff that Pan Am would be flying mail and passengers around the Caribbean in six months.Impossible, they told an answer-ready boss:•They were stretched to the limit preparing for daily flights from Miami to Havana in two months, and what was the rush? He replied that competitors were already planning to fly to the same destinations.• How is this possible, when their Fokker planes had a range of just 100 miles? Trippe had ordered the new Sikorsky S-38.• How could they land in other countries when it would take months or years to get permission? He was working on that, backed by licenses from the Post Office.• Who wanted to fly to these exotic locations? He responded that many rich Americans would love to escape Prohibition and winter to sip rum on a beach.""Trippe exhibited exquisite patience and let everyone talk for eight hours without a break, until they began to feel ashamed,"" wrote Evans, Buckland and Lefer.Trippe was also about to unleash his secret weapon: He had recruited a radio engineer, Hugo Leuteritz, who would design transmitters and receivers so Pan Am could let its pilots fly blind.Trippe then mounted a campaign to open up Central and South America, a staggering challenge that involved bringing in construction crews by burro and canoe to hack out landing strips from jungles.""Trippe was a one-man diplomatic corps, outmaneuvering the Germans in South America and the British for trans-Atlantic routes,"" said Stadiem.Another edge was Pan Am's rigorous training. Trippe made sure mechanics and pilots had mentors to grasp every emergency. Thanks in part to that program, Pan Am completed 99% of its flights.On Top Of The MapTrippe then created Pan Am's luxury Martin M-130 Clipper planes, for which he had built airports in Hawaii, Wake, Guam and Midway to reach Asia. The first flight from San Francisco to Manila in the Philippines left in 1935, costing each of its 18 passengers $850 one way — $14,000 in today's money.He demanded that aircraft companies push plane capabilities further. Secretly, he signed a contract with Boeing (BA) for six of the planned 314 planes, which would have twice the power of the Martin and carry 77. When the board found out in 1939, it demoted Trippe for a few months, then had to restore him as World War II loomed and no one else knew how to shift gears to military transport.Pan Am would carry Allied troops for 90 million miles.After the war ended in 1945, the monopoly on international destinations for Pan Am ended, yet it was not allowed domestic routes.Trippe was so sure an explosion in mass tourism was coming, he built hotels in key cities and developed a computerized system to book airline and room reservations.The International Air Transport Association, a cartel that kept airline prices high, resisted his efforts to lower them. At a time when the minimum one-way ticket from New York to London cost $5,500 in today's money, Trippe announced a tourist-class round trip for what would be $2,600 now.By 1952, he had convinced IATA to lower prices — and demand skyrocketed.Step On ItTrippe's next revolution was the jet engine. Other airlines were happy with the new generation of turboprops and considered jets noisy, expensive and too big for many airports.Then there was Trippe. He wanted jets that could carry 180 passengers, though Boeing, Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed (LMT) were not ready to build them.He played them off against each other while pushing Pratt & Whitney to sell him its J-75 engine, which it had secretly developed for the government and which Trippe wanted to power his new aircraft.He ended up paying $269 million for 45 giant Douglas DC-8s and in 1958 inaugurated America's one-stop trans-Atlantic service. The rest of the industry scrambled to climb on the jet bandwagon.In 1966, Trippe prodded Boeing to develop the 747, which could carry 400 passengers. He paid $525 million (worth $3.8 billion now) for 25 jets and installed the new Pratt & Whitney J-75.The 747 made its maiden flight in 1970 and became the mainstay of aviation into the 21st century.Trippe startled everyone when he announced he would give up the presidency in 1968, at age 69, remaining on the board. He died 13 years later at age 81.In 1985, President Reagan awarded Trippe the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.U.S. airlines were deregulated in 1978, bringing Pan Am more international competition yet letting it acquire National Airlines for domestic routes. The merger went poorly and Pan Am went out of business in 1991.""Juan Trippe's story is a great example of the entrepreneur who follows a passion and takes big chances, no matter how unlikely,"" said leadership expert Margot Morrell, author of ""Shackleton's Way,"" ""then does the networking and management of the details to turn this dream into world-changing success.""

"
1468,LMT,"Raytheon (RTN), founded in 1922 in the shadow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been in the forefront of technology, especially defense technology, from its beginning.It invented the technology that made radio a mass product. It produced radar that helped win World War II.Among its latest products is the Zumwalt-class destroyer, a stealthy — that means it's hard to see on radar — ship that can fire missiles.Though the Zumwalt program has had problems and has been scaled back, it shows Raytheon's devotion to the most advanced defense systems.Each destroyer is 600 feet long, cruises at 30 knots and costs $3.45 billion each, $7 billion if R&D is figured in.Raytheon is in a wide spectrum of defense activities, ranging from cybersecurity and intelligence to space and missile systems.It recently delivered its 3,000th Tomahawk Block IV cruise missile to the U.S. Navy.The Aerospace/Defense industry group is ranked No. 10 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That's up from No. 30 just eight weeks ago.It includes other strong dividend-paying names such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).Earnings growth has slowed, but is remarkably stable. The three-year earnings stability factor is 2 on a scale of zero (most stable) to 99 (most volatile).In the last report, EPS dropped 1% to $1.60 a share. Analysts are forecasting a 16% decline in the next report. They expect a 7% decline in 2013, but an 8% increase in 2014.The company pays a $2.20 annual dividend, which translates to a 2.4% yield. The three- to five-year dividend growth rate is an impressive 23%.After moving sideways for years since 2010, the stock broke out of a base last April and now trades above its 10-week moving average.
"
1469,LMT,"Investors may have to wait years for some companies to pay higher dividends, but that's not the case with Lockheed Martin (LMT).The Bethesda, Md.-based firm has rewarded investors with big dividend raises for more than a decade. In late September, Lockheed bumped up its quarterly dividend by 16% to $1.33 a share from $1.15. That marked the 11th straight double-digit increase. Lockheed's quarterly dividend has more than doubled in three years.Lockheed pays a dividend of $5.32 a share on an annual basis, which works out to a yield of about 3.8%, or nearly 150 basis points higher than the S&P 500's yield. Lockheed has the second-highest yield among 27 dividend-paying stocks in the Aerospace/Defense group. The company strives to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks.While the company has delivered steady top- and bottom-line growth in recent years, it announced plans last month to cut 4,000 jobs and close factories due to slowing U.S. defense spending. Last year, sales to the U.S. government accounted for 82% of total sales. It's hoping that sales of its F-35 fighter jets to foreign buyers will help make up for the lower defense spending at home.The company's full-year earnings are expected to rise 15% to $9.68 a share this year. Growth is slated to slow to 5% in 2014.Lockheed is pulling back in light trade from a strong rebound off its 10-week line. The stock has been on a tear since breaking out from a first-stage cup-with-handle base in late March.Most of its weekly gains lately have come in above-average volume. It hasn't had a down week in heavy trade in about two months.Lockheed is one of the highest-rated stocks in the Aerospace/Defense group. Rival Northrop Grumman (NOC) is another highly rated stock in the group. It's trading tightly near an all-time high. Lockheed has a 91 Composite Rating, while Northrop has a 96.

"
1555,LMT,"The Weight Of History
"
1556,LMT,"While NASA is looking to reduce costs, the rejection of Sierra Nevada's cheaper bid and the inclusion of Boeing's pricier one also points to the space agency's other priority: reliability.
"
1557,LMT,"Boeing has worked with NASA since the dawn of the space age and has a proven track record that allowed it to command a higher sum. Its Apollo command module helped send Neil Armstrong to the moon. But Boeing's history may be weighing on its costs.
"
1558,LMT,"""Boeing's cost structure is higher than SpaceX — that's just a fact,"" said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group.
"
1559,LMT,"Because the aerospace giant has been around longer, it most likely has an older, more experienced workforce with higher wages and labor costs, he added.
"
1560,LMT,"But the biggest cost differences likely come from manufacturing processes. Boeing builds its Delta rocket and Atlas V launchers in a vertical position, while SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are assembled horizontally, which is easier and saves on time.
"
1561,LMT,"Meantime, SpaceX is a vertically integrated company, building all of its parts in-house, with no subcontractors. Boeing employs numerous subcontractors to build components, which adds to costs.
"
1562,LMT,"""When you become a more established company, you can't be a specialist in everything,"" Caceres said.
"
1563,LMT,"'Very Different Hardware'
"
1564,LMT,"SpaceX and Boeing didn't respond to questions about their cost differences. NASA said in a statement that the dollar figures awarded are for the total potential value of the contracts, including the cost of certification and the maximum value for six post-certification missions.

1565,LMT,"""Because Boeing and SpaceX are using very different hardware and are using different development, operation and management approaches, they have different prices for their respective integrated crew transportation solutions,"" NASA told IBD.
"
1566,LMT,"Cost hasn't been an issue for Boeing in the past because the government hadn't emphasized saving money until now, according to David Livingston, a professor at the University of North Dakota's School of Graduate Studies of Space.
"
1567,LMT,"Yet despite SpaceX's seeming advantage in estimated costs, the reality can be different, he pointed out.
"
1568,LMT,"""You don't know final costs because things can always crop up and delay and increase costs,"" he said. ""And you don't know operating costs until you start operating.""
"
1569,LMT,"Boeing also has something that SpaceX can't build or pay for — experience in getting a human-grade capsule into space.
"
1570,LMT,"So far, SpaceX has launched its Dragon spacecraft to the ISS only with cargo. Sending humans into space requires a more advanced system.
"
1571,LMT,"""Developing a human-rated vehicle is a complex effort,"" Caceres said. ""You have to build in redundant systems in case there is failure.""
"
1572,LMT,"Because of the complexity in building a human-grade capsule, he said that SpaceX might not meet NASA's 2017 timeline. NASA too has doubts about SpaceX.
"
1573,LMT,"Boeing received higher rankings than SpaceX in likelihood of sticking to a timetable, according to a NASA memo on the space taxi bids that the Wall Street Journal reviewed. Boeing also beat SpaceX in technical maturity and got an ""excellent"" rating for ""mission suitability"" vs. SpaceX's ""very good"" rating.

Revenue climbed 7.5% to $23.8 billion, above views for $23 billion.""Boeing's cash is tied up in inventory,"" Neal Dihora, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told IBD. ""When you deliver goods, you can take them off your balance sheet. But Boeing has chosen to increase production rates, which requires you to have more inventory.""Shares closed down 4.5%.Cash Flowing To 787In January, Boeing (BA) raised the 787 production rate to 10 per month, up from seven per month in 2013. But costs for the new fuel-efficient plane haven't fallen as expected, and CFO Greg Smith said Q3 cash flow was affected by a build-up of parts inventory for 787-9s.Operating cash flow before pension contributions fell 61% to $1.68 billion in Q3. Boeing expects ""very strong cash flow"" in Q4, but analysts aren't so sure.Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment said in a research note that he sees ""increased bear calls for higher 787 costs and lower cash flow estimates.""The production rate issue comes just weeks after Boeing announced it will boost 737 output to 52 per month in 2018 from 42 currently as narrow-body demand increases.But this summer, Air Lease (AL) President John Plueger called narrow-body production rates a ""major concern"" because suppliers are reaching their capacity, and Canaccord Genuity analysts have called such production increases unsustainable.Morningstar's Dihora said higher output could be ""borrowing from later sales"" and noted the potential for cancellations. Still, he acknowledged the industry remains healthy and that cash flow is more an issue for shareholders expecting payouts.Robust Commercial DemandBoeing secured deals for 501 new commercial aircraft in Q3, and backlog rose 11% during the quarter to $490 billion with more than 5,500 orders.Commercial airplane revenue rose 15% to $16.1 billion, though operating margins narrowed to 11.2% from 11.6% on deliveries of lower-margin 787s and 747s.The company raised its full-year EPS outlook by 20 cents to $8.10-$8.30, but the midpoint is still below the $8.28 consensus.Defense, space and security sales fell 2% to $7.9 billion amid Pentagon spending cuts.Space has been a bright spot for Boeing, which won a contract last month for NASA's space taxi program to take astronauts to the International Space Station along with Elon Musk's SpaceX.Also on Wednesday, General Dynamics (GD) reported quarterly earnings that topped estimates as aerospace sales, which include its Gulfstream business jet and Jet Aviation units, rose 6.4% to $2.3 billion. But overall revenue missed.The business jet industry took a hit during the recession, but earlier this week Honeywell (HON) forecast global deliveries of up to 9,450 new business jets from 2014 to 2024, up from a prior forecast of 9,250.Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported earnings and revenue that beat estimates and raised its full-year EPS outlook.Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q3 EPS that topped analyst estimates, but its sales fell below views and it sees 2015 sales declining.

1603,LMT,"AeroVironment (AVAV) won a $19 million Pentagon contract to develop a phase II design for a new class of maritime surveillance drone, as the Navy prepares to seek bids for larger carrier-based drones.As part of the contract announced Wednesday, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Office of Naval Research are looking to improve surveillance and strike capabilities using ""smaller ships as mobile launch and recovery sites for medium-altitude long-endurance"" drones, AeroVironment said.Under the year-long award, the drone maker will develop a preliminary design, leading up to a flight demonstration before a planned phase III award decision.Shares of the company edged up 0.1% in the stock market today.Meanwhile, the Navy is preparing to ask for bids on larger drones that can take off and land on aircraft carriers. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA) and General Atomics are expected to compete for that award.As the defense sector ramps up development of unmanned aircraft, the commercial use of drones in the U.S. is starting to take off as well. The FAA is generating protocols for their use in domestic airspace, but has already granted licenses for the use of drones in Alaskan oilfields and for Hollywood movie production.In June, AeroVironment's Puma AE drone became the first unmanned aircraft to provide commercial services over U.S. soil, when it was used by BP (BP) at its Prudhoe Bay field.

1724,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently won a $175.3-million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning depot implementation plan for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the terms, Lockheed Martin will provide development, testing and activation services for thirteen different F-35 component repair capabilities in support of the implementation plan. The modification includes 46.9% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 23.5% for the U.S. Navy, 23.5% for the U.S. Marine Corps and 6.1% for the non-DoD participants.Work related to the deal will be performed in Nashua, NH; Torrance, CA; Fort Worth, TX and other various locations across the United States. The tasks are expected to get completed by November 2021. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) and non-DoD funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ProgramThe F-35 Lightning is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, which represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability, offering enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars. It is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide, largely due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support and powerful integrated sensors capabilities.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total consolidated net sales in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, higher sales at Aeronautics, primarily attributable to higher sales registered for the F-35 program and increased volume on F-35 sustainment activities during the same time frame, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. In June itself, the company secured a deal worth $736 million to support the F-35 Lightning II program and a contract worth $503 million for providing air vehicle initial spare parts in support of the F-35 program. Considering the frequent order inflows, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners, overseas customers and rising demand on a global scale.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.7% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Textron and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In fact, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program, being Lockheed Martin’s leading project, generated 24% of the company’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program led to the Aeronautics segment’s revenue growth of 7% year over year to $4.4 billion.Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s largest contractor, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either.

1726,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Aeronautics, recently clinched a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for manufacturing 16 F-16 V Block 70 aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Sep 30, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $1.1 billion, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Per the terms of the agreement, the F-16 jets will be delivered to the Kingdom of Bahrain.The production will be carried out in Greenville, SC; and Fort Worth, TX. Lockheed Martin will utilize FMS funds to complete the order.A Brief Note on F-16Originally manufactured by General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), F-16 became part of Lockheed Martin after it acquired the former’s aircraft manufacturing business. The combat-proven F-16 falcon is a multi-role fighter jet, which currently serves 28 nations. As an F-16 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin is uniquely qualified to design, engineer, develop, integrate and sustain a complete F-16 weapons system to meet customer requirements.Over the decades, the F-16 falcon has evolved from a day-only lightweight jet to all-weather multi-role fighter. The F-16V Block 70 is the newest and most advanced generation of the F-16 fleet. Its superiority over the earlier F-16 models lies in its advanced APG-83 AESA radar.Notably, Northrop Grumman’s (NOC  -  Free Report) APG-83 radar provides F-16s with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities, which allow better detection and tracking ranges, multiple target track as well as high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) maps for all-environment precision strike.Foreign Military Sales: A Key Catalyst Apart from enjoying a strong foothold in domestic markets, Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven jets are also well acclaimed internationally. In March 2017, the U.S. administration declared that it will go forward with the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Bahrain worth $5 billion. Earlier, the deal was stalled by the Obama Administration owing to the human rights concerns. This go-ahead gave a huge boost to the F-16 product line’s growth.Meanwhile, realizing the expanding defense market in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions lately, Lockheed Martin inked a landmark deal with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) in June 2017. Per the contract, both the companies will jointly manufacture Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Block 70 fighter jets in India. We believe this deal to be an important strategic move by the defense prime to substantially expand its foothold in the market of India — the world’s largest military weapons importer. Thus, reflecting the increased demand for Lockheed Martin’s F-16 model overseas.Moreover, the United States considers Bahrain as its important partner in this region, given the prevailing socio-political tensions in the Middle East. This is quite evident from the last year’s deal. Moreover, in May 2018, the U.S. State Department approved Bahrain’s purchase of 3,200 bomb bodies to arm its fleet of F-16 fighters. This, in turn, is expected to bolster the Royal Bahraini Air Force’s ability to conduct and sustain air operations with its F-16 combat aircraft, which is expected to get yet another boost with the latest contract win.For Lockheed Martin, aircraft deal wins like the latest one, should substantially drive its Aeronautics division’s sales. In the first quarter of 2018, this segment witnessed a 7% year-over-year improvement in sales and can be expected to exhibit similar performance moving ahead, based on aforementioned developments.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Lockheed Martin has gained about 6.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically and internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Pick    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Boeing came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 29.51% in the trailing four quarters.

1727,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Missile and Fire Control (MFC) business division recently won a $364.6 million contract for Army Tactical Guided Missile and Launching Assembly Service Life Extension program. The deal was awarded under the domestic and foreign military sales program.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms, the company will deliver the missiles and extension programs to the Romanian Army.Work related to the deal will be performed in Dallas, TX; Boulder, CO; Clearwater, FL; Cincinnati, OH and various other locations across the United States. The tasks are expected to get completed in Mar 26, 2020. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation; foreign military sales; overseas contingency operation and aircraft procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on Army Tactical Missile SystemThe Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a conventional surface-to-surface artillery weapon system capable of striking targets well beyond the range of existing Army cannons, rockets and other missiles. The ATACMS long-range guided missiles are fired from the MLRS M270 and M270A1 weapons platform.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s MFC unit acquired several major orders in the second quarter of 2018. The segment was successful in clinching contracts worth $282 million for supporting PAC-3 missiles, $279 million for the delivery of PAC-3 missiles, and $200 million for upgrading THAAD and PATRIOT missiles.Inevitably, such massive order inflows for its missile programs tend to fuel the company’s top-line growth. Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1.7 billion, which reflected a healthy 8% improvement from the year-ago quarter. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost MFC’s revenue growth in the days to come, as well.Moreover, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, being a prominent missile supplier for the U.S. Army and its overseas clients, is expected to gain significantly from this provision.Furthermore, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Given this huge opportunity for expansion, frequent contract wins from Pentagon for its various missiles, including the latest one, will allow Lockheed Martin to further enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.1% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 30.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Textron and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1728,LMT,"On Monday, Jun 18, President Donald Trump expressed his desire and eagerness to take America to the top spot in the space race once again. He noted that the country’s commercial space industry has been enterprising, when it comes to breaking new ground in space exploration.Further, NASA also published a report on Jun 20 about how it plans to defend the earth from asteroid attacks. The report also states that the space agency could use the government’s help in such pursuits. Major space and defense stocks have rallied since such developments. Investors could seize such an opportunity to rake in some gains by investing in defense and space stocks.Trump Vows to Dominate SpaceThe space race seems to have fizzled out in the sense that human expeditions are few and far to come by. This stems from the fact that governments have been reluctant in sending humans to the space because of the risks involved and the huge amount of money associated to such expeditions.Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump spoke extensively about how he planned to make America the top power in space. He also vowed to “reclaim” for his country, with the help of his team, the United States’ “heritage as the world's greatest space-faring nation.”He further stated that he wants the United States to lead explorations on Moon and Mars, essentially leaving Russia and China behind. He aspires to create a sixth branch of American military, which he termed as the “space force.”There have been decades of contemplation regarding the creation of the U.S. Space Corps, with the most recent effort being in 2017. The U.S. House Armed Services Committee even drafted a bill for the corps under the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.NASA’s Report to the U.S. Government On Wednesday, NASA along with a few federal officials published a report on the approach that the United States should take in the coming years to protect our plant from a spate of asteroid attacks. The 18-page report, has been termed ""The National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan."" The agenda seeks contribution from different departments within the federal government.Officials from the White House have gone on record to say that Trump’s “space force” might be used extensively in such pursuits. Trump’s space ambitions can possibly be used to fund deep space explorations in the future. Investments channeled properly for such ambitious expeditions can be used in the future.Such developments actually led to a surge in space and defense stocks. The Space Index (^SPACE) which tracks companies engaged in space and related activities has rallied approximately 1.2% since Trump’s speech. The index constitutes some of the major players from the sector, the likes of which include Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (AJRD  -  Free Report) and Viasat  to name a few.4 Best ChoicesSince his election, Trump has vowed to get Americans back to space in a bid to reclaim the top spot in space race. Further, NASA’s commitment to safeguard the earth from celestial rocks has provided the necessary impetus for further investments in such projects.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is the owner and operator of a defense and aerospace company.

1729,LMT,"While a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon and the fiscal 2019 defense budget sanction by the U.S. Senate on June 19 boosted the U.S. aerospace and defense industry, the escalating trade dispute between America and China created a major upheaval in the entire stock market.  Concerns that the dispute might grow more intense and drag down global economic growth, spooked investors worldwide.  Therefore, a sudden sell-off was witnessed in the global stock market, which in turn overweighed the positive impact of the U.S. Senate’s approval for fiscal 2019 budget. This induced a decline in share price of major U.S. defense contractors in the trailing five trading sessions. Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — decreased 4%, respectively, in the same period.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) — secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. American Outdoor Brands Corp. (AOBC  -  Free Report) also released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Boeing won a $1.52 billion contract to provide system configuration sets and associated services for life-cycle upgrading of the F/A-18A/B, C/D, E/F and EA-18G aircraft. The deal will cater to the U.S. Navy and foreign military sales (FMS) customers. Work related to the contract is expected to be completed in June 2023.Per the terms of the agreement, Boeing will provide deliverables and services such as FMS unique system configuration sets, system improvement and demonstration products, laboratory upgrades, and studies and analysis.

1730,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics division recently won a $503.2 million modification contract for providing air vehicle initial spare parts in support of the F-35 program. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide initial spares that include F-35 Lightning II deployment spares packages, afloat spares packages and associated consumables. The spare parts would be used for supporting air vehicle delivery schedules for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants.The modification includes 21% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 14% for the U.S. Navy, 18% for the U.S. Marine Corps and 47% for the non-DoD participants.Work related to the deal will be performed in Fort Worth, TX; Samlesbury and Cheltenham, the United Kingdom; Papendrect, The Netherlands and various other locations across the United States. The tasksare expected to get completed in December 2023. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy) and non-DoD participant funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Lightning II JetThe F-35 Lightning is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, which represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability offering enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars.The F-35 jet is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide, largely due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support and powerful integrated sensors capabilities. Looking ahead, the program’s domain is expected to witness a robust expansion across the globe.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program, during the same time frame, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. Recently, the company secured a contract worth $736 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 13th and 14th lot. Considering the frequent order inflows along with the latest one, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners and rising international demands. Such projected estimations will certainly lead to an increase in the production of air vehicle spares and associated consumables for this aircraft.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, announced by Trump this February, provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, going ahead, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 9.9% in the last one year compared with the industry’s growth of 34.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1731,LMT,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1732,LMT,"The play of mixed factors has kept U.S. defense stocks afloat in the five trailing trading sessions, with limited upside in sight. While a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon and completion of the mega merger between Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK boosted the U.S. aerospace and defense industry, the denuclearization deal at Singapore’s summit marred the expected growth rate.In particular, shares of major U.S. defense contractors declined on Jun 12 following a conflict-free settlement of the denuclearization deal. Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — inched up 0.6% in the last five trading sessions.Moreover, defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Also, Northrop Grumman’s Orbital ATK acquisition for $9.2 billion hit the headlines last week.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Boeing secured an $862.2 million modification contract for providing full-rate production of fifteen Lot 42 F/A-18E and three F/A-18F aircraft to the U.S Navy. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Majority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, St. Louis, MI and the rest would be performed in various locations across the United States. Work related to the deal is expected to be completed in June 2020 (read more: Boeing Wins $862M Navy Deal for the F/A 18 Aircraft).2. Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics division won a $735.7 million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning II program.

1733,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract for the procurement of Technical Insertion 18/20 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) insertion systems, pre-cable kits and spares. It will also provide production support services. The deal includes options, which, if exercised, will bring its cumulative value to $433 million.Details of the DealValued at $22.8 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, and Clearwater, FL, while the rest will be executed in Syracuse, NY and Marion, FL.Lockheed Martin will have to complete the work by May 2024.About A-RCI SystemsA-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines. A-RCI uses a progression of technology insertions (TI) to enhance sonar signal processing which helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments, without being counter-detected. Additionally, it facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions as well as under-ice operations.Reasons Behind Lockheed’s SelectionSince late 90’s, Lockheed Martin’s introduction of the A-RCI Sonar Systems has been a very effective introduction to its product portfolio, offering improved acoustic quieting measures at reasonable costs. Ever since its inception, it has successfully been able to upgrade the system multiple times, which is extensively preferred in U.S. submarine fleets.Inevitably, Lockheed Martin has successfully been selected by the US. Department of Defense for contracts related to A-RCI Systems.Further, Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems segment, which designs and manufactures the A-RCI Sonar Systems, generated revenues of $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting almost 27.5% of its total revenues, led by higher sales for its integrated warfare systems and sensors programs along with (C6ISR) programs.Budget Revision – Lockheed’s GainLockheed Martin, being the Pentagon’s largest and prime defense contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts to its credit. In line with this, President Trump’s recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for an investment plan of $13.5 billion, which also includes $1.7 billion for the procurement of 43 AEGIS Combat Systems. Evidently, such provisions reflect solid growth prospects for the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems segment, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin going ahead.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 13.1% in the last one year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 40.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1735,LMT,"On Jul 12, President Donald Trump in Brussels said that NATO allies have agreed to raise their defense spending to 2% of their GDP by 2024. The President further claimed that the NATO allies have committed to increase their military spending by an unprecedented amount and that many countries have agreed to reach that number sooner.However, Trump’s claims of a number of allies agreeing to raise their defense spending beyond 2% were denied by French president Emmanuel Macron. Macron said that the allies have confirmed the goal of raising their military spending to 2% by 2024.That said, Trump claimed victory in his efforts to convince the European allies to raise their defense spending. This saw a rally in defense stocks on Thursday, thus leading to a rebound in the markets that have been reeling under trade war fears. Given this scenario, it makes sense to add defense stocks to your portfolio at this point.Trump Claims Victory at NATOThe issue of increasing defense spending has been a major point of contention between the United States and other members of the 29-member block. However, on Thursday morning, Trump said that the NATO allies have committed to raising their spending on defense to 2% of their GDP by 2024. NATO allies had made the pledge in 2014 but Trump claimed that many could reach that goal sooner.However, Macron denied Trump’s claims saying that the goal remains the same as it was in 2014, that of reaching the 2% target defense spending by 2024. Interestingly, on Wednesday, Trump came up with the idea that the members of the bloc should up their defense spending to 4% of their GDP.This initiated an emergency meeting among NATO allies on Thursday morning. However, in the evening, Trump said that the members would first reach the goal of 2% and only then talks of higher contribution would be initiated. Besides the United States, only four members — United Kingdom, Greece, Poland and Estonia — contribute 2% of their GDP to defense spending.NATO Summit Becomes a Tense AffairThe NATO summit was a tense affair this time around, with Trump criticizing a number of countries for not raising their defense spending. Germany particularly was subject to Trump’s acquisitions. Currently, Germany spends only 1.1% of its GDP on defense although it had pledged to increase it to 1.5% by 2025 in May.Reportedly, on the first day of the summit, Trump openly accused Germany of being controlled by Russia, as a number of oil and gas deals have given Moscow far more influence over Berlin. However, both Germany and Russia have denied such accusations.Moreover, according to reports, Trump has made an informal suggestion to the NATO allies that they should double their defense spending from 2% to 4%. Understandably, Trump feels that the United States gets a bad deal from its allies. However, Trump claimed this to be a victory in convincing the NATO allies to reach their 2% goal by 2024, which saw defense stocks jumping on Thursday.     Our Choices The NATO summit was quite a charged-up affair at a time when U.S-Europe relations have already been soured by a trade spat. Now, increased spending on defense would mean greater demand for defense equipment, and more revenues for its players. So, it makes sense to add defense stocks to your investment arsenal at this point.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (CVU  -  Free Report) CPI Aerostructures, Inc. comprises two distinct entities: CPI Aerostructures, Inc. and Kolar, Inc.

1736,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently won a $28.6 million contract for modernizing the B-2 stealth bomber defense management system. The contract was awarded by the Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, OK.Work related to the deal will be performed in Owego, NY and is expected to be completed by Jul 9, 2020. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 working capital funds for completing the task.Brief Note on B-2 Defense Management System OverhaulThe B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization/Overhaul (DMS-M) program maintains the B-2 direct attack capability while addressing emerging threats from enemy air defenses. DMS-M program upgrades the Electronic Support measures, antennas and display processing units. From a broader perspective, the B-2 DMS-M provides the B-2 fleet with advanced situational awareness, improved supportability, enhanced lethality, increased platform survivability and networked battle-space awareness. The prime contractor for the U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), which uses Lockheed Martin’s B-2 DMS-M program.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) unit is engaged in providing design, service and support for a variety of mission systems, and radar sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. We believe the latest system modernization deal will enable the segment to technologically improve other sensor-based programs offered by the company.Steady and regular order inflows tend to fuel RMS segment’s top-line growth. Notably, the company’s RMS segment recorded first-quarter 2018 sales of $3.2 billion, reflecting a 3% improvement from the year-ago quarter on account of higher sales for its sensor and C6ISR programs. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost RMS’s revenue growth in the days to come, as well.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.8% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report) and Engility Holdings (EGL  -  Free Report).While Wesco Aircraft Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Engility Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1737,LMT,"To everyone’s surprise the first-ever formal meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un in Singapore was extremely successful. While the eco-political consequence of signing the denuclearization agreement at this historical meeting was a constructive one, hinting at a peace regime across the Korean peninsula, it does not bode well for the U.S. defense industry.Major U.S. defense contractors paid the price, witnessing a sudden downfall in their stocks on Tuesday, since a settlement of the long-standing conflict between these two nations may lower demand for weaponries from these contractors.Crux of the Denuclearization DealPresident Trump and Chairman Jong-Un signed an agreement at yesterday’s historical summit that aimed at averting any major military confrontation between the two nations, at least in the near term. The two primary aspects of the agreement were Kim’s renewed commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump’s promise to pull out thousands of troops stationed in South Korea.While the minute details of the deal were not made public, in a press conference, Trump announced that as part of the deal America will end joint military drill with South Korea against North Korea and eventually withdraw troops from the Korean Peninsula.Defense Stocks That Took a BeatingFrequent cross-border altercations between the United States and North Korea were one of the primary driving forces behind defense stocks’ rally last year. Indeed, major U.S. defense contractors, especially the ones that manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services, hit all-time highs, following the countering missile-test war between these two nations.Naturally, the signing of the denuclearization deal, hinting at easing of tensions between Pyongyang and Washington, sent the following defense stocks lower.Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) provides systems, products and solutions to government and commercial customers in the areas of aerospace, mission systems and technology services worldwide. Its cyber solutions offer missile warning and defense systems. Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.The company’s shares have lost 1.5% since the news of denuclearization surfaced. Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is one of the largest aerospace and defense companies in the United States with a diversified line of military products, including missiles, radars, sensors, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, communication and information systems, naval systems, air traffic control systems and technical services. Its notable missile system includes the Tomahawk cruise missile, an advanced surface or submarine-launched cruise missile with loitering and network communication capability. Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares have lost 2.8% since the announcement. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is the largest defense contractor in the world, which manufactures military aircraft, Joint Light Tactical vehicle, Littoral combat ships and many more alike defense equipment. Among its varied missile programs, notable ones are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company’s shares lost 1.3% in the last trading session. General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) is a prominent military shipbuilder and is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. It manufactures combat-proven missile destroyer ships, missile submarines as well as tactical missile aerostructures. General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The company’s shares lost 1.6% following the announcement. Will the Deal Really Jeopardize Defense Growth?While the signing of the denuclearization deal has adversely impacted defense stocks, the effect will wane over time. After all, United States’ cross-border tension with North Korea was not the sole driver of U.S. defense stocks.Factors like expansionary U.S. budgetary amendments under Trump administration along with rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India have boosted investors’ optimism in the U.S. defense industry. Also, owing to regional tensions in the Middle East, U.S. defense majors have been increasingly receiving contracts from countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which are boosting international sales. In fact, the aforementioned defense primes have been witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions even before the U.S-North Korea tension escalated, thanks to intrinsic strength of their diverse product portfolio. Moreover, analysts are skeptical about the viability of the deal over the long term. This is because North Korea had made similar commitments in the past but continued to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, following the summit, Trump said that there is no surety that there will not be a reversal of situation in another six months or so, owing to which he may act against Jong-Un. This keeps the doors open for defense majors to regain momentum. We believe signing of the deal is a small step toward maintaining peace between these two nations. Verification and monitoring will be necessary to ensure that North Korea has actually put down its nuclear weapons. For this, the U.S. government will have to rely on its defense contractors. So, all’s not lost for the U.S. defense majors.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1738,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics division recently won a $735.7 million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning II program. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MI.Details of the DealPer the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide material and equipment for the low rate initial production (LRIP) of the 13th and 14th lots of F-35 jets. The material and equipment would be provided, following the completion of formal hardware qualification testing.Additionally, the contract will offer long-lead time materials, parts and components to support the LRIP of F-35’s 13th lot.  The modification includes 49% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 26% for the U.S. Navy and 25% for the U.S. Marine Corps.Majority of work related to the deal will be performed in Fort Worth, TX; El Segundo, CA, and Warton, the U.K, while the rest will be executed in Nagoya, Japan and other various locations across the United States. It is expected to get completed by December 2019.The company will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Lightning JetThe F-35 Lightning, which is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability that offers enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars.Due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support, and powerful integrated sensors capabilities, the F-35 jet is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide. Looking ahead, the program’s domain is expanding notably around the globe.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program, during the same quarter, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of fiscal 2018 has not been any exception either. In May, the company secured a contract worth $558 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 11th lot. Considering the frequent order inflows, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners and rising international demands.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, announced by Trump this February, provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 15.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s gain of 42.9%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.

1739,LMT,"The global stock market continues to stagger as the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China gains steam. The escalating trade dispute has already hit the U.S. economy, with punitive duties now in place for steel and aluminum and the White House threatening auto import tariffs.With no drastic near-term improvement expected in the US-China trade relations, investors continue to remain skeptical about the equity market’s growth. This has been reflected in the aerospace and defense stocks’ performance over the past five trading sessions, which failed to rally in spite of witnessing a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Evidently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — declined 5.3%, respectively, in the last five trading sessions.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) — secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Moreover, L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) completed its Vertex Aerospace divestiture.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for June 29, 2018 here)Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Bell-Boeing, a joint venture (JV) between Boeing and Bell Helicopter — a unit of Textron — secured a modification contract worth $4.2 billion in relation to V-22 aircraft.

1740,LMT,"The global stock market took a hit last week following the U.S. President’s proposal of an imposition of a 24% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tax on aluminum imports.Though Trump’s decision is aimed at keeping a check on foreign imports and boost jobs in the country, possibility of a global trade war stemming from the same provided a severe jolt to the share market. In fact, post the declaration, many companies’ share price (except steel and aluminum makers) slumped on Mar 1 on the fear of reeling under higher prices for inputs.Why Should the Aerospace Majors Worry?Aluminum and steel are the basic raw materials required for the manufacturing of aircraft as well as other defense products like rockets, missiles, tankers to name a few.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, operational aluminum smelters in the United States have declined from 23 in 1993 to five in 2018. Per a Commerce Department report only one of these smelters make the high-purity aluminum needed for fighter jets.Aircraft manufacturers as well as defense majors rely on foreign imports to develop high-end weaponries.  Per a report by The Washington Post, U.S. companies import 90% of aluminum that is needed to manufacture products as diverse as beer cans and fighter jets.However, steel, in the United States, is used to a much lesser extent by Aerospace companies, when compared to aluminum. Per The New York Timer, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel required for manufacturing jets and defense equipment.Therefore, the imposition is likely to have a significant impact on the major players in the U.S. Aerospace & Defense space.Implication of the Tariff: Experts ViewThe U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis supported Trump’s decision. However, he is of the opinion that the move should come through a system of targeted tariffs and import curbs on aluminum can be put on hold for now.He added that direct defense needs account for only about 3% of U.S. production. The proposed curbs will not dent Pentagon’s ability to obtain steel and aluminum needed to meet national defense requirements.However, the Aerospace Industries Association believes that the imposition might lead to a marketplace retaliation and has thus extended a critical review of the tariff plan. In particular, its CEO believes that the tariff will adversely impact the Aerospace-Defense space by raising costs and disrupting supply chains, putting the U.S. global competitiveness at risk. According to him, the U.S. aerospace and defense industry generates more than $86-billion net surplus a year — the highest in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the tariff, if imposed, will surely affect the industry and in turn the economy.     Trump’s latest announcement has not gone down well with the foreign allies of the nation. The European Union has already announced plans to impose higher tariffs on Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans, if this tax comes into effect.Stocks in FocusFollowing Trump’s announcement, Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) stock fell almost 4%, The Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) stock declined 3.5% and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) shares dipped 1.4% on Mar 1.Aluminum is one of the three most important raw materials that Boeing requires for the manufacturing of aerospace products.  According to several experts, the company uses aluminum for the manufacturing 80% of older models like 737 and 777 which accounts for 12% of the cost. However, most of the aluminum Boeing uses is domestically produced and only around 25-30% is imported. So the tariff may hike the cost of a plane by 0.3%. On the other hand, many fear that prices of domestic aluminum is likely to rise if the tariff is imposed and in turn weigh on the company’s sales.Moreover, with Boeing operating a diverse business globally, Bloomberg believes that it remains most susceptible to a possible trade war as a result of this tariff.For Lockheed Martin as well, aluminum is an important raw material. The company’s CEO remains concerned over the impact of the proposed tax on the company’s growth. The company, which relies on sales to foreign allies, remains worried because Trump’s latest plan could hamper those relationships as well as lead to marketplace retaliation.Meanwhile, Lockheed is likely to clinch a long-term purchase agreement which would cushion it against the proposed US steel and aluminum tariff until 2021 (per the Financial Times).On Mar 2, the governor of Virginia warned that Trump's plans to impose tariffs on steel imports will hurt defense shipyards like Newport News, which is building America's next class of aircraft carriers. This in turn may adversely impact shipbuilders like General Dynamics. ConclusionThe primary objective of the tariff imposition is to create jobs for Americans, yet there remains a fallacy in the policy itself. While American steelmakers lost “three-quarters of their jobs” between 1962 and 2005, a major study by the American Economic Association revealed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold. Thus, declining domestic demand was not the prime reason for the rising unemployment rate. So the latest tariff now will most likely not boost the domestic job market to the extent that Trump expects.Despite this, if it is imposed the aerospace defense stocks will be affected, at least in the initial days. This is because that not only it will make imported steel and aluminum dearer, but also will push up the cost of its domestic counterparts, putting these stocks at a competitive disadvantage compared to their foreign peers. Yet, considering the fact that America is the largest supplier of defense equipments, the major players in this industry including those mentioned above are expected to turn around in the long run.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1741,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a contract worth $558.3 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 11th lot. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by February 2023.Majority of the task will be performed in Orlando, FL; while the rest will be executed in Redondo Beach, CA; Fort Worth, TX; Owego, NY and Samlesbury, United Kingdom.Details of the DealThe deal has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will provide sustainment support, which includes equipment, training devices, training facilities, non-aircraft spares, Autonomic Logistics Information System hardware and software support along with facilities standup.The contract will cater to the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participant and foreign military sales (“FMS”) customers. The deal includes 31% of the work for the Air Force; 11% for the Marine Corps, 9% for the Navy, 42% for the non-DoD participants and 7% for international military customers.Fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 aircraft procurement funds (Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, non-DoD participant) and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the task.F-35 Lightning II AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft that comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused advanced sensor information, weapons capacity and range, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.The F-35’s ability to collect, analyze and share data is a powerful force multiplier enhancing all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battle space and enabling military personnel to effectively execute combat  missions. In fact, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program, being Lockheed Martin’s largest project, generated 24% of the company’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program, in the first quarter, enabled the company’s Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. In April, the company secured a contract worth $211 million for offering Block 4.1 common capabilities pre-modernization efforts to support the preliminary design review of F-35 Lightning II jets.  Considering such order inflows along with the latest one, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners and rising international demands.Furthermore, President Trump’s recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program going ahead, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 15.1% in the past one year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 41.2%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (WAIR  -  Free Report).

1742,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently clinched a contract in relation to F-35 jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Details of the DealValued at $14.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the deal, the company will offer emerging capabilities and analysis systems engineering to include programmatic and logistics tasks. These efforts will analyze the F-35 air system's ability to meet future operational requirements, investigate cost and weight reduction program options, and conduct modeling and simulation activities.The contract also include provisions for additional assessments such as analyzing changes to design life, operational readiness, reliability, and air system design and configuration.  Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully-fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. While, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics earlier condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft alongside its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 15.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 41.7%.

1743,LMT,"Trade war fears between the United States and its trading partners have been rife since March. Trump’s announcement in early March that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports first spooked the market.The situation eased a little when Trump administration granted a temporary relief from tariffs to some of its key allies like European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea. However, China was not part of that exemption and a tussle over trade with China has been going on since March (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Trump's Tariff Exemptions).Trump Flip-Flops on Trade United States and China announced a $50-billion import tariff on each other, only to put the war “on hold” for a while. Then again, at May-end, Washington announced a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China and imposed new limits on Chinese investments in the United States (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Plus, tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico will be put into effect from Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products.Retaliations in Cue Mexico has already retaliated by levying measures on U.S. farm and industrial products, targeting pork legs, apples, grapes and cheeses. Investors should note that about 22% of U.S. pork is exported out of which Mexico buys the maximum.Canada plans to slam retaliatory tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. exports and contest the steel and aluminum tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), per Reuters. The EU is also planning a legal challenge via the WTO.Against this backdrop, we highlight some industries that could be impacted the most by the tariffs.Food and Meat Producers The S&P 500 Packaged Foods and Meats index shed about 2% on the retaliation news, per Reuters. A professor of agricultural economics at Purdue expects this tariff along with supply glut in the meat market to cause average losses for U.S. hog farmers of about $9 per animal in 2018 and $13 in 2019. No wonder, Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, lost about 4.3% on May 31 on Mexico’s tit-for-tat tariff announcement.  Food and beverage companies like Kraft Heinz Company KHC (down 2.3% on May 31) and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL (down 3.4% on May 31) also featured in the losers’ list.Consumer Staples ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF FTXG, First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (FXG  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF MOO and PowerShares Dynamic Food and Beverage (PBJ  -  Free Report) and S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples Portfolio (RHS  -  Free Report) have exposure to the afore-mentioned companies and could thus be hit hard.Semiconductor U.S. chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China. So, renewed tariff tensions with China could bring back pain in the semiconductor space. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down about 0.7% on May 31 (read: 4 Best Performing Sector ETFs of May).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) (down 1.7%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) (down 1.9%) may come under pressure.Also, China is a key market for Boeing where it serves as the largest exporter of America. So, any tension with China doesn’t bode well for Boeing. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to higher input costs for Hershey Company HSY (down 1.7%) and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ (down 0.9%).BeerImported aluminum is used to make beer cans. Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) (down 1.1%) and Constellation Brands Inc. STZ) (down 0.8%) may face the rising cost issue. At the same time, the announcement puts Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF  in focus.Auto Both steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would drive the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Also, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports. All these put First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) in an edgy spot (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1745,LMT,"President Trump fired U.S. Secretary of State — Rex Tillerson — on Mar 13, by announcing his decision on Twitter. Consequently, stocks in the aerospace and defense space were on an upward trajectory in pre-market trading.Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) gained 0.74%, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) inched up 0.31%, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) rose 0.21% and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) was up 0.54%, per a report by The Street.What Went Wrong With Tillerson?Tillerson’s short tenure of a year was marked by multiple public disagreements with President Trump over diverse foreign policy decisions. In fact, the discord between these two administrative stalwarts reached to such an extent that Tillerson called Trump a “moron” in a Pentagon meeting in July 2017.Notably, both Trump and Tillerson repeatedly clashed over multiple administrative agendas like — whether to stay in the Paris climate change accord, how to aggressively back the embargo against Qatar led by Saudi Arabia or whether to pursue a diplomatic solution to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.Reportedly, Tillerson also expressed displeasure regarding Trump’s widely criticized response to a neo-Nazi protest in August 2017, which had led to a death in Charlottesville, VA. Their rift emerged more sharply when Trump tweeted in October that Tillerson is ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programs. Markedly, Tillerson was among Trump's deputies who tried to prevent him from taking steps to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.These frequent discords led analysts to anticipate Tillerson’s departure in past few months. Now that the nation’s commander-in-chief has finally made the decision, the rocky tenure of America’s top diplomat have come to an end.How Will Tillerson’s Exit Aid Defense Stocks?Trump has suggested the name of Mike Pompeo, the CIA chief as the next secretary of state, following Tillerson’s exit.Interestingly, Mike Pompeo is a hard-line Republican who shares Trump’s combatant perspective of the world. Moreover, Pompeo was an outspoken critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and Hillary Clinton's handling of the Benghazi attack. He also criticized the former National Security Agency leaker — Edward Snowden — as a traitor and wished for his death sentence.It is interesting to note that Trump’s presidency has already proved to be a boon for defense stocks, thanks to his optimistic defense-related strategies. On top of that, arrival of a combat-friendly diplomat like Pompeo serves as good news for the defense industry and thus has boosted the stocks post the news release.  Other Factors Boosting Defense StocksThere’s no denying of the fact that Trump’s presidency has proved conducive to the U.S. Aerospace and Defense space, when it was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. The latest fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal depicts also depicts a favorable picture for the industry. The proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security. Of the total, $686.1 billion is being kept as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial fiscal 2018 President’s budget.Apart from the budget factor, a wave of mergers has been observed between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition as well as expand core operations and product lines.

1746,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $282-million modification contract for providing post production support to the Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by May 19, 2019.The contract includes domestic and foreign military sales to Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and South Korea.The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Locations for carrying out tasks and funding will be determined with each order.A Brief Note on PAC-3 Missile SystemThe PAC-3 missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.Per Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor has a two-pulse solid rocket motor that boosts altitude and range. The company anticipates that demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones in the first quarter of 2018. For instance, following the U.S. and Polish officials’ agreement in the first quarter, under which Poland became Lockheed Martin’s fifth international PAC-3 MSE customer, PAC-3 MSE interceptors will support Poland's WISLA Air and Missile Defense system. Moreover, in February 2018, the company won a $524-million contract for the production of PAC-3 enhancement missiles.Inevitably, such massive order inflows for its PAC-3 missiles and interceptors tend to fuel the company’s top-line growth.  Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control segment, which produces the PAC-3defense missiles and interceptors, recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1.7 billion, reflecting a healthy 8% improvement from the year-ago quarter. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost MFC’s revenue growth in second quarter as well.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, being a prominent missile supplier for the U.S. Army, is expected to gain significantly from this provision.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 15.3% in the past one year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 38.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (WAIR  -  Free Report). While AeroVironment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AeroVironment recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 147.43% in the past four quarters. The company’s long-term growth rate is pegged at 20%.Boeing recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 29.51% in the past four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose by 66 cents to $14.61 in the past 90 days.Wesco Aircraft Holdings long-term growth rate is pegged at 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose by 10 cents to 77 cents in the past 90 days.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1747,LMT,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is LMT due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Lockheed Beats on Q1 Earnings, Raises '18 GuidanceLockheed Martin reported first-quarter 2018 earnings from continuing operations of $4.02 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35 by 20%. The earnings figure also came in higher than the year-ago figure of $2.69 per share, by 49%.Operational HighlightsIn the reported quarter, total revenues came in at $11.64 billion surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.30 billion by 2.9%. The top line was also up 3.8% from $11.21 billion a year ago. Notably, all segments registered year-over-year growth in sales, except Space Systems.BacklogPentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin, ended the first quarter (on Mar 25, 2018) with $104.8 billion in backlog, down 0.7% from $105.5 billion at the end of first-quarter 2017. Of this, the Aeronautics segment accounted for $35.1 billion while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $30.1 billion. Also, $21.5 billion came from Space Systems and $18 billion from Missiles and Fire Control.Segmental PerformanceAeronautics: Revenues at this segment increased 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. The improvement was primarily driven by higher net sales from the F-35 program on account of increased production and sustainment volume. Increased net sales for other combat aircraft modernization programs backed by volume expansion also boosted the segment’s top line.While operating profit advanced 8% year over year to $474 million, operating margin expanded 10 bps to 10.8%.Missiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales rose 8% year over year to $1.7 billion owing to higher net sales for increased volume on classified programs as well as tactical missiles programs backed by increased volume.Operating profit improved 12% year over year to $261 million, while operating margin expanded 50 bps to 15.6%.Rotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly sales of $3.2 billion grew 3% on account of higher sales for training and logistics solutions programs, integrated warfare systems and sensors programs as well as command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C6ISR) programs.Operating profit improved a solid 143% year over year to $311 million and operating margin expanded 550 bps to 9.6%.Space Systems: Revenues at this segment dropped 3% year over year to about $2.3 billion in the first quarter. The decline can be primarily attributed to lower volumes for government satellite programs and commercial satellite programs.Operating profit was down 9% to $264 million, while operating margin contracted 70 bps to 11.3% in the quarter.Financial ConditionCash and cash equivalents were $2.39 billion as of Mar 25, 2018 compared with $2.86 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. Long-term debt was $13.47 billion compared with $13.51 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Cash from operations at the end of the first quarter was $0.6 billion compared with $1.7 billion at the end of year-ago quarter.In the quarter under review, Lockheed Martin repurchased 0.9 million shares for $300 million compared with the buyback of 1.9 million shares for $500 million a year ago. Also, the  company paid dividends worth $586 million to shareholders compared with the year-ago period figure of $544 million.GuidanceLockheed Martin has raised its 2018 financial guidance. The company expects to generate revenues in the range of $50.4-$51.9 billion compared with the prior guidance range of $50.0-$51.5 billion.On the bottom-line front, the company expects 2018 GAAP earnings per share to be in the band of $15.80-$16.10, up from the earlier guidance of $15.20-$15.50.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

1748,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract for providing ground and flight test support to post-deployment build (PDB)-8.1 Phased Array Tracking to Intercept Of Target (PATRIOT) Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2022.Valued at $46.7 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Red Stone Arsenal, Alabama. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds will be utilized to partially finance the task. Operations under the award will be carried out in Dallas, TX.A Brief Note on PAC-3 Missiles & PDBThe PAC-3 missile system is a long range, air defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system. It is developed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.Now, PDB 8.1 is a major software upgrade incorporated in PAC-3 system to improve communications and system capabilities of the missiles against threats. Notably, this upgrade offers significant enhancements to allow radar to support the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) range; address misclassification to prevent erroneous engagements and fratricides; improve ability to search, discriminate, and destroy tactical ballistic missiles as well as provide protection against electronic attacks.PAC-3’s Growth ProspectsLockheed Martin’s Missile and Fire Control (MFC) unit is one of the forerunners in the missile defense space. This division manufactures advanced combat, missile, rocket, manned and unmanned systems for the U.S. government and foreign allies. In relation to the aforementioned contract win, it is worth mentioning that PAC-3 is among the company’s top-notch missile systems.Coming to this missile systems’ performance in recent times, PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones in the first quarter of 2018. Evidently, Lockheed Martin won an award worth $500 million from the U.S. and international customers for upgradation of their missile defense capabilities using the company’s PAC-3 and PAC-3 missile segment enhancement (MSE), interceptors, lot kits, spares and support equipment.The company also signed major agreements with the U.S. and Polish officials, under which Poland became the fifth international PAC-3 MSE customer. Needless to say, such inflow of orders tends to fuel Lockheed Martin’s top-line growth. In first-quarter 2018, its MFC segment recorded net sales of $1.7 billion, reflecting a solid 8% improvement from the year-ago quarter.In the coming days, the demand for these combat-proven missiles is anticipated to increase, courtesy of the PAC-3 system’s software upgrades. Additionally, the MFC segment is expected to continue with its trend of delivering top-line growth in the second quarter of 2018.In February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for procuring 240 PAC-3 MSE. With widespread geo-political conflicts across the globe, such funding provisions is likely to keep Lockheed Martin on a growth trajectory.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 13.9% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 43.9%. This underperformance might have been due to intense competition in domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are AeroVironment (AVAV  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report). While AeroVironment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1749,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Gyrocam Systems business unit recently clinched a contract involving the production and delivery of spare parts for the AN/VSQ-6B Vehicle Optics Sensor system (VOSS). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 3, 2023.Valued at $80 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 through 2023 Army working capital funds and other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task, at Florida.Gyrocam Systems & VOSSLockheed Martin’s Gyrocam Systems offer gyro-stabilized electro-optical sensors and night vision enhancements that allow users to see through fog, haze and complete darkness. These sensors are cost-effective and can be easily tailored with interchangeable universal mounts for ground vehicles, airborne platforms, maritime vessels and perimeter security application. To date, more than 1,100 Gyrocam sensor systems have been installed in all branches of the U.S. military, law enforcement and NATO and coalition partners.The VOSS is a remotely-controlled, gyro-stabilized, telescoping, high-resolution, zoom capable multi-sensor (daylight camera, night vision camera, thermal imaging camera) surveillance system that uses existing commercial camera technology. This system has been use in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Major Army Commands on various variants of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle fleet.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and 2018 has not been any exception either. Recently, the company secured a contract worth $288 million for providing sensor systems along with other technical services for the Apache helicopter. Last week, it won a $175 million deal to support the F-35 Lightning depot implementation plan. Considering such frequent order inflows along with the latest one, we expect the company to reflect solid performance in the coming quarterly results, keeping its usual trend.Moreover, Lockheed Martin ended 2017 with backlog worth $99.9 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago number. This upside reflects increased demand from domestic and international customers. Additionally, its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs guarantees a steady flow of follow-on orders not only from the U.S. government but also from a large number of foreign allies of the nation.The recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget, which provisions for a spending of $716 billion in the United States’ defense, is also an added positive. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven program like the Gyrocam Systems, which in turn, should boost its profit margin.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Lockheed Martin’s stock has gained about 6% compared with the industry’s 28% rally. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

1750,LMT,"U.S. defense stocks once again paid the price for another indecisive move by President Trump with respect to his dealings with North Korea. On May 24, the White House called off the planned Jun 12 meeting in Singapore due to North Korea’s “tremendous anger and open hostility” targeted toward Washington.Interestingly, the stressed relationship between the United States and North Korea has long been a key catalyst for stocks in the U.S. aerospace and defense industry. No doubt, the initial cancellation of the summit, indicative at a possible improvement between the nations’ relationship, was cheered by defense stocks.However, according to a CNBC report on May 29, a tweet from Trump implied that the summit will take place in near future, although not most probably on Jun 12. This sudden resumption weighed on U.S. defense stocks. This is because an end to U.S.-North Korea tensions means less procurement of weaponries by the U.S. government, which in turn, will affect U.S. defense contractors’ profit.Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — dropped 2.2% in the trailing five trading sessions.Among the highlights from the last week, defense majors like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK  secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics business division recently secured a contract worth $558.3 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 11th lot. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by February 2023.While majority of the task will be performed in Orlando, FL, the rest will be executed in Redondo Beach, CA; Fort Worth, TX; Owego, NY and Samlesbury, United Kingdom (read more: Lockheed Martin Wins $558M Deal to Support F-35 Jets).The company also secured a modification contract for providing post production support to the Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by May 19, 2019.The contract includes domestic and foreign military sales to Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and South Korea.This $282-million deal was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama (read more: Lockheed Martin Clinches $282M Deal to Support PAC-3 Missile).2. Boeing clinched a modification contract worth $416.4 million for the full-rate production of three P-8A multi-mission maritime aircraft of the 9th lot. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by October 2020.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will manufacture and deliver the jets to the U.S. Navy.Majority of the work will be executed in Seattle, WA. Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds will be used to finance this task (read more: Boeing Wins $416M Navy Deal to Manufacture P-8A Aircraft).3. Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) business unit recently won a modification contract for providing Romania with Phased Array Tracking on Radar to Intercept Option (PATRIOT) Fire Unit. The deal came under the foreign military sales (FMS) program.Valued at $395.8 million, the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Work related to the deal will be performed in Andover, Tewksbury, Marlborough and Burlington, MA; Pelham, NH; McKinney, TX and Portsmouth, RI.The project is scheduled to be completed by Apr 30, 2020 (read more: Raytheon Wins $396M Deal to Modify Romania's PATRIOT System).4. Orbital ATK announced that it has received an order from NASA for two additional Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) spacecraft, which will be operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).Currently, the company is involved in the construction of the JPSS-2 spacecraft. Post the new order, it is likely to build three JPSS spacecrafts (JPSS-2, JPSS-3, and JPSS-4) for NASA that  are expected to provide critical weather forecasting data along with advance environmental and oceanographic science. Valued at about $460 million, the deal is expected to close by 2021, 2023 and 2026, respectively (read more: Orbital ATK Wins Order for 2 Additional JPSS Satellites).PerformanceOver the last five trading sessions, the defense biggies put up a mixed show. While Lockheed Martin gained the most with a 2.2% gain in its share price, General Dynamics lost the most with a 1.2% drop in the same.However, over the last six months, the entire industry has put up a stellar performance, except General Dynamics and Rockwell Collins. Keeping up with its usual trend, Boeing once again gained the most, with its shares surging 30.9%, followed by Raytheon.The following table shows the price movement of the major defense players over the past five trading days and during the last six months.CompanyLast WeekLast 6 MonthsLMT2.18%3.15%BA-0.69%30.89%GD-1.24%-0.62%RTN0.58%5.25%NOC0.67%1.28%COL-0.41%-0.58%TXT-0.95%0.97%LLL0.79%1.99% Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1751,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment has secured a modification contract to upgrade F-35 Lightning II aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2021.Valued at $20 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the deal, the company will deliver additional radar upgrades for the Block 3F software integrated in the F-35 jets.Notably, the project includes 58% of the work for the U.S. Air Force and 42% for Marine Corps. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Air Force and Marine Corps) will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully-fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first quarter of 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics have condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft coupled with its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets, in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 13.2% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 38.4%. The underperformance was most probably caused by the intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1753,LMT,"Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) was an integral part of the first “Space Race” and is poised to be a major player in the recently reinvigorated domestic space program, which includes plans to land humans on Mars by the 2030s.Lockheed’s RoleThe U.S. government contracted the aerospace and defense company to design and build the first Viking sounding rocket in 1949. Since then, Lockheed has worked extensively with NASA and helped propel numerous space explorations. And now, the company is ready to be a mainstay in the new 21st Century Space Race.""In terms of being the first to Mars, we have been on every Mars mission for it from the very first one,"" CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC. ""I think we will continue to be on every mission to Mars.""Hewson talked about two of Lockheed’s current space-related projects, including the Orion deep space capsule and the InSight spacecraft. Lockheed’s chief executive also seemed to welcome new private entrants into the world of space exploration. “It's great for attracting talent into the space programs that we're working on,” Hewson noted.Competition to MarsThe new “Race to Mars” has been driven, in large part, by Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) CEO Elon Musk and SpaceX. Musk has conducted a series of highly publicized rocket launches over the last year, and plans to try to colonize Mars as early as 2022.To many experts, Musk’s timetable seems a little too condensed, but it has undoubtedly forced companies like Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed to stay on their toes.Next stop Mars! But first, the @NASAInSight spacecraft heads to California for launch on an #AtlasV rocket. pic.twitter.com/M40iXBTvv1— Lockheed Martin (@LockheedMartin) March 1, 2018Lockheed’s Mars Base Camp is the company’s plan to send humans to Mars. But investors should note that this heavy investment in space isn’t projected to hurt Lockheed’s bottom line any time soon. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Lockheed’s earnings to surge 13.3% in the current quarter, despite spending on Mars-related projects.The company’s bottom line is also projected to climb by over 16.4% in its current fiscal year. On top of that, Lockheed is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 7.33% over the next three to five years.Lockheed noted that the Mars Base Camp concept is “built on a strong foundation of today’s technologies – making it safe, affordable and achievable.” Moreover, these plans could one day propel the company to new heights if this current Space Race lives up to the hype.Lockheed is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1754,LMT,"Drama continued at the White House on Tuesday after President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a sudden and unexpected move. Tillerson’s dismissal comes after a series of public and private disagreements with the President on several crucial policy matters, notably North Korea. A few other dismissals followed in its wake, signaling that the atmosphere surrounding the Oval Office continues to remain volatile.Trump also announced that he was replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Defense stocks rose following these developments as Pompeo is perceived to be more in line with Trump’s views on crucial policy issues. Tax cuts and a favorable budget deal have already provided significant impetus to the sector, which means this is a good time to add defense stocks to your portfolios.Trump, Tillerson Differed on Key Policy MattersThere have been long running differences between the former ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) CEO and Trump for some time now. Last year, Tillerson publicly distanced himself from Trump’s position on the white supremacist rally at Charlottesville by saying that “the President speaks for himself.”More significantly, Tillerson favored a more conciliatory and diplomatic tone on several key issues such as the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal while Trump favored a more belligerent approach. Tillerson also tried to prevent the President from exiting the Paris climate change agreement and had good relations with other Trump team members, most notably Secretary of Defense James Mattis.Ultimately, his advocacy of a diplomatic solution with North Korea brought things to a tipping point. When Tillerson first said that he wanted to begin a dialogue with North Korea, Trump publicly disagreed with him, tweeting that he was “wasting his time.” When the President finally changed his approach last week and agreed to meet Kim Jong-Un, he did not bother to inform or consult Tillerson on the issue.Pompeo in Sync with Trump, Muscular Approach LikelySeveral defense stocks increased early on Tuesday with Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) gaining 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively by the close. Most analysts feel that this is an outcome of Trump replacing Tillerson, who favored a more diplomatic approach, with Pompeo, who is more in line with the President’s thinking. And his opinion on several issues seems to confirm such a view.For instance, despite the continuing investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 President election, Pompeo has chosen to downplay the impact the Kremlin had on its results.  Like Trump, Pompeo is a firm critic of the Iran Nuclear deal and has called the agreement “disastrous.” While serving as congressman from Kansas, Pompeo opposed Obama’s decision to close down Guantanamo Bay.Pompeo seems to favor a hawkish approach in general and has expressed his support for the restoration of the NSA’s spying protocols. But the timing of his appointment ahead of discussions with North Korea means that Trump desires a team which maintains his hardline on North Korea. Pompeo is therefore likely to keep up the pressure against the Kim Jong Un regime.Our ChoicesTrump’s move to replace Tillerson with Matteo ahead of negotiations with North Korea shows that he intends to maintain his hard-nosed approach on key issues. A similar approach is likely to be witnessed against Iran, which can only result in the escalation of global tensions. Already buoyed by tax cuts and a favorable budget deal, such a scenario can only boost defense stocks further.This is why it makes good sense to pick select defense stocks at this point.

1756,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Missiles and Fire Control business unit recently won a $288.3 million modification contract for providing sensor systems along with other technical services for the Apache helicopter, to United Arab Emirates. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Arsenal, IL.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (M-TADS/PNVS), subcomponents and technical services for the Apache attack helicopter. The contract was secured under the domestic and foreign military sales program.Work related to the deal will be performed in Orlando, FL and is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2021. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 foreign military sales and aircraft procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on the M-TADS/PNVS SystemsThe Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (M-TADS/PNVS), also known as Arrowhead, is a long-range, precision engagement and pilotage solution for missions operated during the day, night and in adverse weather conditions. Lockheed Martin’s electro-optical sensor provides enhanced situational awareness to Apache’s aircrew, with greater performance and survivability.Advantages of the Apache Attack HelicopterThe AH-64 Apache Helicopter is the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopter,  which has been developed by Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and is used by the U.S. Army and a growing number of international defense forces.  AH-64E is the latest version of the AH-64 gunship and is equipped with new improved sensors, avionics and night operation capabilities. Further, it possesses an infra-red suppressing exhaust system as well as chaff and flare dispensers, which jointly reduce the chance of being located and hit by enemy air-defense missiles.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Steady and regular order inflows for Lockheed Martin’s MFC unit tend to fuel the company’s top-line growth. Notably, the company’s MFC segment recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1.7 billion, reflecting a healthy 8% improvement from the year-ago quarter. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost MFC’s revenue growth in the days to come.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. In particular, the budget includes a prospective increase in investment for the AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter, which has been allotted $1.3 billion. Lockheed Martin’s Apache fire control system provides the M-TADS/PNVS sensors along with other subcomponents for the Apache helicopter. These developments reflect substantial growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment, which, in turn, is likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.2% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically and internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Wesco Aircraft Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northrop Grumman delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 13.87% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 6.24% to $16.50 in the last 90 days.Wesco Aircraft Holdings’ long-term growth rate is pegged at 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 10% to 77 cents in the last 90 days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1757,LMT,"On Jun 22, the European Union (EU) slapped tariffs on $3.2 billion of American products in response to taxes imposed on steel and aluminum by the United States. It seems like trade tensions have rapidly spread to other parts of the world in a ripple effect of the ongoing dispute between America and China over tariff impositions and trade protectionism issues.Unfortunately, global stocks were caught in crossfire as is evident from their underperformance over the past five trading sessions. Consequently, a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon was not sufficient to boost the aerospace and defense stocks. Evidently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — dropped 0.6% in the last five trading sessions.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp.

1759,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.91%. Lockheed Martin has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 4.62%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Slew of Contract WinsBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from the Pentagon and its overseas clients, courtesy of its varied defense and military product offerings.Among the contracts Lockheed Martin won in the first quarter, the significant ones include $3.5 billion deal to offer army training solutions to the U.S Army and $1.5 billion contract for the procurement of spare parts for F-35 lightning II air systems.Other notable contracts also include a $524 million modification contract for the delivery of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles, a $522 million deal for the production of Trident II (D5) missile and a contract worth $481.2 million to support the construction of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships.Evidently, such steady flow of orders will certainly boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter sales is pegged at $11.3 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.22%.Other Factors at PlayIn 2017, the company completed the last F-16 production aircraft delivery. So the absence of this product line might weigh on Lockheed’s Aeronautics segment’s revenues in the first quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $4.2 billion for this unit shows a 6% annual decline.Management at Lockheed Martin expects to deliver higher earnings in 2018, buoyed by lower tax rate, higher segment operating profit and improved FAS/CAS outlook. We believe such year-over-year bottom-line improvement will get reflected in the company’s first-quarter results as well. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.40 per share, reflecting a 13.3% increase year over year.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of -1.09%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the probability of earnings beat. But when combined with a negative earnings ESP, the Zacks Rank #3 makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the Aerospace-Defense sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 25.

1760,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) segment, Space Systems, recently secured a $928-million modification contract for the development of hypersonic conventional strike weapon. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.Details of the DealPer the terms, Lockheed Martin will offer the design, engineering, systems integration, test, logistics planning, and aircraft integration support of all the elements of a hypersonic, conventional, air-launched, stand-off weapon.Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Huntsville; AL. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on Hypersonic WeaponA hypersonic weapon, considered as high-speed maneuvering weapon, is a missile that travels five times faster than the speed of sound. Its extraordinary speed and precision help a hypersonic weapon to hit any target, anywhere in the world, in less than an hour.According to CNBC, currently two types of hypersonic weapons are in development: hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. While, hypersonic cruise missiles can fly at altitudes up to 100,000 feet, hypersonic glide vehicles can fly above 100,000 feet.Our ViewReportedly, the United States, Russia and China are the forerunners in developing hypersonic weapons. However, both Russia and China have moved ahead of the United States in hypersonic weapon technologies innovation. As a result, in case such a weapon is deployed on the U.S. soils, the nation doesn’t have sufficient defense to protect itself. In fact, Air Force Gen. John Hyten, himself has expressed doubt regarding the U.S.’s ability to defend itself against such weapon. This in turn might constrain the U.S. military’s global presence and impede its ability to project force in key regions.Consequently, the U.S. government is pursuing development of a range of hypersonic weapons to ensure superiority over China and Russia’s growing hypersonic arsenal. This is evident from the fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions an increase in the research and development funds by $18 billion, which includes upgrading the country’s hypersonic technology. Such investments on hypersonic weapons along with the latest contract win will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s top line in the days ahead.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 30.2% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 50.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report),  Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report). While Curtiss-Wright sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Huntington Ingalls and Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Curtiss-Wright recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 15.06% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 52 cents to $5.79 in the last 90 days.Huntington Ingalls recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by $4.94 to $17.38 in the last 90 days.Boeing posted an average positive earnings surprise of 20.69% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by $2.01 to $14.05 in the last 90 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1761,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $200-million modification contract for enhancing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile segment. Per the terms, Lockheed Martin will also help to develop Patriot's Launch on Remote (LOR). The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie, TX. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to partially fund the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2022.A Brief Note on THAAD and PATRIOTThe THAAD is an anti-missile system that uses a hit-to-kill approach to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. It has a 100% mission success in flight testing since 2005.Whereas, PAC-3 missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system, designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Being the Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin regularly wins contracts for its varied missile segments that include both THAAD and PAC-3 missiles. In February, the company won a $524-million contract for the production of PAC-3 enhancement missiles and toward the end of January 2018, it clinched $459-million deal for the production and delivery of interceptors for the THAAD weapon system.Such inflow of orders for its varied missiles boosts Lockheed Martin’s top line. Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment recorded net sales of $2.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, reflecting a solid 31% improvement from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, is expected to gain significantly from this provision, which includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 82 THAAD missiles and $1.7 billion for the procurement of 43 AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense systems. We believe these developments, along with the latest contract wins, will enable Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment to deliver similar solid performance in first quarter as well.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 29.9% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 49.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).

1762,LMT,"The United States along with its French and UK allies launched a series of airstrikes on Syria over the last weekend. 105 missiles were fired on three facilities involved in research or storage of chemical weapons in western Syria. On Apr 7, Duma was a witness to a chemical attack which claimed several lives. The recent attack is believed to be a response to the same. The world once again witnessed fresh tension following which U.S. defense stocks gained substantially as majority of the weapons used in the strike were provided by them.Russia’s StanceRussia strongly condemned the latest U.S.-led airstrikes and repudiated America’s claim that Russian president Vladimir Putin supported Syrian leader Assad in the chemical attack. Russia’s ambassador to the United States warned that the country will handle the issue with firm hands and the defamation of the Russian president will be dealt with.Criticizing the latest attack as an ""act of aggression"", Putin warned that further strikes from Western countries on Syria will have implications on global affairs.Will Russia Strike Back?Though Russia strongly condemned the Syrian attack, majority of experts believe that Russia will not engage in any direct conflict with the United States, at least in the near term.  Per a report by CNBC one analyst said ""likelihood of a direct, military response to the strikes from Russia is very low.""Despite the Russian ambassador’s repeated threats of the nation targeting and destroying the platforms from which the missiles were fired, Moscow is fully aware that such attacks will bring Russia in a direct face-to-face conflict with the United States. Thus a Russian retaliation is unlikely in the near term.Economic Sanctions to Play a Role?Recently rounds were made that the United States intends to levy new economic sanctions on Russia for its apparent support of the Syrian leader Assad.  In particular, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced on Apr 15 that the United States will put new economic sanctions on companies ""dealing with equipment"" used in Assad’s alleged chemical attack.However, President Trump, in a recent meet, dismissed possibilities of imposing new sanctions on Russia in the near term. Should the move come, it will further strain the relationship between these two nations. Notably, relations between the United States and Russia have failed to remain genial after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on several Russian tycoons close to Putin, earlier this month, due to their involvement in the 2016 election.In the near future, it is expected that by imposing stringent economic sanctions Trump will try to keep Russia under pressure and also ensure that the nation abstains from involving in its Syrian affairs.Defense Stocks to Gain From the Conflict: Here’s Why Historical data shows that shares of U.S. defense majors have spiked whenever the United States has engaged in military activities. Of the 105 missiles fired at Syria, 19 were JASSMs manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and 66 were Tomahawk cruise missiles made by Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). Evidently, their shares gained more than 0.5% in the past couple of trading sessions. Stocks to Place Bet OnIf Russia ultimately decides to retaliate, the fresh conflict will provide a solid boost to U.S. defense stocks. Therefore, adding defense stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and strong financials to your portfolio will be a prudent move.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries, and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors. Apart from manufacturing top-rated commercial and military aircraft, it also offers strategic missile and defense systems as well as command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR).The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.69% in the trailing four quarters.

1763,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business unit recently won an $86.8 million five-year contact to support the Iraqi Air Force’s fleet of C-130J aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide support services to the Iraqi Air Force that includes contractor logistics support, technical assistance, aircraft and aerospace ground equipment, spares, repairs, and familiarization training on their existing six C-130J aircraft.Work related to the deal will be performed at Martyr Mohammed Ala Air Base, Iraq and is expected to get completed by Jun 30, 2022. Lockheed Martin will utilize foreign military sales funds for completing the tasks. The deal comes with a ceiling value of $100 million.Benefits of the C-130J Hercules AircraftThe C–130J Hercules is a medium-sized tactical transport airlift aircraft that is capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. These include the deployment and redeployment of troops, supplies within command areas in a theater of operation, aero-medical evacuation, air logistics support and augmentation of strategic airlift forces. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the Air Force combat delivery mission compared to the legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short) aircraft.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division remains focused on upgrading and providing enhanced support services for its legacy C-130 Hercules fleet, worldwide. In 2017, Lockheed Martin delivered 26 C-130J aircraft, of which seven were international deliveries. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had 64 of these tactical aircraft in its backlog, a number we believe will increase in the coming days, courtesy of the latest contract clinched by the company.The Aeronautics division successfully delivered the 400th C-130J Super Hercules aircraft in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the overall performance of the C-130J program has been continuing to draw global demand with operators in 18 countries. Inevitably, we can expect the Aeronautics division to secure more similar contracts involving its C-130J jets in the days ahead.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget includes a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s C-130J transport aircraft program that has been allotted $1.57 billion.Moreover, the 2018 Appropriations Act supported increased funding for 17 additional C-130J aircraft. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s C-130J program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 5.3% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 27.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Textron and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1764,LMT,"In a not so surprising move on May 8, the United States withdrew from the historic deal designed to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Further, a spate of other sanctions is likely to be slapped on the Middle Eastern country. President Trump has characterized the Iran nuclear agreement as a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.”However, since the deal was suspended, defense stocks have rallied, primarily due to international geopolitical tensions that such developments give rise to. Investors can make the most of this opportunity to bet on the top defense stocks for alluring returns.Geopolitical Tensions Post Trump’s AnnouncementQuite expectedly, the sanctions and a complete annulment of the deal hasn’t gone down too well with Iran. The country has openly criticized such a decision by Trump, with its president Hassan Rouhani stating that Iran choses to stay in the deal even without the United States.Adding to the already tense environment, state-governed media from Syria reported on the afternoon of May 8 that Israel had fired missiles on sites near Damascus that are linked to Iran. Further, Saudi Arabia stated on May 9 that its air force had neutralized two more ballistic missiles over its city Riyadh, apparently fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen.Analysts fear that if the nuclear deal is not kept alive till the end of this year and if U.S. reimposes sanctions that were already in effect before the deal, the situation may worsen. Going by the trend, Trump is unlikely to budge from his decision and the nuclear deal might not make it through the next year. Such circumstances are likely to aggravate tensions to quite an extent.Defense Stocks on a TearDefense heavyweights such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (RTN), Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) have rallied since Trump’s annulment of the deal. Between May 8 and May 11, shares of these giants have gained 1.4%, 2.6%, 1%, 1.7% and 2.4%, respectively, on the back of geopolitical uncertainties associated with such developments.Defense contractors with significant exposure to the Middle East are poised to gain immensely from international tensions that are flaring up. Such companies will capitalize on increased orders for missile defense and tactical missile systems along with increased demand for ships and other aircraft equipment.4 Hot ChoicesWith escalating international tensions and the unlikelihood of a reversal in Trump’s decision, it's not difficult to imagine why defense stocks might get a shot in the arm. In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.L3 Technologies, Inc.

1765,LMT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently clinched a modification contract for procuring long lead parts associated with the manufacture of 19 P-8A aircraft of the 10th Lot. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by March 2022.Details of the DealValued at $282.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the deal, 10 of the 19 jets will be delivered to the U.S. Navy, five to the government of Norway and four to the U.K. administration.Majority of the work will be executed in Seattle, WA and the rest at Cambridge, U.K. and various other locations across the United States. Notably, the deal includes 49.7% of the work for the U.S. Navy, 28.7% for the government of Norway and 21.6% for the U.K.Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds will be utilized to complete the task.About P-8A AircraftBoeing’s P-8A Multi-mission Maritime aircraft, also known as Poseidon, is used for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and intelligence as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is also capable of broad-area littoral operations.A derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, the P-8A and its variant for India, the P-8I, delivers superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability in the future battle space.Our ViewBeing one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s defense segment stands out among peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Of late, it has also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon.During 2017, the defense segment had backlog worth $50 billion, further reflecting the slew of orders that Boeing enjoys for its varied weaponries. Going ahead, similar backlog figures can be expected at this segment, buoyed by contract wins like the latest one.Considering the fiscal 2019 defense budget worth $716 billion, proposed by President Trump last month, we expect Boeing to win more contracts from the Pentagon on solid demand for its military aircraft.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing's shares have surged about 93.8% compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%.

1766,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a foreign military sales (“FMS”) contract worth $481.2 million to support the construction of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (“MMSC”) ships. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by October 2024.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Walpole, MA; Washington, D.C., Moorestown, NJ, Germany and a few other locations. The agreement will cater to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.A Brief Note on MMSC Lockheed Martin’s MMSC is a derivative of the US Navy’s Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship (“LCS”). It is a lethal and highly-maneuverable surface combatant that performs littoral and open-ocean operations.With proven combat management system lineage, Lockheed Martin’s MMSC has the interoperability necessary for today’s joint and allied naval force maneuvers. Paired with world’s most advanced maritime helicopter, MH-60R SEAHAWK, the MMSC has a robust anti-submarine mission capability that is fully interoperable with the U.S. Navy and its coalition partners.Our ViewApart from being Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin is also the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s latest LCS. With President Trump in favor of spending heavily in the nation’s defense arena, his reign is considered to be a golden era for aerospace-defense players like Lockheed Martin.This gets very well reflected in the fiscal 2019 (FY2019) defense budget that was released last month. For the Naval section, the FY 2019 budget provisions for procurement of one LCS for $1.3 billion. This in turn will boost Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment that designs, manufactures, serves and supports a variety of defense products like the LCS.During fourth-quarter 2017, RMS segment registered 14% top-line growth. We may expect this business unit to show similar upward sales trend in the first quarter and beyond, buoyed by the latest contract that the company won along with the recent budgetary amendments.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock moved up about 27.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. This underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report).

1767,LMT,"Trump’s announcement that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports has become the latest cause of concern for the U.S. economy and Wall Street. The tariffs are likely to result in an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers that use these metals.Against this backdrop, with the help of an article published on npr.org, we highlight some sectors that could be impacted the most from the tariffs (read: Watch These ETFs as Trade War Risks Rise).AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. The American Automotive Policy Council believes that the change would put the U.S. auto industry at a ""competitive disadvantage.""However, the price hike won’t be the same for all. CNBC reported that General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) sees only a modest impact because it buys 90% of “steel for U.S. production from U.S. suppliers."" On the other hand, Honda Motor Co (HMC  -  Free Report) said that “imprudent tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum would raise prices on both domestic and imported products, thus causing an unnecessary financial burden on customers.”In this situation, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund CARZ should be monitored closely. However, since the fund invests only 19.67% in the United States, severe threat to the product is unexpected (read: ETFs in Focus Post Automobile Earnings).Alternative EnergySolar projects, wind turbines and energy storage units are also likely to be pricier. The tariff could result in a hike in the cost of offshore platforms and pipelines. In any case, the Trump administration's 30% tariff on imported solar cells and modules was put into effect this year (read: Trump's Import Tariffs: ETF & Stocks in Focus).Now with extra price increases on steel and aluminum, “which are used in ground-mount and rooftop solar racking systems,” the sector could be hit hard. Alternative ETFs including Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report) and First Trust ISE Global Wind Energy Index Fund (FAN  -  Free Report) should thus be followed with extra caution (read: Alternative Energy ETFs to Gain From First Solar Q4 Results).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) may come under pressure. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to high costs for Hershey Company HSY and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ. ""Such a broad and sweeping order could have a negative impact on the entire U.S. economy, potentially costing U.S. jobs and ultimately, hurting American consumers through higher prices for everyday products,"" according to the Hershey spokesman, as quoted on npr.org.BeerLast but not the least, how can investors forget the beer industry? Imported aluminum is used to make beer cans. Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA (BUD  -  Free Report), Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report) and Diageo Plc (DEO  -  Free Report) may face the rising cost issue. At the same time, the announcement puts Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF WSKY in focus.ConsumerAlong with most market watchers, we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers. As a result, consumer ETFs like iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF IYC may get slightly hurt.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1768,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a delivery contract in relation to F-35 fighter jet. Work related to this deal is expected to be completed by February 2019.Details of the DealValued at $158.3 million, the deal was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will offer program management, nonrecurring engineering, recurring engineering, site support and touch labor services to aid the modification and retrofit activities of the delivered air systems of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract will cater to the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participant, and foreign military sales (“FMS”) customers.  The deal includes 48% of the work for the Air Force; 31% for the Marine Corps, 6% for the Navy, 11% for the non-DoD participants and 4% for international partners.Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement, fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement, fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement, non-DoD participant and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provides F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales, as well as 64% of Aeronautics division’s net sales in 2017. Interestingly, this program has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project, in the recent past.To resolve this issue, the company inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate owing to Trump's intervention or to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%. Over the next few years, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the latest contract win will enable the company to take a step toward in achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35, while in August 2017 it won a contract worth $427million for procuring ancillary military equipment and pilot flight equipment for LRIP of the 11th Lot of F-35 jets.Production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456  aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. Therefore, Lockheed Martin has solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn will surely boost its profit margin.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1769,LMT,"Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) climbed over 1% on Tuesday to hit a new all-time intraday high after the White House confirmed a deal with the aerospace giant for two new Air Force One planes.Air Force One dealBoeing reached an initial deal with the Trump administration to buy two new highly-modified 747s. The cost will reportedly be capped at $3.9 billion. This deal comes after Trump criticized the cost of, and threatened to cancel, a previously-discussed $4 billion deal for new Air Force One aircrafts before he took office in December 2016.Trump later met with chief executives from Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) to discuss the cost of some defense contracts.“President Trump has reached an informal deal with Boeing on a fixed price contract for the new Air Force One Program,” a White House spokesman said in a statement. “Thanks to the President's negotiations, the contract will save the taxpayers more than $1.4 Billion.”It seems that the cost savings are being measured against an updated $5 billion estimate. Work on the new Air Force One planes is expected to start in 2019, with the aircrafts projected to begin service in fall 2023. However, the initial timetable is subject to change according to the Wall Street Journal.Boeing is proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American Presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers. President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people. pic.twitter.com/m0HtGfXVlv— The Boeing Company (@Boeing) February 27, 2018Other Contracts Boeing has already been awarded four other contracts in February alone, according to U.S. Department of Defense releases. The company secured a $219.6 million contract with the Navy as well as a larger joint deal worth $268.7 million. Boeing also landed three contracts with the U.S. Air Force this month worth a combined total of roughly $280 million.On top of that, Hawaiian Holdings (HA) also reportedly recently made a deal to purchase a small amount of Boeing 787-9 aircraft, according to Scott Hamilton of Leeham News and Comment.More Fundamentals Investors should also note that aside from bolstering its contracts, Boeing is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. The firm also currently boasts an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system.Boeing is projected to see its first-quarter 2018 earnings soar by over 32%, while its EPS figure is expected to climb 34% the following quarter, based on current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Both are comparatively-large quarterly gains for a company of Boeing’s size and age.Furthermore, Boeing has failed to top or match earnings estimates just once over the last five years. This includes an average earnings surprise of over 20% in the trailing four quarters, culminating with a 65% beat in Q4.Investors might also be happy to know that Boeing has earned 10 earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal year, with 100% agreement to the upside.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1770,LMT,"Though the prospect of higher-than-expected rates hike and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal of dividend stocks, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are six of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.

1771,LMT,"On Friday night, President Trump revealed that he had authorized U.S. armed forces to conduct precision military strikes on Syria. The attacks, conducted in unison with France and Britain, was a reprisal for the chemical attack ordered by the Assad regime on the rebel-held town of Duma on Apr 7. On Apr 14, Trump declared that the strikes were a success, tweeting “Mission Accomplished.”Meanwhile, Russia expressed anger over the U.S.-led missile strike on Syria. And on Sunday, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said the United States is likely to impose new sanctions against Russia because it continues to back President Assad’s regime. With recent missile strikes likely to snowball into an extended conflict, it makes sense to stock up on defense stocks.    “Mission Accomplished,” Says TrumpTrump’s order for a missile strike on Syria was a marked departure from his initial stance on the issue. As late as last week, Trump had said that he was in favor of U.S. forces withdrawing from Syria. But the situation changed drastically after Apr 7 with the President tweeting that missile strikes were likely forthcoming.On Apr 14, Trump said the missile strikes were “perfectly executed” and had accomplished their objective. Defense Secretary James Mattis also characterized the strikes as a “one time shot.” But Trump also said the United States was “prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.""Russia Warns of “Consequences”, U.S. Sanctions LikelyRussia has expressed its displeasure over the U.S. led joint strike with its ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov saying that his country’s “worst apprehensions have come true. Antonov’s statement, released on Twitter also warned that unspecified “consequences” were likely to follow.Comments from U.S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Sunday raised chances of an escalation even further. Speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Haley said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Monday. These sanctions would be targeted at “companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use.”Defense Stocks Benefit From Middle-East ConflictTogether, the United States, Russia and France launched 105 missiles on targets in Syria. Of these, 19 were JASSMs manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and 66 were Tomahawk cruise missiles made by Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). On Wednesday, shares of both these companies gained almost 1% after Trump said Russia should “get ready” for a missile attack on Syria.Meanwhile, historical data shows that U.S. defense stocks tend to outperform the broader market when the United States engages in a military offensive in the Middle-East. CNBC Analysis using Kensho shows that the S&P 500 aerospace sub-industry gained 1.5% a month after such an offensive. Over the same period, the Dow and the S&P 500 gained less than 1%. On Apr 11, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) gained 0.5% even as the S&P 500 lost 0.3%.Our ChoicesThough the Pentagon believes that the current offensive has been concluded, signs are rife that it may have only served to escalate tensions. Russia has issued strong protests against the assault and with the United States preparing to issue fresh economic sanctions, the conflict in Syria is far from over.Also, historical data shows that U.S. defense stocks gain after a military offensive in the Middle East. Adding select defense stocks to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

1772,LMT,"A deadlock to pass the budget deal in the U.S. Senate led to a federal shutdown at midnight on Feb 8 with Senator Rand Paul repeatedly stalling proceedings. This brought into the fore partisan division and continued bickering within both the parties, closing non-essential government operations for the second time in less than a month.  As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 26 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

1773,LMT,"The Q4 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with more than 75% of S&P 500’s total market capitalization having released their quarterly results. As of Feb 7, of the 294 index members that have reported results, 79.6% beat on earnings, while 76.9% surpassed revenue estimates.Coming to the broader Aerospace sector, 81.8% of the defense stocks have an earnings beat ratio of 77.8% on sales beat of 55.6%, as of Feb 7.Given the impressive Q4 performance of the defense stocks, the sector’s recent performance should have been a robust one.  However, a spike in bond yields last week and chances of increased inflation along with a plunge in oil prices dealt a huge blow to Wall Street.

1774,LMT,"In this week’s video, I discuss General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report).  Both of these companies recently reported earnings, and gave long term data to support their future growth.  General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) reported earnings where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  2017 was a great year for the company as they set several quarterly and annual records.  For FY 17, the company posted records in EPS diluted-adjusted of $6.62, EBIT-adjusted margins +8.8%, North America EBIT-adjusted margins +10.7%, and GM Financial EBT-adjusted of $1.2 billion.  As for the quarterly records, EBIT-adjusted of $3.1 billion up +18.7%, ESP diluted-adjusted of $1.65 a +21.3% increase, North America EBIT-adjusted of $2.9 billion, and GM Financial EBT-adjusted of $0.3 billion with revenues up $3.3 billion.  The big driver behind the record breaking year was international sales.  For the year, the company sold 8.9 vehicles globally, which was a +0.8% improvement from the previous year.  Further, GM saw all three key markets increase their market share.  But, the biggest area of sales growth was in China, as the company sold 4 million vehicles which was a record. Moreover, the Cadillac brand saw a sales increase of +51%.  In South America, the Chevy brand saw sales increase by +13.8%.  Lastly, global deliveries of electric vehicles hit a record of 69,500 with the Chevrolet Bolt EV seeing deliveries of 26,000, another record high.  Looking into 2018, the company is introducing new full-sized trucks; the GMC Sierra, and Chevrolet Silverado.  The addition of these two new vehicles gives GM the “widest-ranging” truck portfolio in the industry.  The automaker is also introducing four new crossover vehicles; Chevrolet Travers, Buick Enclave, GMC Terrain, and the new Cadillac XT4 crossover.  This innovation and introduction of new models in the pickup and crossover segments is very important, as consumer preferences have shifted from the typical passenger car, to these areas.  Further, GM can produce these pickups and crossovers at a reduced cost, and sell them for higher prices.  Beyond 2018, the company is still on track to introduce at least 20 (potentially 23) new all-electric vehicles by 2023.  This is key in both the Chinese and India markets as the countries are trying to curb vehicle emissions.  In the earnings report, management announced that it expects the 2018 performance to be in line with its record breaking 2017 results.  Further, management stated that 2019 results will be propelled by its new line of pickup trucks.  So, after filing for bankruptcy in 2009, the company has bounced back, and looks to be well positioned for years to come.  Oh by the way, the company also pays a solid 3.59% annual dividend as well.  Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) also posted earnings results where they crushed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  The company had an excellent quarter where they saw year over year gains in several important categories; Net sales +9.4%, Adjusted earnings +25.1%, and Cash from operations +105.8%.  Further, LMT’s four main segments, Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems, and Space, all saw improvements in net sales, and operating profit.  One of the big areas for the company is the building and maintenance of the new F-35 fighter jets for the U.S. military.  In 2016, LMT delivered 53 new jets, and another 66 in 2017.  This pace is expected to ramp up all the way through 2022 with an estimated 168 new jets delivered for a total of 745 by the end of the current contract.  This will provide a steady stream of income for the company for the next four years. Further, in just the last 8 days, Lockheed Martin was awarded just under $800 million in new contracts that extend through 2021.Another positive for LMT is the new budget proposal, which has been reported to have a tentative agreement in Congress that calls for a significant increase in defense spending.  LMT would be a direct beneficiary of this increased spending.  Due to the positive outlook, management increased FY 2018 EPS guidance on the upside, and guided in line for FY 18 revenues.  Lastly, the company also pays a nice 2.32% annual dividend, so while the company continues to grow, the investor will get the added bonus of an above average dividend too.

1775,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $524-million modification contract for Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles, under the domestic and foreign military sales program. Per the deal, the company will delivery PAC-3 enhancement missiles, reduction initiative missiles and associate ground support equipment to the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Romania.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL and Huntsville, AL.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Jan 31, 2021.A Brief Note on PAC-3 MissilesThe PAC-3 missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.Per Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor has a two-pulse solid rocket motor that boosts altitude and range. The company anticipates that demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.Recent DevelopmentsLockheed Martin’s PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company was successful in neutralizing four tactical ballistic missile targets that eventually led to the initiation of full-rate production for PAC-3 MSE interceptors.Moreover, Lockheed Martin signed major agreements with the U.S. and Romanian officials. The company won PAC-3 MSE missile orders from the Romanian Army to upgrade its air defense system. Lockheed Martin also received orders worth $900 million for PAC-3 missile production for the United States and allied military forces.Needless to say, such inflow of orders will fuel the top line of Lockheed Martin. Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control segment, which produces the PAC-3 defense missiles and interceptors, recorded fourth-quarter 2017 net sales of $2.3 billion, reflecting a solid 31% improvement from the year-ago quarter.In December 2017, the U.S. government passed a Continuing Resolution Bill which included an additional $4.7 billion over the prior bill for emergency defense funding. Out of the $4.7 billion, nearly $4 billion was allocated for missile defense needs which also included request for Lockheed Martin’s 50 additional THAAD interceptors and nearly 150 PAC-3 MSE missiles. With widespread geo-political uncertainty still looming across the globe, such funding provisions is likely to keep the company on a growth trajectory.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 34.5% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 46.4% growth. The underperformance was caused by intense competition in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks    Lockheed Martin sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems Holdings (SPR  -  Free Report), each of them flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

1776,LMT,"On May 3, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. factory orders for the month of March grew at 1.6%. The increase in March marked the seventh rise in the past eight months. This indicates that the U.S. manufacturing sector, which constitutes around 12% of its GDP, is increasing capital spending on the back of massive tax overhaul, deregulatory measures and strong domestic & global economy.The worldwide demand for manufacturing products is on the rise. U.S. manufacturing industry is benefiting from strong global growth, which is leading to a sharp rise in factory orders. Against this backdrop, it will be prudent to invest in stocks that are poised to gain from the solid factory orders data.Robust Factory Orders in Marchfactory orders in March rose by 1.6% ($7.8 billion) to $507.7 billion. This figure was better than the consensus estimate of growth of 1.3%, on par with the revised growth rate of 1.6% in February.  New orders for manufactured goods increased $6.5 billion or 2.6% to $255.2 billion in March. This reflects the fourth increase in last five months.Shipments of manufactured goods inched up 0.4% ($900 million) to $250.4 billion. This marked the tenth month of increase in the last eleven months. Transportation equipment rose 1.8% to $83.5 billion, driving overall growth. This was the fourth increase of transportation equipment in last five months.Meanwhile, the ISM Manufacturing Index came in at 59.3%. Although the index slipped 1.5%, the signs are positive, as 17 of the 18 manufacturing industries registered growth. The March PMI figure also marks overall economic growth for the 107th consecutive month. (Read More: 5 Solid Stocks to Buy on Robust Durable Orders)Immediate Concerns The U.S. manufacturing sector is currently plagued with three concerns. The tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum has raised input costs. President Trump has levied tariffs worth $50 billion on China and is reportedly trying hard to impose another $100 billion of tariffs on the country. These massive tariffs on imported goods will raise input prices for manufactured products.On April 30, the Department of Commerce reported that personal consumption expenditure (“PCE”) price index increased year-over-year to 2% in March, touching the central bank’s target for the first time in a year. This may force the central banks to raise interest rate consequently increasing the cost of funds.Future Looks Bright Despite Concerns   However, newly introduced tax-reforms and deregulation policies are likely to act as major catalysts.  The corporate tax rate was lowered from 35% to 21%. President Trump has also promised to remove 75% of the regulations during his tenure. Trump’s business-friendly policies ought to help the private employers. Nevertheless, the full effect of corporate tax cut is yet to appear in the economy.Moreover, the government has taken a decision to spend a whopping $1.5 trillion on several infrastructure projects like constructing new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across the country over a period of 10 years. This project will generate significant demand for manufacturing sector.Our Top Picks Many economists believe that investment growth is likely to pick up in the near term. Strong factory orders aided by steady demand for transportation equipment such as civil aircraft and defense-capital goods hint a bullish economic outlook. At this stage, investment in stocks likely to gain from strong factory orders is a lucrative option.We narrowed down our search to five stocks with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and strong growth potential.

1778,LMT,"The aerospace and defense sector has been on a rally since last year. This has primarily been due to President Donald Trump’s push to boost defense spending in the United States. Further, a steep reduction in corporate taxes late last year will prove to be instrumental in bolstering growth for the sector in 2018.Also, Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget plan beefs up spending on defense and military research by as much as $470 billion over the next two years. Under such circumstances, the space is poised to breach boundaries in 2018 as the momentum that the segment picked up in last one year will continue.Defense Rally to Continue The space has seen splendid growth over the last one year. This is evident from the rise that the three broader ETFs tracking the sector has experienced in a year. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA have all surged 34.9%, 31.3% and 31.9%, respectively. Notably, all these ETFs have surpassed the S&P 500’s (.INX) performance in the same period where the broader index climbed 17.4%.Coming to the top players in the industry, we find a similar trend of growth with each of the stocks individually surpassing the S&P 500’s performance in a year’s time. Shares of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) have gained 43.2%, 45%, 43.6%, 19.6%, 34.9%, 46% and 20.4%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump’s Defense Budget ProposalThere’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has come as a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled its fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by the President, in a bid to rebuild the U.S. military into a more agile and lethal force globally. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Of the total, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level, and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity.More Mergers & Acquisitions in PipelineIn the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies has agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion.While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Trump’s zeal to fortify the U.S. military has only strengthened the defense sector’s fortunes. The space rallied throughout last year, breaking boundaries in the second half of 2017 in particular. Most importantly, a reduction in corporate taxes to 21% has opened up more avenues for investments. Such developments have paved way for a plethora of acquisitions in the defense and aerospace segment in 2018.On Feb 12, the day Trump presented his second annual federal budget proposal, General Dynamics announced plans to purchase CSRA Inc  in a bid to venture and gradually expand the government sector business.Commenting on the deal, General Dynamics’ executive vice president of Information Systems & Technology Daniel Johnson stated that the company has an expanding budget and the analysts within the company believe that the services sector would spring back to pre-2011 conditions when the space was in its prime. This has encouraged the company to invest more on such ventures.Moreover, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.U.S. Leads Global Defense ExportsEmerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.According to the latest report from Aerospace Industries Association, United States led the global exports in the aerospace and defense segment in 2017. The country accounted for 34% of the total industry export. Further, U.S. Department of Commerce, the defense segment generated an astounding $143 billion from exports alone.Also, per the report from Aerospace Industries Association, China maintained the top spot as the largest importer of defense products from the U.S., accounting for a total of $16.3 billion worth of goods. Further, France and United Kingdom came in as the second and third, purchasing goods worth $12.9 billion and $10 billion, respectively.To ConcludeThe U.S. defense sector started off 2018 on solid note and is poised to witness stupendous growth in the days to come with a massive defense budget, steep reduction in corporate taxes and a plethora of merger deals and acquisitions lined up for 2018. Its recognition as the largest exporter of defense products in the world is another feather in its cap.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1779,LMT,"With Jay Powell now at the helm of the Federal Reserve instead of Janet Yellen, focus has shifted to how interest rates are likely to change in the imminent future given a healthy economic scenario buoyed by reduced taxes and increased federal spending. As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for Screening In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.61%.Usually contract wins from the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States drive revenues for defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Unfortunately, the company did not secure any notable contract during the first quarter of 2018. This is likely to weigh on the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter.L3 Technologies’ strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividends, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Continuing with its trend of consistent dividend hike, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 6.7% in February 2018 to 80 cents. The company’s balance sheet is expected to display solid figures during the earnings call.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Impressively, L3 Technologies constitutes that combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.33%.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 0.92%.Transdigm has been riding on prudent acquisitions, positive industry trends, solid operational execution and steadily growing end markets. The company projects operating profit and bottom-line growth to benefit from the same in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Transdigm has been witnessing negative trends in some end markets, of late, like weaker defense after-market orders as well as soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to dent its top-line growth.Of late, the company’s Defense business’ performance has been better than expectations, adding to its strength. Moreover, a diversified revenue base lowers the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and will continue to play a significant role in maintaining financial performance in the near future.The Earnings ESP for Transdigm is -1.34%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Therefore, our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this quarter. Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated Quote What’s Ahead?Stay tuned!

1786,LMT,"According to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, U.S. durable goods order rose 2.6% in March. The rise can be attributed to an increase of 44.5% in orders for commercial aircraft. Moreover, orders for defense capital-goods jumped, giving a clear indication that the U.S. manufacturing industry is on steady track.Earlier this month, the Commerce Department said that factory orders rose 1.2%, primarily on orders for transportation equipment aided by robust orders for civilian airlines. Moreover, the U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI registered 59.3% growth. U.S. manufacturing industry is benefiting from strong global growth, which is leading to a sharp rise in durable goods’ orders.The rise in orders of commercial aircraft and defense capital goods bears testimony to the underlying strength in the country’s economy. Against this backdrop, it makes good sense to invest in stocks that are poised to gain from the solid durable goods orders data.Higher Durable Goods Order to Boost ConfidenceOrders for durable goods rose 2.6% in March, higher than the estimated increase of 1.6%. The rise was mainly backed by strong demand for commercial aircraft, which surged 44.5% to almost $21 billion. This follows a 39.1% rise in February after a 27.9% drop in January. Apart from commercial aircraft, the rise in durable goods orders was driven by a 0.9% increase in orders for defense capital-goods.The overall demand for transportation increased 7.6% to $91.4 billion in March, making it clear that airlines and defense capital-goods are driving durable goods’ orders. Also, orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 0.1% to $57.7 billion. Although the increase is negligible, the figures indicate that the U.S. economy is booming and riding high on strong industrial growth.Manufacturing Sector Expands, Factory Orders SurgeThe ISM Manufacturing Index came in at 59.3%. Although the index slipped 1.5%, the signs are positive, as 17 of the 18 manufacturing industries registered growth. The March PMI figure also marks overall economic growth for the 107th consecutive month.Moreover, the New Orders index came in at 61.9%, indicating strong demand. Exports orders also remained robust because of a weaker U.S. currency, while the Price Index is at its highest level since April 2011, registering 78.1%.Meanwhile, new orders for U.S. made goods increased in February. The growth can be attributed to robust demand for transportation equipment. Factory orders grew 1.2% owing to a 7% rise in transportation equipment, aided by a 26.2% jump in orders of commercial aircraft.   Our ChoicesThe latest data, which reflects strong orders for durable goods, is a clear indication that economic activity in the manufacturing sector is expanding. Moreover, the robust growth in orders for commercial aircraft and defense-capital goods is an indication of strong demand for U.S. made goods. Also, economists believe that investment growth is likely to pick up in the near term.Strong factory orders aided by steady demand for transportation equipment such as civil aircraft and defense-capital goods hint a bullish economic outlook. Naturally, investing in stocks that are likely to gain from strong durable goods’ order looks like a good option at this point.

1787,LMT,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Jan 29. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.6%. Moreover, we note that Seagate has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.5%.Seagate is gaining from the increasing adoption of its Nearline HDDs. We believe that Nearline’s rapid adoption will boost Seagate’s competitive position against Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report). The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology are yet another positive.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.40 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 1.5%. Further, earnings estimates have moved north over the last 30 days. However, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.83 billion, down roughly 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Aspects to Influence Q2 ResultsQ1 Earnings HighlightSeagate reported first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share of 96 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share.Revenues of $2.63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion but decreased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, both the top and bottom-line figures witnessed a sequential improvement, primarily attributable to strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.Notably, its shares have gained 69.5% in the last six months, while the industry recorded growth of 22.3%.Positive Preliminary Q2 ResultsThe stock gained from the positive second-quarter fiscal 2018 preliminary results.Seagate now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, the company recently announced a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba, which ensures continuous supply of NAND chips for Seagate’s expanding solid-state drive (SSD) portfolio.Improving HDD DemandHDD (hard disk drives) is improving primarily due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Increasing adoption of Seagate’s Nearline HDDs is likely to impact the to-be-reported quarter positively.Further, Seagate’s effort to augment areal density with the ramp up of its HAMR technology is a key catalyst.Strong PC Shipments Drives GrowthHints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive. Notably, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments touched 70.6 million units, up 0.7% year over year.These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: Seagate currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.40 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Seagatecurrently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

1788,LMT,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.03%. Its Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to register substantial sales growth in the quarter under review. However, order flow is likely to fuel the company’s bottom-line growth.Let's see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Is Vertex Divesture a Prudent Move? Contract price modifications at Vertex Aerospace unit raised concern about L3 Technologies’ Aerospace Systems segment’s growth.  In fact, the company has identified this segment to be its most challenging business and remains skeptical about this unit’s growth rate as well as profitability.To focus its resources on higher value-added and more profitable business, the company decided to divest the Vertex Aerospace business, at the onset of the fourth quarter. However, the divesture is likely to drive the Aerospace Systems segment’s revenues in the long run and not have any impact in the fourth quarter.Management further added that several other financial pursuits of this segment will impact its 2018 sales growth. Therefore, the Aerospace Systems segment will most likely suffer a decline in sales year over year.Evidently, the Zacks consensus estimate for the segment’s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at $539 million reflecting an annual decline of 49.9%.Orders Growth ­– A Key CatalystA smooth order flow tends to boost the bottom line of defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Considering its encouraging order performance, the company’s enhanced its 2017 earnings guidance. Notably the company increased its EPS midpoint by 10 cents to $8.85, reflecting 8% growth over 2016.Primarily lower taxes and high interest income, along with the favorable contract performance in sensors and electronics businesses led the company to increase its full-year earnings guidance.Notably the Zacks consensus estimate for 2017 earnings is $8.38 per share, representing 2.1% annual rise.L-3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  L-3 Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. Quote Unimpressive Top-line Estimates ­It is imperative to mention that the top-line estimates for L3 Technologies, for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, are unlikely to register an annual improvement. The company’s fourth-quarter sales expectation of $2.8-$2.9 billion also reflects 6% decline in organic growth. Probably this prediction led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings of $2.31 per share to reflect 2.9% annual decline.For 2017, the company lowered its estimated international sales to organic decline of 7% and that's primarily due to new business delays taking place in aerospace systems unit.Will Communication Systems Unit Play a Spoilsport?L3 Technologies is currently consolidating two traveling wave tubes businesses in communication systems segment, which is scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018. As a result, this segment is incurring solid traveling wave tube business consolidation expenses, which may hamper its performance in the fourth quarter.In line with this, our consensus estimate for the unit’s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at $544 million, reflecting 6.5% annual decline.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not indicate that L3 Technologies will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of -2.04%.

1789,LMT,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 25 before the opening bell.We expect the Missile Systems business unit of the defense major to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the quarter. Moreover, its overseas business expansion is also expected to boost results. Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon’s quarterly results.Missile Systems Unit Driving GrowthSegment-wise, Missile systems business unit that represent almost 30% of the company’s total business sales continues to be a major growth driver. The fourth quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit.  Notably, the company won a modification contract worth $300 million for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles and another modification contract worth $304.2 million to procure 618 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-ground missiles, containers, component parts/support equipment (spares) and engineering technical assistance. Moreover, at the end of the year the company won a $634.2-million deal for manufacturing the 31st Lot of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. Such order wins indicate solid demand for missiles manufactured by Raytheon and in turn is expected to boost sales.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $2,219 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.1%.In fact, buoyed on this segment’s double-digit sales growth, our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $6.83 billion for Raytheon. This represents an annual improvement of 9.6%.For 2017, the company expects to witness sales growth of 10% for the Missile Systems unit, driven by higher sales volume.International Operations: A Major PositiveApart from its strong forte in domestic front, international business expansion has always been a primary growth driver for Raytheon. Japan having pursuing missile defense solutions to protect its homeland, has created growth opportunities for Raytheon. The company is currently co-producing SM-3 Block IIA missiles with Japan. Moreover, Raytheoncontinues to make progress on several large Patriot opportunities in Europe, while in the Middle East the company is additional demand signal for early warning sensing and missile defense products. We believe once the company reports fourth-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Other Factors to ConsiderApart from its strong forte in missile defense, the company also enjoys a leading position in offering cybersecurity, particularly on the domestic front. Notably, at the onset of the fourth quarter, the Government Accountability Office dismissed the protest surrounding the Domino contract worth $1 billion and Raytheon is now actively working with the Department of Homeland Security on this largest single cybersecurity contracts ever awarded. We may expect further gains from this contract to get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter sales.Such a steady contract securing expectation led the company to increase its 2017 booking outlook by $500 million. The company also enhanced its 2017 sales outlook, citing solid expectations for fourth-quarter results.In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $25.4 billion, reflecting annual growth of 5.8%.The company also raised its 2017 earnings outlook.  In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is at $7.61, reflecting annual growth of 0.8%.Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise  Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company Quote What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model show that Raytheon is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1790,LMT,"Following President Trump’s tweet of the United States gearing up for a possible military strike on Syria, share price of several U.S. stocks tumbled. As geopolitical dispute continues to rise on escalating tension between Russia and the United States, the boarder market once again went on a bumpy ride.  As a result of this, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense indices dipped 0.7% in the last five trading sessions.Nevertheless, keeping with its trend, the industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon in the trailing five trading sessions.

1794,LMT,"Rising fears of a trade war between China and the United States unnerved investors, sending Wall Street on a bumpy ride for past few weeks. In particular, the market tumbled on President Trump’s proposal of imposing a tariff of $60 billion on Chinese imports. In retaliation China threatened to levy a hefty tariff on a number of American goods.  However, these developments did not have any major impact on the U.S. defense stocks. In fact, the recent joint venture (JV) that aircraft major Boeing formed with Saudi Arabian Military Industries is likely to keep the U.S. defense industry on a growth trajectory. The deal is also likely to boost the growth prospects of other defense majors as well. Evidently, a few of them have already started to win contracts from Saudi Arabia. Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the green over the past five trading sessions. Both the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index rose 1.7%, over that time frame. Moreover, keeping with its usual trend, the U.S. defense industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon over the trailing five sessions.Among the highlights of the last week, defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

This is a major achievement for Raytheon, since in spite of the U.S. State Department having cleared a potential $10.5 billion sale of four Patriot defense systems to Poland last November, the deal got stuck in cross-border negotiations.Per the agreement, Raytheon will continue to work with Polish defense companies and help them build key parts of the missile system (read more: Raytheon to Gain From US-Poland $4.8B Deal for Patriot). 2.

Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Air Force); and international partnership funds will be utilized to partially finance the task. The project is expected to be completed by July 2019.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft that comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. In fact, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. While, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities.

Evidently, the company’s top line grew 12% in the fourth quarter at its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin seems to be enjoying a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon each year and 2018 is no exception. Last month, the company won a modification contract worth $1.5 billion for the purchase of long lead material and parts related to low rate initial production (LRIP) of F-35 Lightning II air systems. Considering these contract wins, we expect the Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers as well as expressions of interest from other countries.Additionally, Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft.

It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewThanks to its diverse state-of-the art defense equipment, Lockheed Martin remains the largest U.S. defense contractor. Notably, the F-35 program continues to be a primary growth driver for the company.  Evidently, Lockheed Martin witnessed 12% top-line growth in the fourth quarter for its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program. The company delivered 66 F-35 aircraft that represents an annual growth of 44% in 2017. Management expects this momentum to continue and the company to deliver approximately 90 jets in 2018, reflecting year-over-year growth of 35%. Over the next few years, Lockheed Martin expects to achieve full-rate production for F-35.In terms of delivery, till date the company has dispatched more than 265 F-35 jets to the United States and international customers. Production of the F-35 aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Apart from its strong demand scenario in the domestic market, the F-35 program enjoys a solid forte in the international front as well.  Evidently, Norway received its first three conventional, take-off and landing F-35As, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover in 2017, seven of Lockheed Martin’s 11 international customers accepted the F-35 deliveries. This shows the notable demand F-35 enjoys in the international market as well.According to a report by Reuters, Germany’s 85 Tornado jets will go out of service by 2030. In relation to this the country has identified F-35 along with Boeing’s F-15 and F/A-18E/F jets as their next best alternatives. If chosen as the ultimate jet for the country, it goes without saying that F-35 program will witness a major surge in its growth.Currently, the company expects to generate revenues in the range of $50.0-$51.5 billion in 2018. We believe winning such orders, like the latest one, will entitle Lockheed Martin to achieve these targets.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have moved up 38.1% over a year, underperforming the 57.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the company’s top-line growth. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1798,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a $195-million modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kits. The contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah.Details of the DealPer the terms, Boeing’s Defense Space and Security segment will manufacture additional JDAM tail kits. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $927.6 million, if the options included in the contract are exercised.Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be completed by Jan 30, 2020. Boeing will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2019 procurement funds to finance the order.A Brief Note on JDAMThe JDAM is a low-cost guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurately guided ""smart"" weapons. The JDAM kit consists of a new tail section that comprises an inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) and body strakes for additional stability and lift. With the help of JDAM, bombs can be accurately delivered in any weather conditions.The U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and militaries of more than 26 countries employ JDAM. Its first operational use was during Operation Allied Force in the Balkans in 1999. JDAM has been used extensively in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and most recently in NATO’s Operation Unified Protector in Libya.Our ViewBoeing’s Defense Space and Security segment has reflected a solid year in terms of revenues and margins along with securing some key awards and achieving critical program milestones, including its ongoing progress on the tanker program.Evidently, during the fourth quarter, Boeing’s Defense Space and Security business clinched a massive $10 billion of new orders that included foreign military sales contracts worth $6.2 billion from the Qatar Emiri Air Force.Considering the $700-billion fiscal 2018 defense policy bill sanctioned last September by the U.S. Senate, a smooth inflow of orders for Boeing’s defense products and equipment is expected.Moreover, the company has of late been witnessing solid funding support above the President's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and space launch system. Thus, we expect Boeing to win more defense contracts in the days to come, which in turn will help it maintain its position as one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors worldwide.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) Quote Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 112.8% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 57.2%.

1799,LMT,"On Jan 19, Defense Secretary Jamis Mattis finally unveiled the highly awaited National Defense Strategy for 2018. Speaking at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Mattiss warned that the United States’ competitive edge has “eroded in every domain of warfare” and is “continually eroding” even now.Mattiss went on to outline a new strategy which focuses on cementing alliances, improving coordination with the State Department and elicit steady financial backing from Congress. One of the major priorities of the new strategy was to increase investments in various areas ranging from nuclear and cyber warfare to space operations and capabilities.This new strategy is another reminder that improving the capabilities of the defense services is at the top of the Trump administration’s agenda. The document has also been released at a time when major defense stocks are preparing to report earnings numbers.With General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Jan 24 and Jan 29, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both these stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other defense stocks reporting earnings this month include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Price PerformanceIn terms of price performance, Lockheed Martin is a clear winner. Both stocks have underperformed the broader industry, which has gained 13.4% over the last three months. However, Lockheed Martin has gained 6% over this period, clearly outperforming General Dynamics which has lost -1.4%. ValuationSince the defense sector is capital intensive, the most appropriate ratio to value companies is EV/EBITDA. Additionally, it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not impacted by differing capital structures and excludes the impact of non-cash expenses.  Coming to the two defense stocks, with an EV/EBITDA value of 15.64, Lockheed Martin is overvalued relative to the rest of the industry. General Dynamics holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 13.55, making it undervalued relative to the rest of the industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.68.Return on CapitalReturn on capital or return on capital employed is a suitable metric to compare the profitability of companies relying on the quantum of capital that they utilize. The capital utilized or employed is the total capital that the company requires to return a profit. This ratio is particularly useful when the objective is to compare the performance of companies which belong to capital intensive sectors. This is because unlike other profitability metrics like return on equity (ROE), return on capital takes into account debt and other related liabilities.Such an approach ensures a more holistic picture of companies which utilize a significant amount of debt. Here, Lockheed Martin is clearly ahead with a return on equity level of 23.3%, which is higher than the General Dynamic’s level of 21.6%.Debt to AssetsThe debt to assets ratio or debt ratio is utilized to gauge the amount of leverage a company utilizes. A higher ratio necessarily indicates a higher amount of leverage, which raises the financial risk involved. Industries which are capital intensive in nature usually have a relatively higher debt ratio. Lockheed Martin is saddled with a relatively poor debt-to-assets level of 29.2%. This round easily goes to General Dynamics, which has a debt-to-assets ratio of around 14%, which is lower than Lockheed Martin’s as well as that of the broader industry, which has a debt-to-assets ratio of 17.1%.Dividend YieldLockheed Martin’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 2.41%. With a dividend yield of 1.6%, General Dynamics’ shareholders earn a lower dividend yield than those of Lockheed Martin as well as the broader industry, which has an average dividend yield of 1.7%. Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Lockheed Martin has delivered earnings surprises in three of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, General Dynamics has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters. While General Dynamics has an average earnings surprise of 3.4%, Lockheed Martin stands out with an average earnings surprise of 4.9%.When considering Earnings ESP values, Lockheed Martin holds the edge with a reading of +0.31%, higher than General Dynamics’ figure of +0.19%. At the same time, Lockheed Martin’s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 3.8% over the last 30 days, higher than General Dynamics’ level of 3.7%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that there is little to choose between the stocks when considering ranks, since both carry a Zacks Rank #2. But General Dynamics does hold an edge over Lockheed Martin when considering valuation and debt ratios.However, Lockheed Martin is superior when considering price performance, dividend yield, estimate revisions and a more detailed earnings history. What clinches the case for Lockheed Martin over General Dynamics is a higher ESP value, which makes it a better choice ahead of upcoming earnings results.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1803,LMT,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 24, before the opening bell.We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon will continue to drive the military shipbuilder’s revenues in the fourth quarter. However, Aerospace segment may face margin pressure in the quarter under review, as is evident from the expected annual decline in operating earnings.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.Order Growth to Boost SalesOrder flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth quarter sales is $8.4 billion, reflecting 2.5% year-over-year growth. Management also remained optimistic about the company’s fourth quarter order growth, which led it to project revenue growth of 15%, sequentially.Notably, the contracts that General Dynamics secured in the fourth quarter, include a $2.6-billion deal for upgrading 786 M1A1 configured Abrams vehicles in relation to the newly configured M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3; an agreement worth $198 million for the procurement, manufacturing, testing and delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR) systems.Moreover, the company’s business division, Electric Boat, secured a modification contract worth $432 million for providing fiscal 2018 lead yard services and development studies and design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.The contract wins throughout 2017 will surely bolster the company’s full-year revenues, as is evident from the 4.9% growth reflected by our consensus estimate for the full year.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteWill Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport?During second-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics’ management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year, citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport. In line with this, fourth-quarter consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,930 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.2%. Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 20.6% to $348 million, per our consensus estimate.Although the company continues to have a strong forte in the Gulfstream business, which exhibits strong pipeline growth, a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment’s overall fourth-quarter growth. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, other three business units of General Dynamics indicate positive annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.On the bottom-line front, a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to result in lower earnings. Evidently, our consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ earnings is pegged at $2.36 per share, reflecting 9.9% annual decline. The full-year earnings estimate of $9.81 per share also represents a 0.6% drop.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model show that General Dynamics is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

1805,LMT,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $209.98 during yesterday’s trading session before closing a tad lower at $209.46. The stock has delivered a one-year return of about 40.9%.Over the past 52 weeks, L3 Technologies’ share price has ranged from a low of $146.88 to a high of $209.98. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.55 million.What is Driving L3 Technologies?L3 Technologies is a consistent performer and has reported positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.13%. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate (three to five years) is 6.78%.Thanks to its quality product offerings, the company continuously receives contracts from the U.S. defense establishments and foreign governments. Funded backlog at the end of third- quarter 2017 was $9 billion, reflecting sequential growth of 5.8%.Apart from generating substantial organic revenue growth, thanks to its varied product range, L3 Technologies gains from inorganic growth. The strategic acquisitions made by the company have widened its market and created more opportunities.In addition to its strong presence in the U.S. defense space, the company continues to enjoy a steady flow of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts. The company is expected to benefit from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and under FMS agreements between the U.S. government and foreign governments.Other Defense Players Moving UpTrump’s presidency has been a boon for the  Zacks Aerospace sector , which was grappling with the budget sequestration implemented by the prior government. The fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget, reflecting a 10% hike from the FY16 level, was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017.  Notably, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights.The increase in the defense budget will also result in new orders for the major defense contractors and will have a positive impact on their performance and prices. Apart from L3 Technologies, other defense operators like Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) also touched their respective 52-week highs yesterday.Price MovementL3 Technologies has returned 40.9% in the past year, which is in line with the industry’s gain but much better than the S&P 500’s return of 23.2%.The company’s performance is driven by its non-platform-centric focus and broad diversification of programs.Zacks RankL3 Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1806,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT) business unit, Sikorsky Aircraft, recently secured a contract for manufacturing eight UH-60M aircraft for Saudi Arabian National Guard Forces and nine similar aircraft for the RoyalSaudi Land Forces Airborne Special Security Forces.Details of the DealValued at $193 million, this foreign military sales (FMS) contract to Saudi Arabia was awarded by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 foreign military sales to fund the work, which is likely to be executed in Stratford, CT. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2022.A Brief Note on UH-60M AircraftThe UH-60M Blackhawk helicopters are an upgraded version of combat-proven UH-60 helicopter. The Multi-mission UH-60M is the latest in the Black Hawk helicopter family and is more capable, survivable, maintainable, powerful and effective than its predecessors. The UH-60M provides additional payload and range, advanced digital avionics, better handling qualities and situational awareness, active vibration control, improved survivability and improved performance using high-speed machined parts.The centerpiece of the UH-60M Black hawk helicopter is an advanced digital avionics suite that provides improved situational awareness and interoperability with the Future Combat System. It is more effective with its integrated digital cockpit, moving map display, enhanced GPS/INS system and fully coupled flight controls.Our ViewLockheed Martin had acquired Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. in November 2015 that boosted the former’s position as the world’s largest defense contractor, strengthening its military helicopter business. The acquisition added Sikorsky’s world-known aircraft, Black Hawk, along with different variants of combat and commercial choppers to Lockheed Martin's helicopter product line.In the third quarter of 2017, the Sikorsky business saw a drop in net sales margin. However, for 2017, the company has increased its sales outlook, on expectations of contributions from its Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) unit, which includes the Sikorsky unit. We believe generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts like the latest one, will allow Lockheed Martin to make a rebound in the RMS business unit.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up about 32.1% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 53.9%. This underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (AJRD  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Curtiss-Wright Corp. (CW  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc.

1807,LMT,"President Trump signed into law a bipartisan budget deal that will keep the government funded for two years and eliminate the constant fear of shutdowns. Senate Republicans and Democrats agreed to provide a massive boost to spending levels for Pentagon and domestic programs, including infrastructure. Trump has already urged for an uptick in defense spending to build nuclear arsenal, while raised concerns over the nation’s “crumbling infrastructure”.As outlays are expected to increase for defense and infrastructure programs, it seems wise to invest in such areas for healthy returns.The 2-Year PactTrump deal was signed on Feb 9, following the approval of the budget bill in Congress. The spending pact suspends a 2011 budget law that had set hard caps on discretionary outlays and was backed by Conservatives.Fiscal conservative Rand Paul, R-Ky delayed the vote in the Senate resulting in a partial government shutdown. Nonetheless, the Senate passed the measure 71-28 and the shutdown was averted. The bill also faced opposition from conservatives in the House. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tried to delay the vote in the House. But, the House eventually passed the measure 240-186.The Bipartisan Budget Act accomplished a few long-awaited priorities. U.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion for the next two years to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years.Congress has time and again voted to raise budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was signed in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Details on the DealThe spending pact will raise defense budget by $165 billion over two years. While spending caps will be lifted by $80 billion in the current fiscal, $85 billion will be hiked next year. This in turn will help the military receive a minimum of $1.4 trillion through September 2019 to help buy fighter jets, ships and other equipment. This level of funding is also expected to improve the country’s missiles and nuclear bombers.The bipartisan deal is a major victory for military hawks. After all, Republicans had to battle fiscal conservatives in their own party for years to lift restrictions on defense outlays. Moreover, defense spending was raised in 2010 last. Since then, military commanders faced strict restriction on annual defense spending by the Budget Control Act, a 2011 deal reached by then-President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans.The budget deal, in the meantime, will boost domestic spending by hundreds of billions of dollars. Nondefense spending caps will be raised by $63 billion in the current fiscal, while $68 billion will be increased next year. Out of such spending, a large chunk will be used for infrastructural programs. About $20 billion will be used for infrastructure programs such as surface transportation, rural water, wastewater systems, to name a few, over the two years.Trump Calls for Higher Defense, Infrastructure OutlaysTrump has already called on Congress to put an end to caps on defense spending so that the United States can modernize its nuclear arsenal. He said that better nuclear weapons are required to counter rogue organizations, terror outfits and countries such as China and Russia.After signing the budget pact, Trump tweeted “military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!”Trump has also urged for huge infrastructure spending. He wants to rebuild infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and railways. This is something that he has been promising since his campaign days. He wants the Congress to pass a legislation to stimulate a minimum of $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure outlays. He wants the approval process to reduce to two years if not one.5 Top GainersThe two-year budget deal will provide a significant boost to spending levels for both defense and nondefense programs like infrastructure.

1808,LMT," Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.The aviation electronics maker posted in-line earnings in the last quarter. Impressively, Rockwell Collins surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.61%.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Rockwell Collins' quarterly results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Rockwell Collins is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.43%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Rockwell Collins carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayRockwell Collins remains the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers. The company’s balanced exposure to both types of customers allows it to use government funding to develop products for the dual-end market.Particularly, the $700-billion defense bill policy has improved the outlook for defense stocks like Rockwell Collins manifold. Evidently, its share price gained 5.6% since Senate approved the bill, last September.In the same month, Rockwell Collins entered into an agreement to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation for $30 billion. The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.Notably, shareholders of Rockwell Collins will be given all-cash consideration of $140 per share, reflecting a premium of nearly 7.5% from the company’s closing price of $130.29 on Sep 1, 2017. Interestingly, shares of Rockwell Collins is presently trading near the acquisition price but has not yet attained it. Considering this, investors even now have a possibility of gaining from this stock.Moreover, even after announcement of its takeover, Azerbaijan Airlines selected Rockwell Collins in November 2017, to provide its global, high-speed broadband in-flight connectivity, overhead in-flight entertainment and a full suite of advanced avionics — including Rockwell Collins’ MultiScan ThreatTrack weather radar — for 10 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.We believe this contract will boost the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.9 billion reflects a solid annual surge of 66.6%.This shows the huge demand that Rockwells Collins’ products enjoy worldwide and is thus a treasured acquiree in the Aerospace-Defense industry.Moreover the company’s B/E Aerospace buyout, which it completed in April 2017, has been adding value to its top and bottom-line growth since then. In fiscal 2017, its U.S. sales improved 18% as a result of improved accretions from this takeover. In line with this, we expect this acquisition to boost the company’s earnings in the first quarter as well and thus our consensus estimate for earnings of $1.53 per share reflects an annual growth of 27.5%.Rockwell Collins, Inc.

1809,LMT,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Lockheed Martin is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LMT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.07 per share for LMT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LMT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.31% heading into earnings season.Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that LMT has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Lockheed Martin, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1813,LMT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) on Mar 30, 2018 announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with Saudi Arabian Military Industries (“SAMI”) to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia.Interestingly, this tie-up got finalized a week after President Trump praised Saudi Arabia for being a ‘big purchaser’ of American weaponries, during Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s visit to the White House. The latest JV further strengthens the relationship between the oil-rich Saudi Arabia and largest weapon exporter America.Strengthening Boeing-Saudi Arabia RelationshipOver the years, Boeing has developed a genial relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (""KSA""). The former U.S. President Roosevelt’s gifting of a DC-3 Dakota jet to the Saudi king in 1945 enabled the aircraft major to initiate commercial business in the nation. The company’s defense unit started doing business with the nation following Royal Saudi Air Force’s (“RSAF”) purchase of F-15C/D fleet in 1978. Notably, this remains the mainstay of KSA’s air defense till date.Since then, Boeing has been winning a number of contracts from the KSA for advanced military weaponries. Of the latest notable deals, in August 2017, the company won a $223-million contract for supplying eight CH-47F new helicopters to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (""RSLFAC""). It goes without saying that the latest JV will allow the company to expand its footprint in KSA, which has bountiful prospects.Also, through the latest JV the Saudis aim to progress with their Vision 2030 program — a project aimed at auguring KSA’s long-term economic growth. The latest MoA is expected to improve KSA’s local research, design, engineering, manufacturing and MRO abilities, with help from Boeing. The JV will also help to enhance maintenance capabilities and lower the support cost of the Saudi military fleet as well as prepare them to be ready for action at short notice. This, in turn, is likely to help enhance the performance of the Saudi army.Additionally, the agreement is expected to help create 6,000 jobs and training opportunities for the Saudi youth, support local content and improve Saudization levels in the industry. Boeing has also agreed to provide the technological know-how required to install weaponry on the aircraft included in the JV as well as localize the supply chain for spare parts. We believe, with Vision 2030 in view this JV will help the company to earn more profits from this oil-rich nation.Defense Majors to Tread Growth Track: Here’s WhyIn response to Trump’s plaudits last month, Salman committed to invest $400 billion in the United States over the long run. Last year, the two nations signed an arms deal with a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years. With Saudi Arabia being America's one of the most important partners in the Middle East, these investment strategies show the huge growth prospects that the U.S defense primes enjoy in KSA.In fact, the White House informed the Congress on Mar 22 that it plans to approve a $1-billion arms sale deal to Saudi Arabia, a package that includes vending about 6,700 U.S.-built TOW anti-tank missiles, along with providing support, maintenance and spare parts for American tanks, helicopters and other equipment already in Saudi Arabia's arsenal.  We believe the latest JV to be a by-product of that plan.Now that Boeing has signed the MoA with the kingdom, in light of the recent investment strategies we expect other defense majors, who already enjoy a good business rapport with KSA, to follow suit. While a few of them are already getting contracts from the Kingdom, a few other are expected to win such deals soon, as part of the$1-billion plan.3 Defense Stocks to Keep in Your Watch ListWhile Boeing will certainly remain on a growth trajectory now owing to the recent MoA it has signed with SAMI, let us turn our focus toward other defense stocks that have the potential to gain substantially from the recent investment strategies adopted by the Saudi prince. These defense primes not only have a solid growth prospect but are also market outperformers. Moreover, since these stocks also boast a favorable Zacks Rank, they are worth keeping in your watch list.Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) is the largest defense contractor in the world. Following the U.S. administration’s plan to approve $1-billion arms deal, the company has won a modification deal worth $279 million for enhancement of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. Also per the contract, the company will provide cost-reduction initiative (CRI) missiles and associated ground support equipment to Saudi Arabia.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.62%.

Thanks to the $1-billion deal’s proposal, the State Department announced that it is planning to approve the possible sale of Abrams tanks and armored vehicles worth $300 million to Saudi Arabia. With General Dynamics being the primary contractor for these tanks, this plan’s approval will surely boost its profit margin.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4.02%.

Markedly, the company received a number of orders for both commercial as well as military jets in the first quarter.Such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales.

With the commercial business constituting almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we expect the unit to drive the company’s first-quarter earnings.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1820,LMT,"FLIR Systems Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 14.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%. FLIR Systems has an average positive surprise of 1.3% in the trailing four quarters.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +0.36%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsOver the past few quarters, FLIR Systems’ diverse business portfolio (in terms of geographies, products and markets) has remained a staple growth driver. Further, the company’s restructuring efforts in the past five years have helped it reap synergies and drive profitable growth, combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions. Solid execution along with streamlined business is helping the company drive solid improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, operating margin and net income. Going forward, we believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels will help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth.Moreover, the company remains strongly committed toward introduction of innovative products to expand its customer base and enhance foothold in new markets. For instance, since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the last reported quarter, including, three thermal imaging-equipped test and measurement products, Lepton microcamera thermal core, Infrared Guided Measurement and FLIR FB-Series are anticipated to bolster sales for the upcoming quarter. This apart, the company’s diligent CDMQ model is expected to boost the sales of its government as well as military business.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Surveillance segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $166 million compared with third-quarter revenues of $147 million. Revenues from Instruments segment are also anticipated to be high with estimate of $103 million compared with reported revenues of $91 million in the prior quarter. The company’s acquired businesses, including Point Grey, Armasight and Prox Dynamics are expected to contribute to fiscal fourth-quarter sales as well.However the fact remains that, poor economic conditions across the company’s key operating regions may hamper capital investment and consumer spending, consequently weighing on its profitability. Also, the company’s business remains prone to political uncertainty and currency volatility globally, adding to concerns.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Churchill Downs, Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.03% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1821,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 29, before the opening bell.Order procurement continues to be a primary growth driver for this defense major’s fourth-quarter results. The company is expected to overcome the weakness in operating profits in the quarter to be reported.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Lockheed Martin’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins: Key CatalystBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from the Pentagon and its overseas clients, courtesy of its varied defense and military product offerings.Among the contracts that this defense major won in the fourth quarter, the significant ones include a $7-billion deal for its Aeronautics business division secured for offering comprehensive F-22 air vehicle sustainment, a $945-million contract for the production of PAC-3 Missiles, and a $419-million modification contract for the procurement of Trident II (D5) missile production.The company also won a $260-million modification contract to upgrade four P-3B aircraft and a $158.5-million contract for the second phase of the German Navy P-3C Mission System Refresh program.Such a steady flow of orders will certainly boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $14.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.27%.Operating Profit: A Solid ShowDuring the third quarter, Lockheed Martin’s segment operating profit suffered timing-related shortfall. However, the company's fourth-quarter results are expected to show an improvement in the same. Impressively,management has raised the 2017 operating profit outlook by $20 million and total operating profit view by $240 million. In particular, the company lifted its profit outlook for Aeronautics, Space Systems as well as Missiles and Fire Control segments by a collective $35 million. For the Rotary and Mission Systems unit, the company foresees a drop in operating profits.In line with this, our consensus estimate predicted 16.3% growth in fourth-quarter operating profit for Aeronautics business segment. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, management has raised the sales outlook for the company’s Space Systems, Rotary and Mission Systems as well as Missiles and Fire Control business units. However, the sales outlook for theAeronautics business was slashed owing to an updated forecast of subcontractor production costs that were incurred in previous quarter.On the bright side, Lockheed Martin lifted its earnings per share outlook by 55 cents based on the increase in segment operating profits and the improvement in unallocated items. In line with this, the ZacksConsensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.06 per share, reflecting a 24.9% increase year over year.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation Quote What Our Zacks Model UnveilsLockheed Martin has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of +0.31%.

1822,LMT,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Nov 30.Notably, the Gorilla Glass maker has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 8.7%. In the last quarter, Corning delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.9%.We expect Corning’s results to be driven by strength in the optical communications segment, primarily owing to strong demand for fiber products. Moreover, solid demand for Gorilla Glass 5, expanding footprint in the automotive market and acquisition of 3M’s communication market division are other catalysts.Corning reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Earnings increased 2.4%, year over year and sequentially.Growth was driven by improvement in revenues. Core revenues increased 6% year over year to $2.70 billion, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 billion. Revenues increased 4.2% on a sequential basis.The results reflect strength in the company’s Optical Communications and Specialty Materials business lines.Corning’s shares have returned 7.7% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.3% rally.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 47 cent, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Notably, the earnings estimate has moved north over the last 30 days. Further, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.63 billion, up roughly 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Acquisitions and Product Adoptions: Key CatalystsCorning recently announced that it has agreed to take over 3M Company’s (MMM  -  Free Report) Communication Markets Division completely in an all-cash deal for approximately $900 million. Acquisition of 3M’s communication market division will not only strengthen the company’s Optical Communications worldwide market access but also expand Corning’s product portfolio. Moreover, it expects the deal to add 7-9 cents to 2019 earnings.Considering growth witnessed by the Optical Communications market in the last few years, this deal will boost Corning’s revenues and increase overall market share.Further, Ford’s use of Corning Gorilla Glass for its Ford GT is aiding the company to successfully penetrate the 6 billion-square-foot auto glazing market. Corning has also announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to manufacture, develop and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. This venture has allowed the company to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer.We expect sales to benefit from strong demand for fiber products, as reflected by the Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) deal, which was signed in April.Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (GPFs) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business.Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase high-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.Environmental Technologies sales are projected to increase by low-teens percentage, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by low-to-mid teens percentage range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials are currently pegged at $275 million and $389 million, respectively.The Life Sciences business will grow mid-single digit percentage from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Life Sciences revenues is currently pegged at $217 million.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1823,LMT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with flydubai for 225 737 MAX airplanes. Valued at $27 billion at current list prices, the order was awarded during the 2017 Dubai Air Show. It marks the largest-ever single-aisle jet order from a Middle East carrier.Order in DetailThe agreement comprises a commitment for 175 MAX airplanes and purchase rights for 50 additional MAX jets. Among these 175 airplanes, the order includes over 50 737 MAX 10s — the newest and largest member of the 737 MAX family — along with other MAX 8 and MAX 9 airplanes.With this third aircraft deal, flydubai, which started flights in 2009, will surpass its previous record order of 75 MAX jets and 11 Next-Generation 737-800s that was signed at the 2013 Dubai Airshow. The current fleet of the carrier is all Boeing and at present only operates 737-8s.Delivery of the 175 planes will commence in 2019 and be spread across 10 years with some coming ahead of the 2013 order. Given the size of the deal, it is expected that flydubai will get a discount on the list price of the aircraft.Deals Inked at the Ongoing Dubai Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising due to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic.Of late, at the Dubai Air Show, this aircraft giant received an order from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 additional 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion. Additionally, the company secured an order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters, valued at approximately $1.9 billion, from Azerbaijan Airlines.Apart from this, the company sealed a deal for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates,  the largest airline in the Middle East.  The purchase order also comes with equipments related to the 787-10 fleet, valued at $15.1 billion.Given the enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is witnessing significant progress, especially in the single-aisle market.Global Demand for Single-Aisle AircraftBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. The figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind the increase in demand, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges. Recently, Airbus received an order for 430 single-aisle airplanes valued at $49.5 billion at the Dubai Air Show.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.The 737 model is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from 92 customers.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has surged 77.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 35.6%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions.  The stock also performed better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp.

1824,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Sikorsky Aircraft, recently secured a modification contract for supplying consumable spare parts used in various weapon systems. The original deal was a five-year base contract with one five-year option period for numerous aircraft platform spare supply parts.About the DealValued at $49 million, this contract has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VI. Sikorsky will offer the spare parts for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and foreign military sales.The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 defense working capital funds to finance the work, which will be executed in Connecticut. It is scheduled to be completed by Jun 30, 2020.Factors in Favor of Lockheed MartinBeing Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin offers a diverse portfolio of global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies. The company’s Global Supply Chain Services (“GSCS”) offer hardware replacements for both structural and consumable parts along with a certified vendor program.For over 10 years, GSCS has been providing aircraft tires to all Navy and Marine Corps aviation activities worldwide. Within this period, the company’s performance included a 100% fill rate and on-time global delivery of 98.4%, resulting in a 400% reduction in retail inventories for Navy and Marine Corps activities within the United States.Under various programs, GSCS also provides crucial support to the three U.S. Air Force depots by maintaining a constant supply of miscellaneous, small consumable parts in more than 295,000 parts bins with 90,000 unique line items at a bin fill rate of over 99.78%. In terms of international business as well, GSCS offers support services to 55 international and commercial customers, with over 40 years of experience.Our ViewIn November 2015, Lockheed Martin had purchased Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report). The deal boosted Lockheed Martin’s military helicopter business and strengthened its position as the world’s largest defense contractor. Also, this acquisition added Sikorsky’s world-known aircraft, Black Hawk and a handful of combat and commercial choppers to Lockheed Martin's helicopter product line.Going ahead, management expects to witness improved cash flows from the Sikorsky business unit in 2018 indicating possibilities of this business’ expansion in the near term. We believe generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, like the latest one, can certainly help the company achieve its desired business expansion, going ahead.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.4% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 34.5% gain. This underperformance can be attributable to the earlier budget cuts that might have put pressure on the top line as well as intense competition from some of the largest defense primes like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).  Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions.  The stock also performed better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp.

1826,LMT,"Defense behemoth Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Rotary Mission Systems business division secured a modification contract, to support the AEGIS weapon system (AWS). Work related to this deal is expected to be over by November 2018.Details of the DealValued at $60.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will conduct  ship integration and test of the AWS for AWS baselines through Advanced Capability Build 12.Majority of the work will be executed in Camden, NJ; Norfolk, VA; Pascagoula, MS; and Moorestown, NJ.  Fiscal 2012 and 2013 shipbuilding and conversion; fiscal 2017 and 2018 other procurement; and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partly finance the deal.A Brief-Note on AWSLockheed Martin’s AWS is the world’s premier naval air defense system and the sea-based element of the United States’ Ballistic Missile Defense System. It is a seamlessly integrated radar and missile system, which has the capability to provide protection against advanced air, surface and subsurface threats.A key component of the AWS is the SPY-1 multi-function phased array radar — the world’s most advanced and versatile maritime radar.Our ViewLockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders.At present, Lockheed Martin's Aegis system is a sought-after maritime weapon system for nations like Australia, Japan, Norway and Spain. In the third quarter the RMS unit’s revenues witnessed a year-over-year improvement. Going ahead, the latest contract for the AWS is expected to provide further impetus to this unit’s growth.Additionally, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy, authorizing the United States’ defense spending worth $700 billion, has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.7% over a year underperforming the industry’s 31% gain.

1827,LMT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently sealed a deal for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates — the largest airline in the Middle East.  Notably, the aircraft giant received the order on the very first day of the Dubai Airshow.Details of the DealDeliveries of these twin aisle jets are scheduled to commence from 2022, while the 40th jet of the lot is expected to be delivered by 2030. The purchase order, in addition to the 40 jets, comes with equipments related to the 787-10 fleet, with a total value of $15.1 billion as per the current list price.Notably, Emirates will use some of these planes to replace its existing fleet of 777 jets, to maintain a young and efficient fleet; while the rest will boost the airline’s future network growth.A Brief Note on 787-10 DreamlinerBoeing’s 787-10 is the largest member of 787 Dreamliner family, which is 5.5 meters (18 ft) longer than the 787-9 model. It shares more than 95% commonality with its predecessors. It is also the fastest-selling twin-aisle airplane in history, which comes with low fuel use and operating costs.Notably, the latest order from Emirates takes the total number of new 787 orders and commitments  for Boeing this year to more than 180; and more than 210 orders and commitments for the 787-10 overall.Benefits of the DealEmirates became the first and sole carrier to operate an all-Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet in November 2016. Now, subsequent to signing of the latest deal, airlines management considers the new 787-10 fleet to strongly complement its existing fleet, thereby offering it more flexibility to operate in a wide range of destinations. Moreover, this new fleet will offer 25% better fuel efficiency per seat and emissions than the existing airplanes.This in turn will boost Emirates’ strategy to expand its global route network.On the other hand, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce formula, such a multi-billion dollar deal will support more than 75,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs.  Therefore, apart from boosting Boeing’s revenue growth, this deal will bolster the U.S. economy as a whole.Our ViewBoeing raised its 20-year forecast for jetliner demand by 3.6% at June’s Paris Air Show. Per its current outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. Notably, while single-aisle jets are expected to be the major driver behind this demand growth, their twin-aisle counterparts are projected to witness a solid upward traction.In this context, Boeing projects demand for 9,130 new twin-aisle planes in the 2017-2036 period. The company estimates that the total value of all wide-body planes (comprising small, medium or large) sold over the period will be $2.8 trillion compared with $3.2 trillion for the narrow-body variety.It goes without saying that prospects for twin-aisle jet planes is impressive, with more airlines shifting to small and medium/large wide-body airplanes like Boeing’s 787 and 777X fleets. Boeing’s latest deal with Emirates is a bright instance for that.It is imperative to mention here that although Boeing and Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report) dominate the commercial aerospace manufacturing market as major airlines worldwide uses their airplanes; the latter has been lagging behind the in terms of winning commercial orders lately.According to BBC News, Emirates’ chairman said that the airline chose 787-10 over Airbus A350 fleet, which we believe reflects Boeing’s 787 fleets’ efficiency over its arch rivals’ twin-aisle fleet.  In fact, while Emirates, is already the biggest customer for Boeing's 777 fleet, the latest order has raised the airline’s cost of purchase of Boeing aircraft to $90 billion.  This reflects the long-term partnership that Emirates and Boeing shares and while the former is enhancing its network, we may expect Boeing to win more such deals for its commercial jets going ahead.Price PerformanceShare price of Boeing has surged 73.9% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 29.9%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions. The stock’s performance is better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), which missed the industry mark.  Zacks Rank Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1828,LMT,"Northrop Grumman Systems Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a contract to support the AAQ-24 large aircraft infrared counter-measure (LAIRCM) direct sales public private partnership for repair of 34 national stock numbers. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Dec 14, 2022 and will be executed in Warner Robins, GA.Valued at $444.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Sustainment Center, Robins Air Force Base, GA. Foreign military funds (FMS) funds will be used to partly finance the task.A Brief Note on LAIRCMThe primary purpose of Northrop Grumman’s LAIRCM program is to protect large aircraft from man-portable missiles. On identifying a missile, LAIRCM activates a high-intensity, laser-based countermeasure system to track and destroy the missile automatically.Our ViewOf late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour. A well-equipped nation like the United States thus will always want to remain prepared for sudden attacks.Moreover, over the past few months, repeated missile threats from North Korea have forced the United States to ramp up its focus toward its missile defense space. Undoubtedly, this has led the Trump administration to multiply its arsenal treasury, both in terms of attacking missiles as well as accumulating protective measures like LAIRCM.Currently, Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system is the only DIRCM system in production that protects an aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. LAIRCM is one variant of such a DIRCM. Considering the present situation in the nation and Northrop Grumman’s combat-proven LAIRCM, more contracts like the recent one can be expected to boost Northrop’s sales.Moreover, per Markets and Markets research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022. This further reflects substantial growth prospects for defense majors like Northrop Grumman that offer counter-measures against missile threats.Further, the Senate’s approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act this September indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.Price PerformanceNorthrop Grumman’s stock has returned 15.5% in last three months, outperforming the 10.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven bythe fact that the company’s product line is well positioned in high priority categories, such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. Zacks Rank Northrop Grumman currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1829,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. ((LMT  -  Free Report)) recently secured a contract for providing cyber security support services to sustain the analysis, design, development, test, integration, deployment and operation of information technology systems and services for the cyber security workforce. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2022.Valued at $77.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA. Majority of the work will be carried out in China Lake, CA. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 working capital funds (Navy) to partially finance the deal.Cyber Security SolutionsLockheed Martin is a leading provider of a full spectrum of cyber capabilities supporting the defense and intelligence community customers. The company offers cyber security solutions to defend and exploit enterprise IT networks, radiofrequency spectrums, and military platforms on land, sea and air.The company’s Cyber Kill Chain framework is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense model built for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions and enriches an analyst’s understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.Our ViewFor the U.S. Navy, cyber security is critical because its ability to coordinate ships, planes and personnel depends heavily on computer networks and satellites. This paves way for a big defense contractor like Lockheed Martin to deliver extensive cyber solutions which enable the U.S. Defense to manage cyber intrusions, insider threats and supply chain vulnerabilities.Meanwhile, the fiscal 2018 budget allocated $1.5 billion to Homeland Security for countering cyber attacks, strengthening networking surveillance systems and protecting critical data-based infrastructure. This in turn is expected to help the company clinch more contracts related to cyber security.Notably, the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems business that offers cyber security solutions witnessed a mere 0.2% top-line rise in the third quarter of 2017. Despite this inappreciable top-line improvement, the company has raised its 2017 sales outlook for this business unit. We may expect this enhanced guidance to have been driven by anticipations of more such contract wins like the latest one.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied about 25.5% in a year compared with the broader industry’s 34%. This underperformance was primarily led by intense competition in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1830,LMT,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) business segment recently secured a contract worth $641.6 million to perform Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) test related activities for multiple radar platforms. Work related to this will be carried out in Huntsville, AL and Colorado Springs, CO.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL.  The BMDS test involves planning, executing, and analyzing sensor performance in BMDS flight tests and ground tests for each test event defined in the BMDS integrated master test plan. It also includes sensors modeling and simulation activities to include Open Systems Architecture Sensor Model (OSM) and Open Systems Architecture Signal Injector (OSI) development and maintenance, integration of OSI with hardware-in-the-loop radar representation, integration of OSI and OSM with the simulation framework, verification and validation support, and stakeholder/event support.Raytheon will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to partly finance the task. The ordering period is from Jan 12, 2018, through Jan 11, 2023, with a one-year option period provided in the contract.Features of IDS UnitRaytheon’s IDS segment enjoys a leading position in integrated air and missile defense; large land- and sea-based radar solutions; command, control, communications, computers, cyber and intelligence solutions; and naval combat and ship electronic systems. The segment delivers combat-proven performance against the complete spectrum of airborne and ballistic missile threats and is a world leader in the technology, development, and production of sensors and mission systems.Our ViewThe United States and developed nations of Europe already enjoy a dominant position in the defense industry. With increasing geo-political tensions across the globe, Asian nations like India and Japan have started to take initiatives to ramp up their arsenal. With rapid upgradation in technology, missile defense has emerged as an integral part of defense strategy for all countries.As a result, missile-makers like Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK  have ample growth opportunities in the global missile defense market. Evidently, the missile defense systems market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18%, from 2017 to 2027 with a value of $41 billion (according to ReportLinker).Raytheon has a strong forte in the multi-billion dollar missile defense market. Its proven interceptors, radars and space sensors provide protection against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, aircraft and other threats.Anticipating stronger bookings, Raytheon raised its fourth-quarter and full-year sales outlook for the IDS segment. Impressively, the company also expects to witness uplift in this segment during 2018, to which we believe notable contract wins like the latest one will contribute substantially.Price MovementRaytheon’s shares moved up about 35.3% in a year’s time compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.8%. The outperformance may have been driven by rising demand for the company’s missile systems from the Gulf countries and Asia Pacific, apart from domestic customers.  Zacks Rank Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This will be brought about by ensuring greater visibility to demand at the depot maintenance line. The contract will also result in reduced inventory and lower infrastructural costs. Further, value added logistics, engineering support as well as obsolescence management will be part of the company’s contract.What is Favoring Rockwell Collins?Widespread geo-political and socio-economic tensions have bolstered growth of the aerospace and defense industry for decades now. In recent times, escalating international terrorist attacks and emergence of civil wars have added impetus to the space. Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector have rallied 35% in the last 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500’s 23.8% gain.With a majority of macroeconomic factors favoring the sector, such outperformance can be expected to continue in the coming days. Further, given the increase in cyber attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability, there is a pressing need to boost security and defense by all countries.Not just Rockwell Collinsbut other major defense contractors in the nation like Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) are also putting their best foot forward to make the most of this opportunity and expand.Going AheadRockwell Collins has agreed to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) for $30 billion.The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers and comes as good news for the latter’s shareholders, who are set to enjoy more than 7% premium in terms of share price.Price MovementShares of Rockwell Collins have outperformed the industry in the last six months.

1832,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $279-million modification contract for Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles under the foreign military sales (FMS) program. Per the deal, the company will enhance the PAC-3 missiles production contract to include cost reduction initiative (CRI) missiles and associated ground support equipment. The deal will cater to Saudi Arabia.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL and Huntsville, AL.Lockheed Martin will utilize other procurement (Army) funds in fiscal 2018 to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2023.A Brief Note on PAC-3 Missile SystemThe PAC-3 is a long-range, air-defense and medium- to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.The PAC-3 Missile is a high-velocity interceptor that defeats incoming targets by a direct, body-to-body impact. PAC-3 Missiles, when deployed in a Patriot battery, significantly increase the Patriot system’s firepower, since 16 PAC-3s load-out on a Patriot launcher compared with four Patriot PAC-2 missiles. The company anticipates demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.What’s Favoring Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin’s PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones in the fourth quarter of 2017. It was successful in neutralizing four tactical ballistic missile targets in a complex test in New Mexico that eventually led to the initiation of full-rate production for PAC-3 MSE interceptors.Being Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin has been acquiring contracts from the Department of Defense, as well as from its international clients, for its PAC-3 missiles. In February 2018, the company won a $524 million contract for the production of PAC-3 enhancement missiles and it also clinched a $945 million deal for the same at the end of 2017.Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control segment, which is the primary contractor for the PAC-3 defense missiles and interceptors, recorded fourth-quarter 2017 net sales of $2.3 billion, reflecting a solid 31% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We believe that such inflow of orders for its PAC-3 missiles will enable Lockheed Martin to garner similar top-line growth in the quarter ahead.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed a fiscal 2019 defense budget that provides for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, being a premier missile developer, is expected to gain significantly from this provision.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has improved 24% in the last year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1833,LMT,"This week I discuss Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) both of which have recently received positive long term growth catalyst news.  While each has done well as of late, these new drivers are expected to influence both top and bottom line expectations for the next several years. A recent Morgan Stanley note stated that Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is on the way to becoming a $1 trillion market cap company.  The biggest reason for this lofty expectation is how well the company is positioned to take advantage of the cloud. The combination of Microsoft’s current distribution channels, customer base and core infrastructure services are the keystones for its long term growth in cloud services.  Further, public cloud adaptation is expected to more than double, from 21% to 44%, over the next three years.  The public cloud market is also expected to double in size to over $250 billion. Both Azure and O365 will be the backbones for this cloud adaptation, and long term growth.  Azure is a set of cloud services that IT and developers use to build and manage applications through Microsoft’s datacenters.  O365 (Office 365) is a subscription plan to access Office applications and other productivity services utilized in cloud services.  Each product is helping users transition personal and business tools to the cloud. While this overall transition to the cloud will help the top and bottom lines, it is also expected to improve overall margins as well. The company is also focused on cost management, and the shift to the cloud is anticipated to lower operating expenses in both the near and long term.There is another growth driver that some have kind of forgot about, and that is the acquisition of LinkedIn.  Management recently commented that this segment has been performing better than previously expected as it is now growing much faster than before.  As LinkedIn becomes more integrated into the Microsoft, it is expected to push overall top line growth above 10% (when combined with Azure/O365). All of this positive news has caused both earnings and revenue estimates to move upwards.  Below are the Sales, and Earnings estimates, for the next two quarters, and two years.As you can see in the tables the company is expected to see double digit earnings and revenue growth in 2018.  At the same time MSFT pays a solid +1.88% annual dividend.  So as the company is growing they also pay a solid dividend too.Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) also received some very positive news as of late.  The biggest news item was the passage of the $1.3 trillion spending bill.  Of this $1.3 trillion, about $700 billion is going towards the defense budget.  Also, the President recently appointed John Bolton as National Security Advisor.  Mr. Bolton is considered hawkish on both defense and defense spending.  This is great news for defense contractors. Also, in the month of March (much before the spending bill was passed) LMT won just under $7 billion in defense contracts.  Several of these contracts extend through 2020, providing a steady stream of revenues over the time period. The combination of the defense spending, the appointment of Mr. Bolton, and its ability to consistently win defense contracts has caused the stock price to perform well as of late. As you can see in the Price and Earnings consensus graph below, LMT has been a strong performer for the past several years. The company has also seen consistent increases in annual earnings estimates since 2014.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and Consensus Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and Consensus | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteOutside of the upside for LMT over the next two years, the company also pays an annual dividend yield of +2.44%. Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1834,LMT,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently won a delivery order for H-60 spare parts. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 31, 2020.Valued at $84.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. Raytheon will execute the task for this deal at Texas. Fiscal 2018 through 2020 Navy working capital funds will be used to finance the contract.A Brief Note on H-60H-60 is a family of military helicopters, built by Sikorsky — a unit of defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report). Popularly known as Black Hawk, this series of aircraft serve the U.S. military as well as the armed forces of 28 other countries worldwide as a tough, reliable utility helicopter.Over the last 40 years, this aircraft has served in countless combat zones to deliver and extract troops, saved lives as a MEDEVAC or casualty evacuation platform, provided critical supplies to troops, delivered emergency supplies during natural disasters, and performed as an aerial firefighter and border patroller.More than 4,000 Black Hawk aircraft of all types are in service worldwide today. The U.S. Army is the largest operator with 2,135 H-60 designated aircraft.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability in the past decade, a rapid rise in defense spending has been witnessed among countries worldwide to further strengthen their national security. America is also observing a solid inflow of military contracts lately.With Raytheon being one of the top-notch defense majors in the United States, the company has been winning significant awards from the domestic as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenal portfolio. For instance, the company won a $2.3-billionhybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) weapon systems program, at the end of January 2018. Last week, Raytheon won a modification deal worth $523 million for production of Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile’s (AMRAAM) 31st Lot.Meanwhile the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal aims at spending $12.9 billion for enhancements to U.S. missile defense capabilities. Notably, the budget includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 240 Patriot Missile Segment Enhancements. This in turn surely reflects increased growth prospects for Raytheon and we may expect the company to win more such contracts, like the latest one, from the Pentagon in the coming days.Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 44.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.5%. The company’s growing demand for missile defense systems and expanding overseas business most probably have boosted this outperformance.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) , each of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1835,LMT,"Tensions between Washington and Beijing are easing, with signs of negotiations between China and the United States relating to trade. The nations are looking to come to an agreement to prevent long lasting damage to the global economy.President Donald Trump’s proposal to impose tariffs on around $60 billion worth of Chinese imports of IT, telecom and consumer products did not go down well with traders. China retaliated with prospective tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. imports. As a result, global stock markets declined sharply last week, owing to fears of an all-out trade war hampering market recovery (read: Trump Tariffs: ETF Winners & Losers).However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox news that he is hopeful of the United States reaching a deal with China to work on the huge trade deficit. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.8% in a broad-based rally to close at 24,203. Moreover, Standard & Poor's 500 increased 2.7% and the technology heavy Nasdaq gained 3.3%.What the Markets Think?Following the latest developments in the space, investors are now betting on the proposed tariffs as mere negotiation tactics. A war can never be won, because of the everlasting damage it does to both parties. Wall Street thinks denying cheaper goods to consumers will do more harm than good and that free trade will be better for all (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Trump's Tariff Exemptions).""There's too much at stake,"" per a USA Today article citing Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. ""Policy markers understand that the best and fastest way to harm their constituents is to start a trade war and deny voters low-cost goods produced from around the world while tanking global financial markets,"" Quinlan added.“This declaration of tariffs on the president’s part was his typical opening salvo into a negotiation process,” per a TIME article citing Randy Frederick of Charles Schwab. “He’s done these things in the past, and now it looks like the markets are telling us, ‘Yep, that’s what’s happening,'” he added.The numbers also support this move as being a mere negotiation tactic. The United States imported $506 billion worth of goods from China in 2017 and Trump proposed tariffs on merely $60 billion worth of goods. Per a Capital Economics analysis, even if the tariffs are imposed, targeting $60 billion worth of imports will have a negligible impact on the Chinese economy as it contributed to merely 0.25% of China’s GDP in 2017.Let us now discuss a few ETFs likely to benefit from reduced tensions between the two countries.Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -  Free Report)The tech sector is heavily dependent on China in terms of their revenue percentage. For instance, per an ejinsight article, Apple earned around 20% of its total revenue from China in the last fiscal quarter. XLK is a relatively cheaper bet on the technology sector. This fund has AUM of $20.2 billion and charges a fee of 13 basis points a year. Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) are the top three holdings of the fund, with 14.1%, 11.3% and 6.5% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 28.1% in a year and 4.7% year to date.iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report)Per Office of the United States Trade Representative, the aerospace sector exported $15 billion worth of goods to China in 2016. This fund seeks to provide exposure to the Aerospace and Defense industry. It has AUM of $5.8 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), United Technologies Corp (UTX  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT  -  Free Report) are the top three holdings of the fund, with 10.4%, 7.5% and 7.4% allocation, respectively. ITA has returned 37.1% in a year and 6.5% year to date.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report)Per Office of the United States Trade Representative, the auto sector exported $11 billion worth of goods to China in 2016. This fund focuses on providing exposure to the global automotive sector. It has AUM of $20.0 million and charges a fee of 70 basis points a year. Daimler AG, Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. are the top three holdings of the fund, with 8.0%, 7.8% and 7.7% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 14.6% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1836,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Missiles and Fire Control (“MFC”), recently secured a modification contract for manufacturing additional missile round pallets, spare parts and support equipments for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (“THAAD”) system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by April 30, 2021.Details of the DealValued at $53.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. Operations related to the contract will be carried out in Dallas and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Huntsville, AL; and Sunnyvale, CA.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 procurement funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on THAADTHAAD system is an anti-missile system that uses a hit-to-kill approach to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. It is the only missile defense system with the operational flexibility to intercept both within and outside the Earth’s atmospheres for providing versatile capability to the war fighter.Impressively, the system has a track record of 100% mission success in flight testing since 2005.Our ViewBeing Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Department of Defense each year and 2018 has been no exception. A week back, the company won a $522-million contract for producing Trident II (D5) missiles. In the previous month, Lockheed Martin secured a $524-million PAC-3 Missiles deal. Toward the end of January 2018, it clinched $459-million deal for the production and delivery of interceptors for the THAAD weapon system.Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment, which recorded sales of $2.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, reflected a year-over-year improvement of 31%. The aforementioned contract wins, along with the latest one, will significantly boost this segment’s growth and we may expect its first-quarter 2018 results to reflect similar top-line improvement.  Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, is expected to gain significantly from this provision, which it includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 82 THAAD missiles and $1.7 billion for the procurement of 43 AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense systems.Further, global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Such projections reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the coming days.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 28.7% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1837,LMT,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently won a hybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) weapon systems program.Details of the DealThe contract is valued at $2.3 billion and has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, New Jersey.Apart from engineering services, Raytheon will offer services for ongoing support of software and to refresh for obsolescence to include support of systems outside the continental United States and partner country systems.Work is scheduled to be completed by Jan 31, 2023. Also, per the contract, work locations and funding will be determined with each received order.A Brief Note on PATRIOTPATRIOT is a long-range, high-altitude all-weather missile defense system designed to counter threats from tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced fighter aircraft. This missile defense system was successfully used during the 1991 Gulf and Iraq War.The system consists of radars, command-and-control technology and other multiple interceptors. It is designed and engineered to detect and identify tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aircraft and other threats.Raytheon also designs the popular PATRIOT missile defense interceptors and has been consistently focusing on upgrading this missile defense system in order to keep pace with the changing dynamics of modern warfare.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Raytheon’s PATRIOT missile defense systems have seen a number of buyers in recent times including international customers like Qatar, Korea, Poland and others. In November 2017, Sweden announced theselection of Raytheon’s combat proven Patriot Air and missile defense system capability and is expected to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) in mid-2018, which is approximately worth $1 billion. During the sametime frame, Romania also signed an LOA with the U.S. government to purchase PATRIOT. Such events have thus led the U.S. government to begin contract negotiations with Raytheon and subsequently help thelatter expand in Europe and strengthen its PATRIOT franchise.The strong demand for the system from existing customers also favors the company in a massive way. Armed forces of 14 countries already use this missile defense system and it also plans on expanding its market base in Japan and the Middle-East region. In early January, Raytheon clinched a new direct commercial contract for PATRIOT capabilities worth more than $1.5 billion.No doubt such a solid order flow for the system is capable of substantially stoking Raytheon’s top line. The company’s Integrated Defense Systems (“IDS”) division, which includes the PATRIOT program, recorded fourth-quarter 2017 net sales of $1,553 million, reflecting a 6% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We expect the latest contract to boost growth at this segment in the days ahead.Moreover, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.53 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% (per Markets and Markets research firm). Given the solid prospects, frequent contract wins from the Pentagon for high-end missile systems like the PATRIOT will help Raytheon gain traction in the aerospace and defense industry.Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 44.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 42.5%. The company’s growing demand for missile defense systems and expanding overseas business boosted the performance. Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks    Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1839,LMT,"Defense major Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract, under which it will upgrade four P-3B aircraft, to support the government of Greece.

Notably, the mid-life upgrade will extend the service life of each aircraft by 15,000 flight hours.Majority of the work for this contract will be executed in Marietta, GA and Schimatari, Greece. Foreign military sales (FMS) funds will be used to partly finance the deal.A Brief-Note on P-3BManufactured by Lockheed Martin, P-3B Orion is a four-engine airliner-sized turboprop-powered aircraft. It is used for anti-submarine and maritime surveillance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in major defense programs of the nation like F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter; C-130 Hercules; F-16 Fighting Falcon; F-22 Raptor; and C-5M Super Galaxy. Notably this segment is a primary growth driver for Lockheed Martin.Moreover, FMS has been a strong forte for its growth trajectory, with the company witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East regions. In line with this, in October, Lockheed Martin signed a deal worth $3.8 billion, with the Bahrain Defense force, under which the latter will buy 16 upgraded F-16 aircraft. Surely, the deal will boost Lockheed Martin’s sales at the Aeronautics business division. Notably, this segment recorded 14% sales growth in the third quarter. It goes without saying that such consistent inflow of contracts both domestic as well as overseas like the latest one for P-3B upgrades will provide further impetus to this division’s sales growth in the coming quarters. This in turn will allow the company to retain its position as the largest defense contractor of Pentagon.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 24.6% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 36.9% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, Lockheed Martin's performance lagged the likes of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Co.

1842,LMT,"President Trump recently addressed the Congress in his first State of the Union speech. He emphasized on the achievements made during the first year in office as well as spoke about future priorities. While his business tax cuts boosted small business confidence, regulatory changes worked wonders for banks.He also said that it’s time to address the nation’s “crumbling infrastructure” and urged the Congress to increase defense spending to build up nuclear arsenal. Hence, it seems sensible to invest in these areas that can make the most of Trump’s presidency.Small Business Confidence at All-Time HighTrump has promised a “new American moment” in the address. The President claimed that his business-friendly policies helped the economy grow at a steady clip amid geopolitical concerns and raging scandal over Russia’s meddling with US presidential election. He added that “there has never been a better time to start living the American dream” and called for harmony between Republicans and Democrats.Trump said that the individual tax cuts will provide relief to the middle class, while slashing business tax rate will eventually make American companies more competitive. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019. Small business houses are already benefitting from the tax cut optimism, with small business confidence currently at an all-time high.As per the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the Small Business Optimism Index’s average monthly level came in at 104.8 last year, the highest in the history of the survey. Juanita Duggan, the president and CEO of the NFIB, did claim that increased optimism on massive tax cuts helped small business confidence hit a record high.More or less three in four Americans approved Trump’s State of the Union address, according to the CBS news poll. At the same time, investors kept an eye on the President’s remarks on financial deregulation, and defense and infrastructure spending.Banks to Gain From Deregulation & Tax CutsIn his State of the Union address, Trump boasted his administration’s approach toward deregulation as one of his major achievements. The President said that “in our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country.”Much of the recent rally in banks stemmed from hopes for government deregulation of the industry. After all, banks have outperformed the broader market since Trump’s election, with Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) almost doubling in that time. Thanks to his deregulation speech, such gains are likely to be maintained in the near future.Deregulation will free up banks by giving more power to banking authorities and spurring lending activities. Lest we forget, corporate tax cuts will increase bank’s profitability as they face high tax burden. As per KBW estimates, banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to nearly 20%.Trump Urges Congress to Boost Defense SpendingTrump has called on Congress to put an end to caps on defense spending so that the United States can modernize its nuclear arsenal. He said that better nuclear weapons are required to counter rogue organizations, terror outfits and countries such as China and Russia. His administration, in the meantime, is coming up with a new strategy to improve the country’s missiles, nuclear bombers and submarines.Modernization of nuclear arsenal will result in a cost of more than $1 trillion over the next 30 years, something that bodes well for aerospace and defense stocks. Trump has pledged to seek a $54-billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems.Trump Calls for Higher Infrastructure OutlaysTrump has also urged for huge infrastructure spending. He wants to rebuild disintegrating infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and railways. This is something that he has been promising since his campaign days.He wants the Congress to pass a legislation to stimulate a minimum of $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure outlays. He wants the approval process to reduce to two years if not one. Researchers in McKinsey & Company have figured out that such an amount will indeed be needed to fix the country’s infrastructure needs. The American Society of Civil Engineers, however, raises the amount to $2 trillion. Nevertheless, Trump’s infrastructure plan will certainly boost the nation’s builders.Top 5 GainersTrump’s State of the Union speech focused on rebuilding infrastructure, increasing defense outlays, deregulating banking norms and raising small business confidence by implementing tax cuts. Given the positives, doubling down on the hottest stocks from such areas seems judicious. We have, thus, chosen five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Bill Barrett Corporation  is an independent energy company that acquires, explores and develops oil and natural gas resources in the United States.

1843,LMT,"Defense major Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract, under which it will upgrade four P-3B aircraft, to support the government of Greece. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by December 2023.Details of the DealValued at $260 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will offer structural mid-life upgrades, tailored-phased depot maintenance, a country-specific designed mission integration and management system as well as new avionics for the aircraft. Notably, the mid-life upgrade will extend the service life of each aircraft by 15,000 flight hours.Majority of the work for this contract will be executed in Marietta, GA and Schimatari, Greece. Foreign military sales (FMS) funds will be used to partly finance the deal.A Brief-Note on P-3BManufactured by Lockheed Martin, P-3B Orion is a four-engine airliner-sized turboprop-powered aircraft. It is used for anti-submarine and maritime surveillance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in major defense programs of the nation like F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter; C-130 Hercules; F-16 Fighting Falcon; F-22 Raptor; and C-5M Super Galaxy. Notably this segment is a primary growth driver for Lockheed Martin.Moreover, FMS has been a strong forte for its growth trajectory, with the company witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East regions. In line with this, in October, Lockheed Martin signed a deal worth $3.8 billion, with the Bahrain Defense force, under which the latter will buy 16 upgraded F-16 aircraft. Surely, the deal will boost Lockheed Martin’s sales at the Aeronautics business division. Notably, this segment recorded 14% sales growth in the third quarter. It goes without saying that such consistent inflow of contracts both domestic as well as overseas like the latest one for P-3B upgrades will provide further impetus to this division’s sales growth in the coming quarters. This in turn will allow the company to retain its position as the largest defense contractor of Pentagon.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 24.6% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 36.9% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, Lockheed Martin's performance lagged the likes of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) that have outperformed the industry.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1845,LMT,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business unit, Missile Systems, recently secured a modification contract worth $302.4 million under the Foreign Military Sales program. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by June 2022.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the agreement, Raytheon will procure 618 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-ground missiles (AGM-154 Block III C), containers, component parts/support equipment (spares) and engineering technical assistance. These weapons and associated support will be provided to the government of Saudi Arabia.Majority of the work will be executed in Tucson, AZ; Glascoed, Wales, U.K. and Dallas, TX; while the rest will be carried out in Glasgow, Scotland, UK and various other U.S. locations. FMS funds will be utilized to partly fund the order.A Brief Note on AGM-154The JSOW AGM-154 is a family of low-cost, air-to-ground glide missiles (AGM) manufactured by Raytheon. These missiles employ an integrated GPS-inertial navigation system and thermal imaging infrared seeker.The JSOW-C-1 — a variant of this missile — also known as a JSOW Block III, provides upgraded capability to strike moving land and maritime targets. A modification to the existing JSOW C weapon, this variant adds a weapon datalink radio and modified seeker software to increase capability for the anti-surface warfare mission.Our ViewWith the recent rise in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, demand for advanced weaponries across the globe has increased over the last few years. As a result, with the United States being the largest supplier of arms and ammunitions, major defense contractors of this nation has been witnessing a scrumptious inflow of orders from domestic as well as international customers.   Of late, the frequent counter-missile testing between the United States and North Korea has provided impetus to the country to ramp up their defense inventories. Needless to say, this has benefitted the country’s major missile-makers as well as those offering modification services associated with these missiles like Raytheon, Orbital ATK, Inc. , Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Coming to Raytheon’s performance specifically, its Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenals. To this end, in October, the company won a $300-million worth contract for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles. Based on the 10% sales growth that this unit witnessed in the third quarter of 2017 and the continuous flow of contracts it’s being winning including the latest one, we may expect to see similar performance in days ahead.Moreover, per Markets and Markets research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022. This further reflects substantial growth prospects for renowned missile-maker like Raytheon.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 31.3% over a year, outperforming the 25.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven by rising demand of the company’s missile systems from the Gulf countries and Asia-Pacific, apart from domestic customers. Zacks Rank Raytheon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1846,LMT,"With 26% of the S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 26, we are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season. So far, the results reflect a positive trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations.

1848,LMT,"This week, we are locked and loaded for market-moving news items, from Q4 earnings reports ahead of the bell this morning to the BLS non-farm payroll and unemployment report on Friday, with so much more in between. Some of the biggest names on the Dow and Nasdaq —including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) — will be making their quarterly contributions to this earnings season. For a detailed analysis on what to expect from these major companies, click here.Keurig Buys Dr PepperWe also see a big development in M&A activity early this morning, with privately-owned Keurig Green Mountain announcing its purchase of beverage conglomerate Dr. Pepper Snapple  for $103.75 per share to DPS shareholders. The new company will be called Keurig Dr Pepper with a new ticker symbol — KDP — which will not only seek to increase competition versus bigger beverage giants like Coke and Pepsi, but will be a way for market participants to once again own share of the coffee maker. Shares were up 37% on the announcement.Person Income & SpendingAlso ahead of today’s market open, fresh reads on Personal Income and Spending were released. Income of +0.4% is a tick higher than estimates, while the in-line Spending headline number also reached +0.4%. The revised Spending tally from the previous report, already strong at +0.6%, was revised even higher to 0.8%.“Real” spending hit +0.3% for the month and the deflator reached +0.1%, both slightly down from the previous read. Personal Consumption Core was in-line at +0.2%, a tick higher than last month, and year-over-year this reached +1.5%, in-line sequentially.We also notice the savings rate has fallen to 2.4%, the lowest we’ve seen since 2005. This effectively demonstrated savings are being driven down for many people, as consumer confidence is much higher even if wage growth hasn’t quite kept pace.

1850,LMT,"The latest visit of Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman to the White House proved to be beneficial for the U.S. defense stocks. President Trump was all praise for the prince and mentioned that Saudi Arabia has evolved as a ‘big purchaser’ of American weaponries. Trump mentioned that the kingdom purchased planes, missiles and frigates from U.S. companies worth $12.5 billion, per the deal signed in October 2017 (per Bloomberg).In response to Trump’s plaudits, Salman stated that he is keen to take the “really deep” relationship with the United States forward and is considering to invest $400 billion in the United States over the long run. Notably, the State Department’s latest announcement of Trump administration’s likely approval of $1-billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia is likely to strengthen ties between the nations.Details of the DealThe White House informed the Congress on Mar 22 that it plans to approve a $1-billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, a package that includes about 6,700 U.S.-built anti-tank missiles.The sale also includes providing support, maintenance and spare parts for American tanks, helicopters and other equipment already in Saudi Arabia's arsenal. This deal includes the possible sale of 6,600 TOW anti-tank missiles and an additional 96 jets for training for $670 million. Per the deal, helicopter maintenance services and spare parts for military vehicles will also be provided.The State Department also announced that it is planning to approve the possible sale of Abrams tanks and armored vehicles worth $300 million to Saudi Arabia.Per Reuters, the Department also gave the green light to the proposed sale of equipment and services for military helicopters to Saudi Arabia for $106.8 million.Why Saudi Arabia?Saudi Arabia is an oil rich region and is America's one of the most important partners in the Middle East. The year 2017 saw the two nations signing an arms deal worth $110 billion, which held a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years.  In the past nine months alone, the United States has garnered $54-billion through foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia (according to CNBC).Trump’s latest move to woo the Saudi prince and in turn coax him to invest more in the nation, particularly in defense space, seems to be a strategic one — not only economically but also politically. While Trump believes that higher investments from Saudi Arabia will create jobs for 40,000 Americans, it seems like strengthening relationship with Saudis will help America to counter Iran’s influence in the Middle East, including the Islamic Republic’s alliance with Russia.Defense Stocks to Remain on Growth TrajectoryThe top-notch defense majors in the United States like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) are already gaining significantly, courtesy of the last year’s deal.  With the latest $1-billion deal, that the State Department is determined to approve, and more such others expected to follow through, we may expect the U.S. aerospace and defense stocks to gain substantial traction in the coming days.While Raytheon, manufacturer of the TOW missiles will definitely gain the most from this deal, defense primes, who already enjoy a good rapport with the Saudis, will be the biggest beneficiaries. Moreover, since these stocks also boast strong financials they are worth keeping in your watch list.Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. Of the latest contracts that the company won in relation to Saudi Arabia, worth mentioning are the $945-million deal for exercising production option for fiscal 2018 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles in December 2017 and another $524-million contract for PAC-3 missiles in February 2018.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.62%.

1852,LMT,"Following President Trump’s decision to dismiss U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from office, major defense stocks in the United States moved north in the pre-market trading session on Mar 13. Trump has proposed Mike Pompeo, CIA chief, to replace him. Pompeo is a hard-line conservative.Wall Street took a hit yesterday following a technology sell-off that sent the Nasdaq indexes to their steepest losses in six weeks. A data breach report at Facebook took a toll on the U.S. stock market and, in turn, weighed on the defense industry, outweighing the surge it gained due to Tillerson’s exit news.Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the red over the past five trading sessions. Evidently, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index fell 1.4% over the same time frame, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index suffered a drop of 1.5%. Nevertheless, in keeping with its usual trend, the U.S. defense industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon over the trailing five sessions.Among the highlights of the last week, defense majors Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) secured a number of orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Meanwhile General Dynamics progressed with the CSRA acquisition.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Lockheed Martin recently clinched a contract worth $3.5 billion for providing Army training aids, devices, simulators and simulations, maintenance, sustainment, operations and support to instrumentation systems and live-fire ranges. Work related to the deal is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2020.The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Orlando, FL.

Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by December 2018.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the modification, the long lead material and parts will be acquired for 145 of the 13th Lot of F-35 jet for the Services, non-U.S. DoD participants and foreign military sales (FMS) customers, and for 69 of the 14th Lot of the aircraft for the non-U.S. DoD participants and FMS customers.Majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth, TX; El Segundo, CA; Warton, United Kingdom and Orlando, FL (read more: Lockheed Martin Secures $1.5B Deal for F-35's Spare Parts).2. The subsidiary of United Launch Alliance (“ULA”), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, secured a contract worth $354.8 million for its satellite launch services.

The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Per the terms, the deal will offer long lead time material for steam and electric plant components; the main propulsion unit efforts and ship service turbine generator efforts; and miscellaneous hull, mechanical and electrical system components (read more: General Dynamics Wins $696M Deal for Nuclear Submarines).Meanwhile, General Dynamics recently entered into a bidding war with CACI International for acquiring IT service provider CSRA Inc. . While General Dynamics offered last month $9.6 billion, including a $2.8 billion of debt, for the CSRA buyout, CACI proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover.In spite of the unsolicited offer that CACI made to acquire CSRA, General Dynamics remains confident of the deal and plans to proceed with its tender offer to acquire CSRA’s all outstanding shares. Notably, the tender offer for CSRA shares has commenced on Mar 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on Apr 2.With General Dynamics having secured the necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction, the chance of CACI snatching the deal from this shipbuilder is highly unlikely (read more: Can General Dynamics Beat CACI to Acquire CSRA for $9.6B? ) .4.

1853,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has boosted its quarterly dividend by 20.4%. Also, it has authorized a new stock repurchase plan of $18 billion, which replaces the existing share buyback program. These initiatives are likely to allow investors share the benefits of soaring airliner deliveries.Dividend HikeBoeing will now pay a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share, up from $1.42 paid earlier, bringing the annualized dividend to $6.84. The company will pay the revised dividend on Mar 2, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Feb 9.Notably, Boeing has increased its dividend per share by more than 250% over last five years. Also, the company has been consistently paying dividends to shareholders each quarter for over 75 years.In fact, this aerospace behemoth began offering dividend hikes from 2011. Boeing’s stable returns during the economic downturn also impressed investors. Last year, the company increased its dividend by 30% after witnessing a nominal increase in the range of 15-20% in the last couple of years. Again, in 2013, the company had gifted investors with a massive 50% hike. It is thus clear that the aerospace major is not exactly new to unusually high dividend hikes.Going forward, an accelerated rate of delivery is expected to enable Boeing to deploy the cash proceeds and continue raising its quarterly payout.Share Repurchase ProgramBoeing has declared the completion of its share buyback program for 2017. Meanwhile, the company has spent $9.2 billion out of the original $14 billion authorization announced last December. Markedly, the new approval takes the total authorization to $18 billion.Boeing’s management is yet to decide the timing and volume of repurchases. Under the new share repurchase authorization, buybacks will take place over the next 24-30 months.Our ViewAs the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing holds a respectable position in the United States as well as the global aerospace and defense market. Not only did the company beat third-quarter earnings comfortably but it also raised the guidance for 2017, underscoring its strong cash flow position.The raised dividend and the new buyback authorization indicate Boeing’s optimism on its large and diverse order backlog, which is expected to continue enjoying a conducive environment ahead. Amid budget volatility, uncertainties related to high-cost programs, risks associated with key project executions and order cancellations such moves are sure to win investor confidence.The U.S. aerospace behemoth’s total deliveries during the first nine months of 2017 surpassed its archrival, Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) figures.Moreover, Boeing currently has a backlog of over 5,679 commercial jets as airlines plan to replace their entire fleets in upcoming years. This has urged the company to increase its rate of production to meet demand and ensure a steady source of income.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 80.1% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 40.7%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.The stock also performed better than General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), which missed the industry mark.Zacks RankBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1854,LMT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) Electric Boat division recently secured a $45.9-million contract for the New England Maintenance Manpower Initiative. Per the terms of the deal, the company will carry out non-nuclear maintenance of submarines based at Naval Submarine Support Facility in New London, CT. The deal has been awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Details of the Deal    Per the contract, Electric Boat will provide non-nuclear repair services to support submarine overhauls, maintenance, repair, modernization upgrades, ship alterations, temporary modifications and field changes. In addition, it will deliver supplies, ancillary, corrective and preventative maintenance services.Work is scheduled to be over by December 2022 and will be executed in Groton, CT. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partially finance work under the contract. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $240 million, if the options included in it are exercised.Defense ScenarioThe defense industry got a heavy boost from the approval of fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion by the U.S. Senate in September. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The remaining $60 billion proposed for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other terror afflicted region.This raised defense budget is certainly expected to rake in more orders for major defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) that are dealing with different verticals of the U.S. Defense.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. Nations are strategically strengthening their arsenal and naval power through upgrading submarines as widespread geo-political tensions loom large.Notably, the U.S. Navy recently acknowledged nuclear submarines as its top priority. On top of that, a budget of $6 billion has been allotted for boosting Navy shipbuilding, under the recently- passed fiscal 2018 defense bill. This should help General Dynamics clinch more contracts and strengthen its position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 15.7% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts by the prior U.S. government. Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1858,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $945-million modification contract for exercising production option of fiscal 2018 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. The deal includes delivery of 54 U.S. Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles, 24 Qatar MSE missiles, 130 Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) missiles and other associated ground support equipment.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Operations related to the contract will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL; Huntsville, AL; and Huntington Beach, CA.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2010, 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Jan 31, 2021.A Brief Note on PAC-3 MissilesThe Patriot Advanced Capability-Three (PAC-3) missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.Per Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor employs a two-pulse solid rocket motor that boosts altitude and range. The company projects strong demand for this advanced missile system, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.Our ViewWith rising geo-political tension around the globe, nations are strengthening arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade their defense systems. Defense equipments, in particular missile systems, have been witnessing improved traction recently, courtesy of the ongoing conflict between North Korea and the United States. Considering the fact that Lockheed Martin is a renowned missile-maker and Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, the company has been winning major contracts, in recent times.Evidently, in the third quarter, the State Department approved the sale of THAAD anti-missile defense system worth $15 billion, which will allow Saudi Arabia to purchase 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launchers and 360 missiles, as well as fire control stations and radars. The contract is likely to bolster the company’s long-term growth.In the third quarter, the company also won a contract worth $900 million for delivering LRSO cruise missiles, designed to infiltrate and survive integrated air defense systems and prosecute strategic targets.These contract wins came on the back of increasing prospects in the missile market. In line with this, the rocket and missile market is projected to reach $70 billion during 2017-2022 at a CAGR of 4.7%, as per Markets and Markets research firm.Such estimates for missile market may have made induced Lockheed Martin’s management to raise 2017 sales outlook for three business segments, including Missiles and Fire Control, by a collective $550 million. The raised view was supported by higher expected volumes. We believe, rising demand for missiles in the global space along with the procurement of major contracts, like the latest one, will enable the company to successfully achieve its enhanced sales targets, in the upcoming days.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s shares have returned about 28% in a year compared with the broader industry’s rally of 44.2%. The underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Aerospace sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1859,LMT,"The year 2017 has been an overwhelming one for The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), with the aerospace giant winning a series of billion-dollar orders for commercial jets. In addition, being one of the largest defense contractors, with a market cap of more than $175 billion, this market mover has led the S&P 500 index to new highs multiple times in 2017. Evidently, Boeing’s share price has surged 89.7% so far this year, which more than quadrupled the S&P 500’s gain of 20.1%.Compared to its arch-rival Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report) as well as other peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), this was a notable achievement for Boeing, since none of these stocks gained more than 55% year to date. The company also delivered the latest model of renowned 737 fleet — the 737 Max — in May 2017. Ever since, the company has been witnessing solid order growth for this particular model from varied customers.Below we have discussed the factors which have helped Boeing outperform the broader market this year. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Commercial Orders: A Major Growth DriverBoeing is well known for winning notable commercial orders for its renowned aircraft each year. At the Paris Air Show and the Dubai Air Show in 2017 the company won a number of billion-dollar orders. At the Paris Air Show, the company won a $6.2-billion deal for delivering 50 737 Max 10 jets to Lion Air Group, a $2.2-billion deal for delivering up to 40 737 Max to ALAFCO, a $2.5-billion deal for 20 737 airplanes, an $8.1-billion deal for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, a $7.4-billion deal for a number of 737 10s, 737 8s and 787-9 Dreamliners to CDB Aviation among others.Dubai Air Show 2017 also witnessed some landmark deals involving Boeing. The company won a deal worth $15.1 billion for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates airline, a $27-billion deal for delivering 225 737 MAX airplanes to flydubai airlines, a $2.2-billion order for supplying 20 additional 737 MAX 8s to ALAFCO and a $1.9-billion order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters.Needless to Say, such huge flow of commercial orders aided Boeing’s growth. Notably, the company’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Interestingly, majority of the commercial orders Boeing won in 2017 belonged to the 737-fleet.Considering the fact that 737 is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from 92 customers, such huge order growth will aid the 737 model to maintain its leading position in the single-aisle jet market.Solid Demand Aiding Boeing Demand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes is on the rise due to a steady improvement in passenger and freight traffic. Per Boeing's current market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. Boeing also expects the commercial fleet to be fueled by sustained 4.7% annual growth in commercial passenger traffic.Single-aisle jets are expected to be the major demand driver, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years, reflecting 5% increase over last year's projection. Boeing, being a leading company in single-aisle jet production, on virtue of its 737 model expects to raise the 737 production rate from 47 per month in 2017 to 52 per month in 2018. This surely reflects the optimism that Boeing boasts toward increased demand for its 737 fleet of jets.Apart from its strong forte in the United States, the company expects that China will need 7,240 new planes worth $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years. India will need 2,100 new planes worth $290 billion in 20 years, up 13.5% from the year-ago estimate of 1,850 planesIn the Middle East, Boeing expects to witness demand for 3,350 new planes worth $730 billion between 2017 and 2036. Single-aisle jets worth $190 billion are projected to comprise over 50% of the total deliveries in the Middle East. Such expanding market outlook surely indicates increased growth prospects for Boeing.Defense: Another Glowing BusinessBoeing’s defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company’s third-quarter 2017 defense deliveries were 44 units. Total deliveries consisted of 18 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 11 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed), six F/A-18s, five P-8 models and four F-15s.Boeing remains on track with the $52 billion KC-46 aerial tanker program. Boeing is scheduled to complete delivery of all 179 aircraft by 2027. Apart from the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program, the new organization will also oversee the building of the presidential aircraft for the Air Force along with the CST-100 spacecraft for NASA. Considering the $700-billion fiscal 2018 defense bill sanctioned by the U.S. Senate this September, the defense business of Boeing is expected to gain traction in coming days.New Business VenturesBoeing has lately taken initiatives to expand in an unconventional business line — the “Space.” The company’s management has identified satellite business and space exploration as the two ""key"" opportunities to generate growth. In particular, Boeing has teamed up with NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) to deliver “Deep Space Gateway” and “Deep Space Transport.” While, the Deep Space Gateway is a space outpost, the Deep Space Transport is a vehicle that will take humans to longer-duration space missions. Management expects to construct the gateway in four launches by the early 2020s.Interestingly, fiscal 2018 budget has allocated $3.7 billion for SLS and associated ground system. Once the deep space gateway and transport vehicle concepts are materialized, Boeing, being the prime SLS contractor, will gain the most.Restructurings to Add ValueIn June 2017, Boeing decided to lay off 50 executives from its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment. Simultaneously the company also decided to break down its Military Aircraft and Network & Space Systems segments into four smaller units. At that time Bloomberg announced that 60 defense executives will be transferred to Boeing Global Services. This new unit, incorporating defense and commercial aircraft parts, maintenance, and information technology products, is expected to evolve into a $50-billion business.Constituting more than 21% of the company’s total earnings as of third quarter of 2017, BDS unit holds a significant key to Boeing’s growth story. The company’s management has been focused on reducing cost and inducing enhanced competitiveness and growth in this segment recently. Toward this end, last November, some consolidation initiatives were announced, under which by the end of 2020, its facility spaces were aimed to be reduced by approximately 4.5 million square feet, causing layout of 500 employees.We believe the executive lay-off decision was a bold one taken by Boeing’s management, going a step ahead of what it has done earlier. Such a notable job cut will clearly save money for the company, which, in turn, can be reinvested to boost further growth of its defense unit.Solid Cash Flow Aiding Dividend HikeBoeing has been rewarding shareholders with lucrative dividend hikes. Earlier this month, the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 20.4%, bringing the quarterly payout to $1.71 per share and the annualized payout to $6.84. Along with the dividend hike, Boeing also authorized a new stock-repurchase plan of $18 billion, which replaces the existing share buyback program.Impressively, Boeing has increased its dividend per share by more than 250% over last five years. Also, the company has been consistently paying dividends to shareholders each quarter for over 75 years. A solid cash flow structure primarily supports this dividend payouts for Boeing. Evidently the company boasts solid cash and investments in marketable securities worth $10 billion, as of September 2017. Its cash flow from operating activities at the end of the third quarter of 2017 was $10.4 billion compared with the year-ago quarter figure of $7.7 billion.Should You Invest in BA?We consider that Boeing is a profitable stock which can be a prudent long-term bet for risk averse investors. Year to date, the company’s share price has gained 89.8% compared with Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry’s rally of 44.3%.On the valuation front too, the company looks very attractive. The stock currently has an earnings yield of 3.3%, falling below the S&P 500 average of 4.8%, thereby reflecting scope for improvement. Moreover, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 13% is more than that of industry’s 11.7%.Further, Boeing has a VGM Score of A. Notably, the VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board. This assures our point that the stock has still plenty of potential.To conclude, factors like solid cash flow offering financial stability to Boeing, huge jetliner demand play a vital role for investors to choose this stock as a profitable investment option, which in turn will enable Boeing to maintain its stellar performance and lead the S&P 500 in 2018 as well.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1861,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 31.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by constant contract wins along with higher jet deliveries. Meanwhile a solid cash generating capability also boosts this aerospace giant’s growth.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of big orders for its commercial jets in the fourth quarter including a $27-billion order from flydubai for 225 737 MAX jets and an $11-billion contract from Avolon for 75 737-MAX airplanes. Again, it sealed a deal worth $15.1 billion for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates.Among the defense contracts won in the fourth quarter, the significant ones include a $6-billion deal for procuring 36 F-15QA aircraft for the Qatar Emiri Air Force. Boeing also clinched a contract worth $1.2-billion modification contract for manufacturing and delivering 10 full-rate production P-8A aircraft. The company won a contract worth $240 million for the Royal Saudi Air Force airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $24.83 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.6%.Such improving top line indicates at solid bottom-line growth for the company. In line with this, the consensus estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.91 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.8%.Impressive Q4 Orders & DeliveriesBoeing’s fourth-quarter deliveries showed a 12.8% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. Also, defense shipments improved 7% than the year-ago figure. Higher demand for the 737 and 767 jets primarily drove the year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries. In the last quarter, the company delivered 209 airplanes.In the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 43 in the fourth quarter compared with 40 in the year-ago quarter.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) QuoteDividend Hike: A Strong PositiveBoeing’s strong cash generating capability provides the company with financial flexibility, which in turn allows it to hike dividend significantly and repurchase shares, thereby making the stock a valuable choice for investors. Notably, its cash and investments in marketable securities was $10.03 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the first nine months of 2017, Boeing paid $2.58 billion in dividends and repurchased 39.5 million shares for $7.5 billion.Last month, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 20.4%. Impressively, Boeing has increased its dividend per share by more than 250% over the last five years. Along with the dividend hike, the company authorized a new stock repurchase plan of $18 billion, which replaces the existing share-buyback program.The raised dividend and the new buyback authorization indicate Boeing’s optimism on solid cash inflow that is further supported by its large and diverse order backlog. We expect the company’s yet-to-be reported results to reflect huge backlog for its jets, both defense and commercial.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

1862,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a contract for offering comprehensive F-22 air vehicle sustainment.  Work related to this deal is scheduled to get over by Dec 31, 2027.Details of the DealValued at $7 billion, this contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UH. The deal includes five-year base ordering period. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partially finance the task.Work will be performed at five operational bases and six support locations situated across various parts of the United States as well as overseas locations, combat deployment and enroute support bases, potential locations through depot partnering agreements, and system program office locations.A Brief Note on F-22Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor is the fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft with a unique combination of stealth, speed, agility and situational awareness along with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry.However, high development costs, ban on exports and development of the more versatile F-35 aircraft led to the discontinuation of F-22 production few years back. Nevertheless, the company’s F-22 team remains committed to provide full support for Follow-on Agile Sustainment, a comprehensive weapons management program. This award-winning performance-based logistics contract offers a highly integrated F-22 support system.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Of late, there has been a rapid increase in terrorist activities across the globe. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is leaving no stone unturned to develop  tactical weaponries base.Pentagon being the prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Naturally, the number of contracts it wins from Pentagon is also noteworthy. Moreover, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), among others.In particular, in September 2017, the U.S. Senate approved the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, include funding for various defense programs. This has been a primary factor which is expected to rake in more orders for the defense majors in the long run.During the third-quarter earnings call, Lockheed Martin’s management increased outlook for 2017 profit for Aeronautics, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control by $35 million, reflecting both improved performance and higher volumes. We believe significant contract wins like the latest one will substantially help the company achieve this increased profit target.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 25.4% in last 12 months, underperforming the 42.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This underperformance was mostly led by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1863,LMT,"Monday, January 29, 2018This week, we are locked and loaded for market-moving news items, from Q4 earnings reports ahead of the bell this morning to the BLS non-farm payroll and unemployment report on Friday, with so much more in between. Some of the biggest names on the Dow and Nasdaq —including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) — will be making their quarterly contributions to this earnings season. For a detailed analysis on what to expect from these major companies, click here.Keurig Buys Dr PepperWe also see a big development in M&A activity early this morning, with privately-owned Keurig Green Mountain announcing its purchase of beverage conglomerate Dr. Pepper Snapple  for $103.75 per share to DPS shareholders. The new company will be called Keurig Dr Pepper with a new ticker symbol — KDP — which will not only seek to increase competition versus bigger beverage giants like Coke and Pepsi, but will be a way for market participants to once again own share of the coffee maker. Shares were up 37% on the announcement.Person Income & SpendingAlso ahead of today’s market open, fresh reads on Personal Income and Spending were released. Income of +0.4% is a tick higher than estimates, while the in-line Spending headline number also reached +0.4%. The revised Spending tally from the previous report, already strong at +0.6%, was revised even higher to 0.8%.“Real” spending hit +0.3% for the month and the deflator reached +0.1%, both slightly down from the previous read. Personal Consumption Core was in-line at +0.2%, a tick higher than last month, and year-over-year this reached +1.5%, in-line sequentially.We also notice the savings rate has fallen to 2.4%, the lowest we’ve seen since 2005. This effectively demonstrated savings are being driven down for many people, as consumer confidence is much higher even if wage growth hasn’t quite kept pace. There is nothing untenable in this figure at this stage, especially with the wealth effect from lower taxes expected to have a positive effect for many individuals and almost all corporations.Q4 Earnings This MorningVery quickly, defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) posted $4.30 per share on $15.14 billion in quarterly revenues, both up from Zacks consensus estimates of $4.06 per share and $14.75 billion, respectively. Earnings were +6% year over year and revenues were +10%. Full year 2018 guidance of between $15.20-15.50 per share well outpaces the current Zacks estimate of $13.88 per share.

1865,LMT,"L-3 Technologies, Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Vertex Aerospace business unit has won a modification contract worth $10.25 million for providing logistics support to the T-1A aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.Details of the DealPer the agreement, L-3 Technologies will offer contractor-operated maintained supply services, over and above, on-equipment maintenance along with data and field service representatives.Work is scheduled to be over by Mar 31, 2018, and will be executed at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas; Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas; and Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to finance the task.A Brief Note on T-1A AircraftThe T-1A aircraft is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer aircraft used for advanced pilot training. It is used by the Air Force for flying strategic, tactical airlift and tanker aircraft.Our ViewThe defense industry received a boost when the U.S. Senate approved a fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion in September 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations, like buying weapons and paying for the troops. The remaining $60 billion is proposed for Overseas Contingency Operations and will be utilized to fund military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.This raised budget is expected to help draw orders for major defense contractors like L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report).During the third quarter of 2017, owing to the loss of the re-competition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract, the company decided to sell its Vertex Aerospace unit, anticipating that the carrying amount of the goodwill for this unit may not be recoverable. Thus, the latest contract may not prove profitable for L3 Technologies.Nevertheless, excluding Vertex Aerospace, units of L3 Technologies cater to various defense-related products, which we believe will help the company maintain its leading position in the global security market. In fact, divesting Vertex Aerospace seems to be a prudent move as continuing with a loss-incurring segment offers no benefit to a company’s growth. Instead streamlining its operations toward other realms of the defense space will be more gainful.Such contract wins may or may not benefit the company, as we are not yet aware of what the company’s strategy will be regarding the services it provides through Vertex Aerospace, once it sell out this unit; i.e. whether to keep all the services or a few of them.Price MovementShares of L3 Technologies have rallied 20.5% year to date, lagging the industry’s gain of 28.5%.The underperformance can be attributed to low contract orders from international markets and weak performance in some of the product lines.Zacks RankL3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1866,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Rotary and Mission Systems has won a modification contract to exercise an option period for the procurement of Technical Insertion (TI) 18-20 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) engineering services.Contract DetailsValued at $122.3 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development test and evaluation funds for the Navy to complete the work by December 2018.A Brief Note on A-RCI SystemsA-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. Additionally, it facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions as well as under-ice operations.In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems that allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost. Notably, the TI 18-20 A-RCI engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.Our ViewWith the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy’s focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. In fact, patrolling in these areas has become need of the hour to defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Consequently, timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the A-RCI submarine sonar system all the more critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation’s naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. The segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27.9% of its total revenues.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States.Moreover, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy that authorized the United States’ defense spending worth $700 billion has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Considering the aforementioned developments, the company is expected to win more of such contracts in days ahead, given that most of its programs are the top priorities of Pentagon.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 18.9% in a year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.3%. This could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally. Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1867,LMT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has secured an order from Avolon — the international aircraft leasing company — for 75 of its 737-MAX airplanes. Following the signing of memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show in June, the deal has been finally awarded during the 2017 Dubai Air Show.Order in DetailThe agreement comprises an order for 55 MAX 8 and 20 MAX 10 airplanes — the newest and largest member of the 737 MAX family — including purchase rights for 20 additional MAX 10 jets.Valued at nearly $11 billion at current list prices, the deal represents the largest single order till date that the company has placed with Boeing. Given the size of the deal, Avolon is expected to get a discount on the list price of the aircraft.With this latest aircraft deal, Avolon’s position as a leading lessor in the global commercial aviation market is likely to be strengthened. Currently, this Dublin, Ireland-based company has over 140 MAX aircraft in its owned and committed fleet, and expects MAX family airplanes to continue boosting its customers’ profit in their businesses, going forward.Deals Inked at the Ongoing Dubai Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic.Of late, at the Dubai Air Show, this aircraft giant received an order from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 additional 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion. Additionally, the company secured an order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters, valued at approximately $1.9 billion, from Azerbaijan Airlines.Apart from this, the company sealed a deal for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates,  the largest airline in the Middle East.  The purchase order also comes with equipments related to the 787-10 fleet, valued at $15.1 billion.Given the enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is witnessing significant progress, especially in the single-aisle market.Global Demand for Single-Aisle AircraftBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. The figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind the increase in demand, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges. Recently, Airbus received an order for 430 single-aisle airplanes valued at $49.5 billion at the Dubai Air Show.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Notably, the 737 model is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from 92 customers. The latest order that Boeing won from Avolon will aid the 737 model to maintain its leading position in the single-aisle jet market, going ahead.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has surged 68.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.9%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions.The stock also performed better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), which missed the industry mark.Zacks RankBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1868,LMT,"Defense major Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit secured a modification contract for providing engineering and interim logistics services as well as delivering spares and associated material, related to Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Work related to the deal is expected to be over by November 2020.Details of the DealValued at $92.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, CA.  Majority of the work will be carried out in Scottsdale, AZ.Fiscal 2018 weapons procurement (Navy); fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy); and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized incrementally to finance this deal.A Brief Note on MUOSMUOS is a narrowband military satellite communications system. It not only enables modern net centric communications capabilities but also supports legacy terminals for global customers. It has been developed for the U.S. Navy by Lockheed Martin.MUOS satellites are equipped with a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access payload that provides more than 10 times the communications capacity over the current Ultra High Frequency (UHF) satellite system. Each MUOS satellite includes a legacy UHF payload which is fully compatible with the current UHF Follow-on system and legacy terminals. Once operational, MUOS will provide 16 times the capacity of the legacy system it will eventually replace.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s  Space Systems segment designs and develops satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems like the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Space Based Infrared System, GPS-III, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series and more. Space Systems is responsible for various classified systems and services required for national security.With a rapid increase in militant activism, geo-spatial intelligence is the need of the hour. Lockheed Martin’s extensive systems help the Intelligence Community transform raw imagery and sensor data into layered, detailed maps. This helps troops, intelligence agents and emergency responders to address terrorism.In line with this, Global Military Satellite market, valued at $7.9 billion in 2017, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.50%, to value $10.1 billion by 2027 (per a Reportbuyer report).This indicates the solid growth prospects of this market in days ahead.Notably, geopolitical tension, all over the globe, is on the rise at present and is unlikely to subside any time soon. Thus prominent defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are expected to win more defense deals in relation to satellite communication securities from the government in coming days. A look at the company’s latest quarterly numbers also reflects the same. In particular, Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems segment generated revenues of $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting 18.5% of the total revenue.We expect solid inflow of contracts from Pentagon like the latest one will aid Lockheed Martin in maintaining the trend of putting up a solid performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.5% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 30.6% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, Lockheed Martin's performance lagged the likes of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) that have outperformed the industry.  Zacks Rank & Key PickLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Leidos Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters with a positive average surprise of 14.81%.

1869,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business segment recently secured a modification contract to exerc ise options for Trident II (D5) missile production and for providing associated system support for deployment. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $522.3 million, the contract has been awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, DC.Majority of the work for this agreement will be executed in Magna, Utah and Sunnyvale, CA. The remaining part will be carried out in Cape Canaveral, FL; Pittsfield, MA and in various other regions across the United States.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 weapons procurement (Navy), fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds, and fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds might also be utilized to partially finance the deal, subject to availability.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and BritishVANGUARD-class submarines.Markedly, these missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. Notably, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile is a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.Along with the United States and other powerful nations, developing countries across the globe are also revamping their missile strength due to the increasing geopolitical conflicts, war, and terrorism. As a result of this, the global rocket and missile market, which also includes fleet ballistic missiles, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Such projects reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the years to come.In February 2018, the $716-billion proposal made by President Trump for the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill is surely anticipated to boost the overall defense industry. In particular, this budget provisions for an investment of approximately $6 billion in the United States’ missile defense program. We believe the latest contract won by Lockheed Martin is a reflection of the fact that the United States is rapidly expanding its missile strength and given the budget’s allocation for missile programs, the company will win more such deals in the days ahead.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 23.3% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report). While Boeing and Huntington Ingalls sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Rockwell Collins carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1870,LMT,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

1871,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently clinched a contract for providing Army training aids, devices, simulators and simulations, maintenance, sustainment, operations and support to instrumentation systems and live-fire ranges. Work related to the deal is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2020.Valued at $3.5 billion, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Orlando, FL. Per the terms, work locations and funding to perform the task will be decided with each order.Lockheed’s Training & Simulation SolutionsAs the world’s leading systems integrator, Lockheed Martin delivers comprehensive training and logistics solutions to prepare military personnel for the most complex missions. Its training programs include teaching pilots to fly the world’s most advanced fighter jet, leading a convoy through city streets and preparing medical professionals for providing the best possible patient care, among others.Additionally, to keep the U.S. Army ready for battle, Lockheed Martin provides simulation solutions where training meets reality. In this regard, the company’s Prepar3D is a visual simulation platform that allows users to create training scenarios across aviation, maritime, and ground domains. Users can train anywhere in the virtual world from underwater to sub orbital space.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment provides simulation and training services. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the RMS segment generated net sales of $4.4 billion, representing 28.7% of the company’s total sales and a year-over-year improvement of 14.2%. Now that the company has one the aforementioned multi-billion contract, we may expect this business segment to reflect similar strong performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Meanwhile, last month, President Trump proposed the fiscal 2019 budget that aims at increasing the end strength for the Army, Navy and Air Force by 25,900 compared with the fiscal 2018 budget. Moreover, this is the second full-budget request from the President for initiating the rebuilding process for the U.S. military that Trump has been consistently emphasizing on. The rebuilding process will involve additional investments in near-term readiness, which we believe includes providing vigorous training to the soldiers and offering simulation solutions to make them combat-ready.Being the leading contractor of the Pentagon, Lockheed Martin is likely to be a huge beneficiary of this budget, if approved.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 24.4% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.2%. This underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

1875,LMT,"This year has been a big year for the stock market, with many notable indexes soaring to new highs. But 2017 was important for more than just share price performance—it also marked another year where the number of women leading Fortune 500 companies jumped as well.The percentage of women heading Fortune 500 companies hit an all-time high in 2017. As of this summer, when Fortune released its 2017 Fortune 500 list, 32 of the CEOs were women, up from just 21 last year.That number still only accounts for 6.4% of the total, but it proved to be the highest in the history of the list. The number of female-led companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 index is smaller by comparison, with only 26 women—or 5.2%—holding their company’s top position. This figure is based on a list compiled by the nonprofit group Catalyst. The firm also noted that women hold 21% of S&P 500 board seats.Those numbers indicate that there is still plenty of progress to be made, but female CEOs did lead some of the biggest and most well-known companies, in a range of industries, in 2017.This list includes the likes of aerospace and defense power General Dynamics’ (GD  -  Free Report) Phebe Novakovic, as well as industry competitor Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In the retail sector, Barbara Rentler has helped the discount department store firm Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) stock hit a new all-time high this year, making her one of several women leading their companies to new heights.Let’s take a closer look at more of those leaders:Mary Barra,General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) General Motors’ Chairman and CEO Mary Barra has served as the auto giant’s chief executive since January 2014. Since taking over the role as CEO, Barra has helped push GM towards the future with a focus on connected vehicles and electric car technology. On top of that, Barra began to focus some of GM’s energy on autonomous vehicle technology.Shares of GM are up 21.96% in 2017, and the company rests close to its five-year high, which it reached earlier this year. GM has beat or matched earnings expectations in the trailing 10 quarters and nearly every quarter since Barra became CEO.Tricia Griffith, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) Tricia Griffith took over as president and chief executive officer of the insurance giant in July 2016. Since taking on the leading role at Progressive, Griffith began to bolster the company’s offerings. Previously, the company only really offered automotive coverage, but now Progressive has entered the $300 billion home insurance market—where they offer customers the chance to bundle home and auto.Griffith helped roll out the company’s HomeQuote Explorer tool. “Normally, homeowner quotes are a nightmare,” Griffith told Fortune. “They take a long time. This is something that we will buy, any publicly available data. You fill in a couple of fields and you get a home quote from four companies. Really easy.”Shares of Progressive are up over 57% on the year, and just hit a new 52-week and all-time high of $56.28 per share on Wednesday.Indra Nooyi,Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report)Indra Nooyi became Pepsico’s President and CEO in October 2006. She was then appointed chairman in May 2007. Nooyi facilitated Pepsico’s merger with Quaker Oats, which brought the beverage giant not only Quaker, but sports drink power Gatorade as well. She also helped lead the acquisitions of Tropicana and Wimm-Bill-Dann—which is the largest international acquisition in company’s history.Pepsico stock is up 13.36% this year, and it just recently hit a new all-time high of $119.74 per share, thanks in large part to Nooyi’s improvements to the company’s business.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

(BA  -  Free Report), secured a contract for its satellite launch services. Per the terms, United Launch Services, LLC (“ULS”) — the subsidiary — will deliver AFSPC-8 and AFSPC-12 satellites to their intended orbit.Details of the DealAwarded by the Contracting Division, Launch Systems Enterprise Directorate, Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA and is valued at $354.8 million.Per the modification contract, ULS will carry out launch vehicle production, mission integration, launch operations and spaceflight certification for the AFSPC-8 and AFSPC-12 missions.Operations will be completed by March 2020 to deliver the AFSPC-12 satellites. The AFSPC-8 satellites will be delivered post the completion of operations  in June 2020.Tasks related to the contract will be executed in Centennial, CO; Decatur, AL; and Cape Canaveral, FL. ULS will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 space procurement as well as fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to complete operations.About ULAFormed in 2006, ULA provides the U.S. government with affordable, reliable and assured access to space. It has three launch vehicles — Atlas V, Delta IV and Delta II. ULA's launch vehicles have played a major role in the U.S. space ventures, with high commitment toward crew safety and mission success.Our ViewULS has been serving as the nation’s launch services provider with its Delta IV and Atlas V rockets for more than a decade. The subsidiary incorporates latest technologies to ensure mission success within a reasonable cost. Till date, ULS has successfully launched more than 100 satellites in the orbit, which provide critical information to the military and enable personal device-based GPS navigation.With increasing number of threats in the cyber security space, military satellites like AFSPC-8 and AFSPC-12 have emerged as an integral component for national security. To enhance defense capabilities, the United States has been making major investments, especially during President Trump’s tenure.

The underperformance was caused by intense competition in the domestic and international markets. Meanwhile, Boeing’s shares have gained 84.8%, compared with the broader industry’s rally.

1880,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment recently secured a contract for providing U.S. and U.K. Trident II (D5) Strategic Weapon System Shipboard Integration Increment 8 as well as Columbia and Dreadnought efforts for the navigation subsystem. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $154.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Program, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Mitchel Field, New York and Huntington Beach, CA. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds, U.K. funds as well as fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task.Through this contract, the company will provide the required navigation hardware and software design, testing, installation and deliverables for the shipboard integration increment. It will also deliver correlating fleet support services for the current fleet ballistic missile navigation subsystem.In particular, the contract will provide U.S. and U.K. Inertial Navigation System and gyro modification and repair, Columbia navigation subsystem development and material procurements, modernization efforts for shipboard integration program, including U.S. and U.K. trainer maintenance and development. Also, long lead material procurement for Ohio and Vanguard transducers and long-range software modernization activities along with a portable data collection system will be delivered.Our ViewLockheed Martin's RMS business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. The business supports the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy and Missile Defense Agency of the United States, as well as intelligence, civil, commercial and international military customers.Although, during third quarter 2017, the RMS unit witnessed sales growth of a mere 0.2%, management has raised its 2017 sales outlook for this segment. This indicates growth prospects for the unit in the fourth quarter, in which contracts like the latest one will play a major role.Additionally, per a report by Markets and Markets research firm, the rocket and missile market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.7% during 2017-2022 to $70 billion. This growth can be attributed to the increasing geopolitical conflicts, war and terrorism, which are driving the demand for rockets and missiles globally. Considering the fact that Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, boasting a high demand, we expect Lockheed Martin to win more such contracts associated with it. This, in turn, will enable the company to capture larger shares in the expanding rocket and missile market.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up about 27.4% in a year compared with the broader industry's gain of 43.1%. This underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the Aerospace sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

1881,LMT,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) business division, Defense, Space & Security, recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $6.2 billion. Per the terms of the deal, the company will procure 36 new F-15QA aircraft that will be provided to the Qatar Emiri Air Force.The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH and is scheduled to be over by Dec 30, 2022. FMS funds will be utilized to partially finance the work, which will be executed in St.Louis, MI.    A Brief Note on F-15 Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories. The F-15QA is a variant of F-15 that has been developed for the Qatar Air Force.Our ViewBoeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, with its defense business standing out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog.In particular, among other defense equipment, the company’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. So far, Boeing has manufactured more than 1,600 of the aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire the F-15, thereby indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability. In 2016, the company delivered 15 F-15s, up 25% from the year-ago tally.In October 2015, Boeing was selected by the U.S. Air Force as the prime contractor for its Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System program, which was initially valued at $4 billion. The program was developed to counter threats and protect air crew at an advanced level and aimed at upgrading F-15 aircraft.  Needless to say, this reflects the popularity that this particular jet enjoys in the United States.With rising security threats across the globe, apart from developed nations like the United States, developing economies like India, Qatar and a few more are ramping up their arsenal. Considering this we may expect further expansion of customer base for F-15, beyond its domestic realm, which in turn will boost Boeing’s profit from its defense business.Moreover, the $700-billion worth fiscal 2018 defense policy bill that got sanctioned this September by the U.S. Senate, is expected to boost the business of the major U.S. defense contractors like Boeing, General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBoeing’s stock has moved up 87.4% over a year, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 43.1%. This might have been led by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Zacks Rank Boeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1882,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Missions Systems (RMS), recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for manufacturing DDG AEGIS weapon system J7 baseline. The weapon system will support the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force.Valued at $135.8 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to this is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Majority of the work will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ; while the rest will be carried out at Dahlgren, VA and a few cities of Japan. FMS fund will be used partially to finance the task.A Brief Note on Aegis & J7 BaselineManufactured by Lockheed Martin, Aegis is the world’s most advanced combat system that can simultaneously destroy land targets, submarines, and surface ships along with providing protection against aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The computer-based command and decision element is the core of the AEGIS combat system. The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system is the primary sea-based component of the U.S. missile defense system.The USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53) is a guided missile destroyer battleship, currently in service with the U.S. Navy. It is the third of the 75 planned Arleigh Burke-class of surface ships. While DD represents the basic destroyers per US Navy classifications, G stands for its guided missile armament design. It uses the latest evolution of Lockheed Martin’s Aegis Combat System to detect, track, launch a missile and successfully intercept a Medium Range Ballistic Missile target.In a joint research program conducted by the United States and Japan, Lockheed Martin is developing an Aegis Baseline 9.C2 (BMD 5.1) variant computer program, referred to as J7, for deployment on Japan’s Aegis destroyers.What’s Ahead for Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin's RMS segment carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders.Presently, Lockheed Martin's Aegis system is the maritime weapon system choice for six powerful nations. Moreover, apart from its strong forte across the United States, the company also enjoys a solid position in the defense-field in the overseas as well. Therefore the latest contract will surely expand the company’s international footprint.In August 2016, Lockheed Martin announced plans to expand the global Aegis fleet in the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea, under a $490-million deal to develop integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) capabilities. We believe the latest contract will allow Lockheed Martin’s to achieve this target.Needless to say, such contract wins will keep the company on a solid growth trajectory. Although, during third quarter 2017, the RMS unit delivered sales growth of mere 0.2%, management has enhanced its 2017 sales outlook for this segment. This indicates signs of growth prospects for the unit in the fourth quarter, in which contracts like the latest one will play a solid role.Additionally, the 2018 fiscal defense bill worth $700 billion has further boosted the probability of increased  order inflow from various departments of the U.S. Defense for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 28% in last 12 months, underperforming the 43.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This underperformance was mostly led by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1883,LMT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for providing fiscal 2018 lead yard services and development studies and design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.  Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Groton, CT.Details of the DealValued at $432 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the modification, the lead yard services will maintain, update, and support the Virginia-class design and related drawings and data for Virginia-class submarines. This will include technology insertion, throughout its construction and post shakedown availability period.Moreover, the company will provide engineering and related lead yard services necessary for direct maintenance and support of Virginia-class ship specifications. In addition, this contract will offer development studies and design efforts related to the Virginia-class submarine design and design improvements, preliminary and detail component and system design, integration of system engineering, design engineering, test engineering, logistics engineering and production engineering.Development studies and design efforts will also be supplied in relation to components and systems to accomplish research and development tasks and prototypes and engineering development models required to evaluate new technologies to be inserted in succeeding Virginia-class submarines.Fiscal 2018, 2017, 2012, 2015, 2013, 2014 and 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds,  as well as fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 research, development, test and engineering funds will be utilized to complete the task by December 2018.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued at around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. With widespread geo-political tensions looming over the globe, nations are strengthening up their arsenals and boosting up their naval power through upgrading submarines is one such strategy.In line with this, considering the solid demand for the Virginia-class submarine, the U.S. Navy plans to build an advanced model of this submarine in the subsequent years. This latest model will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  We believe the launch tubes of VPM will have the capability to carry a total of 28 additional Tomahawk cruise missiles.In fact, the Navy earlier proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM. This indicates additional defense contracts for General Dynamics, which, in turn, is expected to boost the company’s growth trajectory.Further, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted for the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor. As a result, we believe that the modification contract will undoubtedly put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Industry ScenarioIn September, the U.S. Senate approved a $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act, which provides necessary funding to the U.S. Military to carry out activities in homeland and overseas. The bill authorizes $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.The defense expenditure for fiscal 2018 is expected to exceed fiscal 2017 levels by nearly $83 billion. The defense spending approved by the Senate is higher than what President Trump had requested for. This has raised the growth prospects of defense primes like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In addition, the bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. This would benefit the nation’s prime shipbuilders like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls.Price Performance General Dynamics’ stock has returned 12% over a year, underperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the prior U.S. government.  Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1884,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.However, a large percentage of Lockheed Martin’s business comes from the U.S. government. Hence, any cutback in the domestic defense budget is a potential risk for its future performance.Estimate Trend & Surprise HistoryInvestors should note that the fourth quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $4.06 per share has remained same over the last 7 days.Coming to the earnings surprise, Lockheed Martin Corporation has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, resulting in a positive average surprise of 4.87%.Zacks Rank: Currently, Lockheed Martin has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) but that could change following its fourth quarter 2017 earnings report which has just released.

1885,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) received a $150-million contract to provide engineering support services for multiple Commercial Derivative Aircraft (CDA) platforms.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Work related to the deal will be majorly carried out in Oklahoma City, OK; San Antonio, TX and other locations across the United States. Work under the contract is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2019.A Brief Note on CDA PlatformA commercial derivative aircraft began operations as a commercial aircraft but was later transformed into military aircraft. The U.S. Military and Defense forces are currently using Boeing’s P-8A and P-8I, both of which were launched as a Next Generation 737-800. Other derivatives like the Airborne Early Warning & Control, Airborne Warning and Control System and KC-46 tanker started operations as 707s, 737s or 767s.Our ViewBoeing’s third-quarter backlog stood at $46 billion, with international customers accounting for 35%. This included 36 F-15 fighter aircraft for Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft for Kuwait, up to 40 Chinook helicopters for Saudi Arabia and the C-17 military transport aircraft for India.This shows the solid demand that Boeing’s products enjoy in the overseas. In particular, products like rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites have been witnessing solid traction in the international market. As developing countries like Japan and India are expanding their defense budget, in line with developed countries, we expect Boeing to win more FMS contracts like the latest one.In line with this, during the fourth quarter, Boeing’s Defense business secured a foreign military sales contract worth $6.2 billion from the Qatar Emiri Air Force. The company also clinched a $279-million deal for delivering the first KC-46 tanker and logistics support to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.During the third-quarter earnings call, Boeing raised its 2017 sales outlook citing higher sales volume as the primary reason. Considering the rise in international demand as indiacted by rising contract wins for its defense offerings, we expect Boeing to see impressive sales growth in the days ahead.The company poses stiff competition to peers like Lockheed Martin Corp.

(GD  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1891,LMT,"The Q3 earnings season has begun on an optimistic note, with 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) reporting encouraging numbers as of Oct 20.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these members rose 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. The earnings beat ratio for these members was 71.3%, while that for top line was 70.1%.Coming to the Aerospace-Defense industry, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) released its quarterly result on Oct 24, wherein the company's earnings were lower than what most analysts had expected. Nevertheless, with several other defense behemoths set to report third-quarter numbers this week and considering the favorable budget trend prevailing in this industry, we may expect the industry’s earnings scenario to improve.Notably, projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at a mixed quarter, when compared to the overall Q3 forecast for the S&P 500 cohort. The Sector’s earnings are likely to decline 12.9% on 5.3% higher revenues; while earnings for S&P 500 members are likely to rise 2.6% on 5% higher revenues, as of Oct 20.Interestingly, defense stocks in the third quarter reached new-all-time highs for multiple times, courtesy of the varied supportive defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. In particular, the favorable budgetary amendments made by the U.S. government, like the passing of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 million, have boosted the growth prospects of defense stocks. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon to ‘rebuild’ the U.S. Army also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are surely to gain traction in the near term.With 180 S&P 500 members lined up for  their quarterly results release this week, let’s take a look at two defense majors — Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) —  both of which are scheduled to release quarterly results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Raytheon’s Missile Systems segment is a major growth driver. The third quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit, on the back of contract wins for its product line. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales is $1,980 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.2%.Apart from its strong forte in the domestic front, international business expansion has also been another significant growth driver for Raytheon. The company is currently witnessing strong demand for varied product line not only from the Middle East but also from Asia Pacific. We believe once the company reports third-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Moreover, during second-quarter earnings call, Raytheon’s management raised its EPS guidance to reflect the company’s improved operating performance alongside expecting the bottom line to grow in the third quarter. In line with this our consensus estimate for Raytheon’s earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, reflecting annual growth of 6.4%.Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Raytheon has the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.05% because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.91, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.90 (read more: Can Missile Systems Unit Drive Raytheon's Q3 Earnings?).Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise  Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company QuoteL3 Technologies expects sales of roughly $2.7 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects about 6% organic growth. While operating margin is anticipated to lie in the mid-9% range, earnings per share is projected to be between $1.85 and $1.95.However, the company expects Aerospace Systems segment to decline in the third quarter compared with the first half of 2017. This is primarily due to certain contract price modifications at Vertex sliding into the fourth quarter of 2016, and sales mix in Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance as well as aircraft systems.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that L3 Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is becausethe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Both of its Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.94 (read more: L3 Technologies Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).L-3 Technologies, Inc.

1892,LMT,"L3 Technologies Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Vertex Aerospace business unit recently clinched a modification contract for providing additional support to the U.S. Navy’s T-45 Goshawk aircraft system. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by September 2018.Details of the DealValued at $37.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division, Orlando, FL. Per the terms of the agreement, Vertex Aerospace will offer additional organizational, intermediate and depot level maintenance, logistics as well as engineering services to support and maintain approximately 200 T-45 Goshawk aircraft and aircraft systems.It will also provide equipments to support flight and test and evaluation operations. Majority of the work will be carried out in Naval Air Station (NAS) Kingsville, TX and NAS Meridian, MS; while the rest will be executed in NAS Pensacola, FL and NAS Patuxent River, MD. Funds will be provided on issuance of individual task orders.A Brief Note on T-45 Goshawk aircraft  T-45 Goshawk — manufactured by Aerospace giant The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) — is a militarized version of the land-based British Aerospace Hawk. Its latest version, the T-45C, with a digital cockpit to train pilots destined for the F/A-18 Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II and other carrier-based aircraft, made its first flight in October 1997. It had two multifunction displays in each cockpit; the displays provided navigation, weapon delivery, aircraft performance and communication data.Although, Boeing delivered the 221st and final T-45 training jet to the Navy in November 2009, it  continued to support the T-45 fleet by providing engineering, logistics and support equipment in partnership with BAE Systems plc (BAESY), which supplied the aircraft’s rear and center fuselage sections, wing assembly and vertical tail.Our ViewL3 Technologies is transforming its business portfolio to focus more on defense electronics, communications and ISR markets where it has leading positions. Toward this end, its Aerospace Systems segment, constituting Vertex Aerospace unit, delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides engineering, modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems.However, during the third quarter, owing to the loss of the recompetition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract, the company decided to sell off its Vertex Aerospace unit, anticipating that the carrying amount of the goodwill for this unit may not be recoverable. So the latest contract may not benefit L3 Technologies.Nevertheless, excluding Vertex Aerospace, units of L3 Technologies caters to various defense-related products, which we believe will help the company to maintain its leading position in the global security market. In fact, divesting Vertex Aerospace seems to be a wise decision as continuing with a loss-incurring segment offers no benefit to a company’s growth. Instead streamlining its operations toward other realms of the defense space will surely be profitable for L3 Technologies. Toward this end, in the third quarter, the company combined its Greenville and Waco operations of Aerospace segment and reduced headcount by over 700 people, to cut cost and add more value to its business.Meanwhile, the defense industry got a heavy boost when the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion this September. This increased budget is expected to rake in more orders for defense majors such as L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Price Performance L3 Technologies stock has returned 21.8% over a year, underperforming the 30.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts implemented by the U.S. government.Zacks RankL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1893,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Aeronautics has won a modification contract to procure 53,164 level-of-effort hours to support air system software integration. The company will also secure 53,122 level-of-effort hours to support flight test operations for the F-35 aircraft platform.Contract DetailsValued at $23 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The services will be used by the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants.Notably, the contract covers 40% of the purchases for the Air Force, 20% for the U.S. Navy, 20% for the Marine Corps and non-U.S. DoD participants each.Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, while the rest will be executed in Palmdale, CA and Patuxent River, MD. The deal is expected to be complete by February 2018.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps) and non-U.S. DoD participant funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner of the F-35 program, it has also been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project, in the recent past.Therefore, Lockheed Martin inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.Over the next few years, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.In fact, we believe that the recent contract win will also enable the company to take a step toward achieving this goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of notable contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, the company secured a modification contract worth $5.6 billion to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35. Again, in August 2017 it won a contract worth $258 million to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Therefore, the government is likely to place larger orders for this program, which in trun will boost the company’s profits, in days ahead.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 16.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.8%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1894,LMT,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense, Space & Security business segment recently secured a modification contract for providing sustainment support to its E-4B military aircraft. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Nov 30, 2018.Details of the DealThe contract, with a ceiling value of $80 million, was awarded by the Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, OK. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer program management, field service representative, system integration laboratory, spare procurement, repair/overhaul, emergency support and engine overhaul. The related work will be carried out in Oklahoma City, OK and Offutt Air Force Base, NE. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to partially finance the deal.A Brief Note on E-4BThe E-4B, a militarized version of the Boeing 747-200, is a four-engine, swept-wing, long-range high-altitude airplane capable of refueling in flight. An E-4B can provide seating for up to 112 people, including a joint-service operations team, Air Force flight crew, maintenance and security component, communications team and selected augmentees.These aircraft are equipped with 13 external communications systems and are designed for 72 hours long missions. Their aircraft provide protection against electromagnetic radiation and nuclear blast.Secondary missions assigned to the E-4B include VIP travel along with Federal Emergency Management Agency support, which facilitates communications in relief works following natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. The company's defense segment stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time. Effective July 2017, it created a new segment — Boeing Global Services (BGS) — to include its  Commercial Aviation Services businesses, and certain Boeing Defense, Security & Services (BDS) businesses (primarily those previously included in the Global Services & Support segment). The move is expected to enhance product efficiency and lower costs for Boeing's defense customers in addition to maintaining delivery schedules.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.For example in October, the company won a contract worth $240 million for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1. In the month prior to that, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $600 million to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program.Additionally, recent Senate approval for the $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. This, in turn, will most likely prove to be beneficial for defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) in the near term.Although BDS segment’s performance was weak in the third quarter of 2017, management expects this business unit is poised to grow, going forward. Considering the current favorable budgetary scenario, we anticipate that such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, like the latest one, will help Boeing to achieve its desired business expansion in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 81.5% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.1%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.  Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1895,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Missions Systems (RMS) has won a modification contract for exercising options to procure technical insertion (TI)-16 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) systems, pre-cable kits and A-RCI sonar engineering services.Contract DetailsValued at $102 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC.The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL. The deal is expected to be complete by December 2018.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2018 research and development test and evaluation, and fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on A-RCI SystemsA-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. It facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions and under-ice operations as well.In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems, which allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost than previously possible. Notably, the A-RCI TI 18-20 engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.Our ViewWith the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy’s focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. These are the areas that it must patrol and defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Considering this, the need for timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the ARCI submarine sonar system very much critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation’s naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.As geopolitical uncertainty continues to prevail across the globe, we expect renowned defense contractors like Lockheed Martin to win more such deals in the days to come. A quick peek into the company’s third-quarter earnings numbers also reflects this. In particular, the RMS segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 27.9% of the company’s total revenues.Moreover, the company's improved cash outlook for 2017 reflects enhanced cash performance at the Rotary and Mission Systems division. That said, the aforementioned contract gain has the potential to boost revenues at this segment.Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 19.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 36%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1896,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a contract for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1. It has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA.Contract DetailsPer the $240.2 million contract, Boeing will offer AWACS mission computing, navigation and communications upgrades as well as the next generation in identification, friend or foe enhancement designs. In addition, it covers foreign military sales to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Work will be carried out at Oklahoma City, OK and is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2019.A Brief Note on AWACSInitiated in 1977, Boeing’s AWACS was derived from its 707 model. Markedly, the company’s 707-320B and the E-3 airframe based system deals with command and control, and surveillance and communications activities for strategic and defensive missions. Also, it has been used by the U.S. Air Force, Japanese Air Self Defense Force, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, RSAF, the UK, and the French Republic.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and emerges by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog among its peers. In particular, the company’s key forte has been its combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.In September, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $600 million to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program. Again, it won a $676.6 million deal to offer full-rate production of six Lot 41 F/A-18E and eight F/A-18F aircraft. Going forward, we expect these recently won contracts to add impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Additionally, recent Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. This, in turn, might prove to be beneficial for defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have skyrocketed 93.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 54.4%. This impressive performance can be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1897,LMT,"Defense bellwether, Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Systems Corp., has won a modification contract worth $20.1 million. According to the latest contract Northrop will offer additional funds to upgrade EA-18G aircraft. The award was received from the U.S. Navy.Per the terms of the deal, the additional funds will help Northrop to enhance the airborne electronic attack (AEA) system for the AN/ALQ-218(V) 2 receiver on the EA-18G aircraft. Work related to this deal is expected to be accomplished by July 2019 and will be carried out in Point Mugu, CA.A Brief Note on EA-18G & AEAThe Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) EA-18G Growler is the most advanced AEA aircraft that can operate from an aircraft as well as from land bases. The EA-18G integrates advanced AEA capabilities which have been developed and manufactured by Northrop for identifying, degrading and destroying hostile radar-guided air defense and communication systems.Additionally, as the principal subcontractor to Boeing, Northrop designs and produces the EA-18G entire center fuselages and center barrel replacement assemblies and integrates all the associated subsystems including the electronic attack capabilities as well as conducting after-delivery product support.Our ViewBeing one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Northrop’s product line serves high-priority categories such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense satisfactorily. Northrop is a leading name in AEA technology, having designed, manufactured and delivered the first electronic attack systems more than five decades ago. Over the years, Northrop has refined and expanded AEA capabilities to ensure successful completion of missions.Rising terrorism and the recent spate in political hostility between the United States and North Korea have provided a solid boost to the aerospace and defense industry. Concurrently, the United States and its major allies’ move to strengthen their arsenals to combat the internal and external threats provided a substantial impetus to the stocks.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion which provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops.Consequently, the current scenario in this industry is anticipated to boost defense majors like Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), as is evident from increasing number of contracts being awarded by the Pentagon in recent months. We believe the latest contract is an instance of the same and expect the company to win more such deals, in days ahead.Price MovementSince Northrop’s announcement of Orbital ATK  acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 7.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.5%. This shows that the news of the acquisition has received positive response from the market. Zacks RankNorthrop presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1901,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit recently secured a modification contract for providing deployment system support to Trident II (D5) missile. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Valued at $71.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Majority of the work will be carried out in Cape Canaveral, FL; Sunnyvale, CA and Magna, UT; while the rest will be executed at various other locations across the United States. The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 as well as fiscal 2017 weapons procurement, research, development, test, and evaluation funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.Notably, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile is a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.With frequent missile threats that the United States has been receiving from North Korea, in past few months, a subsequent rise in contracts from Pentagon related to enhancement of the nation’s missile security has been observed. In particular missile-makers Raytheon Company as well as Lockheed Martin has been winning ample orders to this end.Given Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, Lockheed Martin has been securing valuable contracts for this product, like the one worth $419 million it won last month. This, along with the latest contract win, is expected to boost the company’s Space Systems business.Moreover, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up about 14.1% in last six months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 19.6%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1902,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract for the C-130J center wing box replacement program. This contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Contract DetailsPer the $21.3 million modification, Lockheed Martin will support the purchase of an additional quantity of five each C-130J center wing boxes, five each component kits and a project management review.With this modification, the total cumulative face value of the contract reaches $72.7 million.Work related to the deal will be carried out in Marietta and Atlanta, GA. The contract will use fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement funds to complete the deal by Sep 4, 2021.A Brief Note on C-130JC-130J Super Hercules is the latest model in Lockheed Martin’s Hercules family. It is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. The C-130J's crew includes only two pilots and one loadmaster because no navigator or flight engineer is required on the aircraft. Among its missions, the C-130J counts capabilities as diverse as special ops, aerial refueling, close air support, search and rescue, and personal recovery.The J-model is almost similar to the classic Hercules in terms of general appearance. However, it uses updated technology like the new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc that comes with the Dowty R391 composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics and reduced crew requirements. These improvements have boosted its performance over C-130E/H predecessors. In particular, this latest model comes with 40% greater range, 21% higher speed and 41% reduced take-off distance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics business division is engaged in the production and upgradation of advanced military aircraft including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Notably, C-130J is one of the major Aeronautics programs of the company as well as of the U.S. Air Force.In 2016, Lockheed Martin delivered 24 C-130J aircraft, five of which were offered to international customers. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had 88 of these aircraft in its backlog, which is anticipated to increase in the coming days courtesy of the latest won deal.Moreover, given the recently growing demands from overseas market for this tactical aircraft, (particularly from France and Israel) we can expect the company to secure similar contracts related to C-130J jets in the days ahead.Interestingly, in its latest quarterly results, the company’s Aeronautics division witnessed revenue growth of 14%, with sales volume from C-130J program being one of the driving factors. Going ahead, given the strong demand for C-130J, more similar deals can be expected in coming days, which in turn will make the C-130J program as one of the primary growth drivers for the company.Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 20% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 36.7%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1903,LMT,"L3 Technologies Inc (LLL  -  Free Report) announced that its business unit has been awarded a $27.7-million modification contract for T-1A aircraft from the U.S. Air Force. Per the terms of the deal, the company will provide contractor-operated maintained supply services, over and above, on-equipment maintenance along with data and field service representatives. Work related to the contract will be carried out at multiple locations and are expected to be concluded by Jan 31, 2018.T-1A aircraft is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer aircraft for advanced pilot training. It is used by the Air Force for flying strategic/tactical airlift or tanker aircraft.L3 Technologies’ Long-Term StrategyL3 Technologies is transforming its business portfolio to focus more on defense electronics, communications and ISR markets where it has leading positions. The company follows a disciplined divestment strategy to efficiently focus on core operations. The Aerospace Systems (AS) segment of the company delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides engineering, modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems.Additionally, the company is also gaining from inorganic growth. The company has made regular strategic expansions, such as Implant Sciences’ explosives trace detection (ETD) assets. This also includes the acquisition of OceanServer Technology, Inc, a developer and manufacturer of autonomous, lightweight Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in recent times which have further boosted its product portfolio. With the acquisition of Implant Sciences, L3 Technologies’ capabilities in the global aviation security and national security markets were highly enhanced.Defense ScenarioThe defense industry got a heavy boost when the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The remaining $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.This increased budget is expected to rake in more orders for various companies in the industry such as Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc. which are dealing with different verticals of U.S. Defense.Price MovementShares of L3 Technologies have rallied 25.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 22.3%.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1904,LMT,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Space Systems, recently secured a contract for conducting the Airborne Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R) program. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Oct 2, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $80.8 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will conduct technology maturation and risk reduction for delivering a preliminary design and developing a fully functional prototype.  The company will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation funds to complete the task at Littleton, CO.Moreover, through this agreement, ALCS-R aims to replace the legacy Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) with an affordable system, to support the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile weapon system. This replacement is expected to be complete by 2036. This in turn will offer a solution to meet the survivable launch platform — airborne fire control requirements for the ground based strategic deterrent weapon system through 2075. A Brief Note on Minuteman IIIThe Minuteman III is a strategic weapon system of the United States that uses a ballistic missile of intercontinental range. Through the state-of- -art improvements, the Minuteman system has evolved to meet new challenges. Modernization programs have expanded targeting options and improved accuracy and survivability of this system.Our ViewALCS help in conducting missile tests and deploying missiles successfully. During loss of command capability between the launch control center and remote missile launch facilities ALCS automatically assume command and control of the isolated missile or missiles.It is imperative to mention in this context that Lockheed Martin enjoys a legacy in developing operational intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and has been continuously supporting the Air Force’s ICBM mission since the beginning, as the developer of the Atlas, Titan, MX Peacekeeper and Small ICBMs. Also the company is the leading provider of ground command and control systems for today’s Minuteman III.With increasing geopolitical tensions across the globe, it has become a necessary mandate for nations to stock up their arsenals to defend terrorist attacks. For the United States, the frequent missile tests conducted by North Korea have been sending a strong message of hostility toward America for past few months. As a result, the latter has been enthusiastically strengthening its missile stack in recent periods. The latest contract for ALCS-R reaffirms this fact.With Lockheed Martin being the largest defense contractor worldwide and given its combat-proven military equipments, we can expect more such contracts to usher in from Pentagon, which in turn will substantially boost its growth trajectory.Moreover, the recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion also buoys optimism for investing in major defense stocks. Therefore the time is ripe to add defense primes like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) in your watchlist.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 32.2% over a year, underperforming the 50.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in the same space is General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), which holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1906,LMT,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit secured a modification contract for new procurement of Trident II (D5) missile production, D5 life extension production and D5 deployed systems support. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $418.7 million, the contract has been awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. It includes base items and all option items, which if exercised, will enhance the total value of the modification to $1.1 billion.Per the terms of the agreement, majority of the work will be executed in Sunnyvale, CA and Cape Canaveral, FL. The remaining part will be carried out at different other regions of the United States.Fiscal 2017 weapons procurement (Navy) and United Kingdom funds will be utilized to complete the task.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.Markedly, these missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.In September 2016, the Navy launched an unarmed Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, following which Lockheed Martin announced that it is building on a 60-year partnership with the Navy. The declaration was made to ensure that the missile system remains capable for decades through the company’s shared robust flight test plan.Going forward, we expect the latest contract to substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory.  Also, the defense prime remains confident of winning more of such contracts in the near term, given that Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 29.4% in the last one year, underperforming the 50.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1907,LMT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Ordnance and Tactical Systems secured a contract worth $59.9 million for 30mm x 173mm armor piercing, fin stabilized, discarding sabot with tracer cartridges.The deal has been awarded by the Army Contracting Command, NJ. Work related to it is scheduled to be completed by May 31, 2021.Defense Scenario Driving OrdersWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the past few years along with more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the U.S. Aerospace-Defense industry with the nation being the largest weapon supplier. Again, the growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times.Furthermore, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Co. (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the days to follow.In September 2017, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion. The bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Therefore, this bill is expected to drive revenue growth for General Dynamics, one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Our TakeGeneral Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the leading commercial disposer of explosive materials and devices in the United States. It is also one of the leading manufacturers of mortar weapons and systems, bomb bodies and propellants.Notably, this business unit of General Dynamics has been producing 30mm ammunition for over 40 years. The 30mm x 173mm family includes armor-piercing, anti-personnel, airburst and low cost training ammunition that offer enhanced accuracy, penetration and lethality necessary to defeat a spectrum of threats on the battlefield.This units valued expertise in design, development and manufacturing of cartridges, included in the latest contract, establishes General Dynamics as a globally recognized supplier of high quality ammunition.Consequently, strong demand for such ammunitions has been boosting the company’s revenue growth. Evidently, during the third quarter of 2017, the Combat Systems segment, which constitutes Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit, generated 13% revenue growth year over year. Going forward, we can expect consistent growth in the segment's top line driven by strong demand for its products and frequent contract wins.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 14.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.3%. The underperformance might have been caused by the company’s declining backlogs in recent times. Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1908,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract worth $37.7 million in relation to F-35 fighter jet. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX and Samlesbury, UK.Per the terms, the company will exercise an option to conduct software conversions for structure and systems datasets. These conversions will be done to support the production of the 10th lot of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 joint strike fighter.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command Patuxent River, MD. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy and Marine Corps); fiscal 2017 (Air Force and Navy); and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants funds will be utilized to complete the task by June 2020.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project.In this regard, Lockheed Martin inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate owing to Trump's intervention or to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.The company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next few years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35, while in August 2017 it won a contract worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders, thus boosting the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have moved up 19.1% over a year, underperforming the 30.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

It will be executed in Vermont and will utilize Army working capital funds of fiscal 2018 through 2021.Regular OrdersGeneral Dynamics holds a strong position in the domestic as well as international defense space. In fact, Huntington Ingalls Inc (HII  -  Free Report) and this defense major are the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. Also, General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. This, in turn, allows the company to win notable contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies.Last month, General Dynamics secured a modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets. Again, in September, it had clinched a $341.2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines. Also, a $5.1 billion special incentives contract has been awarded to General Dynamics for completing the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Going forward, we expect such awards to bolster the company’s revenue growth.Defense Scenario Driving OrdersWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory.

1911,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has once again declared a hike in its quarterly dividend to reward its valuable investors. Per the latest hike, the company will pay a dividend of $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting a 10% rise from the previous dividend of $1.82. This will result in annualized dividend worth $8.00 and the consequent dividend yield of 2.6%, based on its current price of $310.29.Interestingly, this hike marks the 15th year in a row when this defense prime has increased its quarterly dividend rate by 10% or more. On Dec 29, 2017 management will pay the surged dividend to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec 1, 2017.The Raised Share Repurchase PlanUnder Lockheed Martin’s current program, it has recently authorized additional share repurchase of $2 billion, thus bringing the company’s total authorization value to $4 billion for future share repurchases.Notably, during the six months that ended on Jun 25, 2017, Lockheed Martin repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $1 billion. At that time the company was left with a share repurchase authorization of $2.5 billion.Our ViewCertainly, the aforementioned announcements made by Lockheed Martin are indicative of its strong capital structure. In fact, a meticulous study of the company’s recent cash flow statement reveals the generous amount of cash this defense major generates. Also, it justifies the fact that huge demand for Lockheed Martin’s industry-leading combat equipments have made it the largest defense contractor in the United States.During the second quarter, Lockheed Martin generated cash from operations worth $1.54 billion, up 4.8% year over year. Again, the company bought back 1.9 million of shares for $500 million. Markedly, with about $278 million in capital expenditures in the reported quarter, it had $1.3 billion of free cash flow at the quarter-end. Also, the company paid dividends of $525 million and returned 81% of free cash flow to its stockholders. This in turn reflects Lockheed Martin’s strong cash deployment strategy.Based on Lockheed Martin’s strong financial position and the several major contracts that it has been winning, we expect the company’s shareholders to witness similar dividend hikes, going forward.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied 28.5% in the last year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 49.3%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the company’s top line growth.Zacks Rank &Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1912,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently clinched a modification contract for purchase of long lead material and parts related to low rate initial production (LRIP) of F-35 Lightning II air systems. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by December 2018.Details of the DealValued at $1.5 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. The deal will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants and foreign military sales (FMS) customers.Per the modification, the long lead material and parts will be acquired for 145 of the 13th Lot of F-35 jet for the Services, non-U.S. DoD participants and FMS customers, and for 69 of the 14th Lot of the aircraft for the non-U.S. DoD participants and FMS customers.Majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth, TX; El Segundo, CA; Warton, United Kingdom and Orlando, FL. The deal includes 24% of the work for the Air Force; 11% for the Marine Corps, 3% for the Navy, 44% for the non-U.S. DoD participants and 18% for international partners.Notably, fiscal 2017 advanced procurement (Navy and Air Force), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Marine Corps), non-U.S. DoD participant and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the project.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. In this regard, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Also, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provides F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales and 64% of Aeronautics division’s revenues in 2017. Evidently, the company’s top line grew 12% in the fourth quarter at its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon each year and 2018 is also no exception. Last month, the company won a delivery contract worth $159 million for this program. In the same month, it also secured a $148 million deal for designing and development of the program to support the Israel government. Considering these contract wins, we may expect the Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456  aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers as well as expressions of interest from other countries.Additionally, Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. In particular, the budget proposal hints at an increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and has allotted $10.7 billion for procurement of 77 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 27.3% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. This underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1913,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract to exercise an option for providing class services in support of the Littoral Combat Ship program. The contract includes foreign military sales (FMS) to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Contract DetailsValued at $22.7 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. While the majority of the work will be carried out in Hampton, VA, the rest will be executed in Moorestown, NJ, and Washington, DC.Lockheed Martin will utilize FMS funds for the Navy to complete the work by July 2018.A Brief Note on LCSAn LCS is a type of relatively small surface vessel used for operations in the littoral zone. These are well designed to tackle rapidly changing global threats and provide a cost-effective solution.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s newest LCS. The program of building these Freedom-class ships involves 900 companies in 43 states.Although the Navy is most likely to purchase 52 LCS ships, government officials have asked them to reduce the count. Earlier, Defense Secretary Carter had made a proposal to the Navy for lowering the purchases to 40 ships. However, Navy officials have remained unchanged in their initial target of 52 ships.In fact, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States.Moreover, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This, in turn, has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Considering the aforementioned developments, Lockheed Martin is expected to win more of such contracts in the long run.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 19% in a year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36%.

It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space.

1916,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the opening bell.We believe order procurement to be a primary growth driver for this defense bellwether’s upcoming third-quarter results. On the other hand, segment operating profit is expected to reflect conflicting numbers in the quarter.Let's have a detailed look at the factors influencing Lockheed Martin’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy of its varied military product offerings.Among the contracts this defenese major won in the third quarter, the significant ones include a $3.8 billion foreign military sales (FMS) deal for multi-year production of Black Hawk helicopters, a contract worth $409 million for Next Generation Thermal, Power, and Controls (NGT-PAC) program and a modification contract worth $5.6 billion to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.The company also won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract worth $499 million, another deal worth $900 million for the replacement of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile and a modification contract worth $548 million to support production requirement of a Hellfire II missile.It goes without saying that such steady inflow of orders will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Q3 sales growth is pegged at $12.83 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.04%.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteOperating Profit: A Mixed BagDuring its second-quarter earnings call, Lockheed Martin raised its total segment operating profit for 2017, citing improved expectations for Aeronautics business unit, for the remaining year.  Our consensus estimate also predicted numbers in line with this expectation. Thus this segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $535 million, up 23.8% year over year.However, the consensus estimate for the Space Systems business unit reflects an annual decline of 11.8% to $224 million, in contrast to an improved number expected by the company.Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise each of Lockheed Martin’s segments has positive sales growth expectation, in line with what management hinted last quarter. Our consensus estimate showed notable sales growth in all the three segments of Lockheed Martin in the third quarter.However in terms of bottom-line growth, expectations are not so bright for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $3.25 per share, down 9.9% year over year. Moreover, this estimate has declined by a couple of cents in past 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of -0.68%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.23, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) is expected to report quarterly results on Oct 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.04% and a Zacks Rank #3.Leidos Holdings, Inc.

1917,LMT,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems (‘’RMS’’), secured a modification contract for offering equipment upgrades and spares to the AEGIS Weapon System baseline located in Japan. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2020.Details of the DealValued at $49.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will also supply systems engineering and staging services support, in relation to the AEGIS baseline, to the Japanese Computer Program Test Site.Majority of work for this foreign military sales (FMS) deal will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ. The remaining work will be carried out in Yokosuka, Japan and Clearwater, FL.A Brief Note on AegisAEGIS is an integrated missile-guidance system. With Lockheed Martin as its primary manufacturer, the AEGIS Weapons system is used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships.Over time, AEGIS has become an integral part of the U.S. Navy by developing sophisticated capabilities to counter emerging threats and leverage new technologies. Its latest configuration, Baseline 9, offers an open architecture framework to allow extreme flexibility.Our ViewLockheed Martin's RMS segment carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics, along with military and commercial orders. It generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting 3% year-over-year growth.In light of the recently won FMS contract, we expect this segment to witness similar or even more revenue growth in coming quarters.Currently, Lockheed Martin's AEGIS is the maritime weapon system of choice for six powerful nations. As of January 2017, 84 U.S. Navy ships were in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed. This number will definitely rise given the strong demand for AEGIS prevalent across the globe. Considering these developments, we expect Lockheed Martin to win more contracts like the latest one, in days ahead, which, in turn, will boost its profitability.Moreover, the latest Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

1918,LMT,"Textron Inc (TXT  -  Free Report) announced that its Aviation Defense segment has been awarded a $30-million contract for maintenance training of the Beechcraft King Air 350. This deal is part of foreign military sales (“FMS”) for Iraq. Work related to the contract will be carried out at the Martyr Mohammed Ali Air Base, Iraq. Operations are expected to be concluded by Sep 20, 2020. An amount of $9 million from the FMS fund will be obligated at the time of the award.Originally developed by Beechcraft, King Air 350 has more payload capability and range. It is designed for a quieter interior with standard Wi-Fi and Pro Line Fusion avionics with full touch-screen simplicity. The aircraft can fly at an altitude of 35,000 feet, thanks to its pressurized cabin and can take off and land on unimproved fields too.Importance of Foreign Military SalesForeign military sales became an important tool of generating revenue for the U.S. defense contractors, in addition to the orders received from the different verticals of U.S. Defense. Defense contracts from the U.S. allies helped the contractors maintain their top line during tough times. Moreover, when these contracts are carried on in the right manner, they help in strengthening the regional security, strengthen alliances, lighten United States' warfighting burden, improve the trade balance and create jobs.The Defense Contract Management Agency regulates the FMS contracts. The purchasers place the orders directly to the contractors. Instead, the agency acts as an intermediary and handles the procurement, logistics and delivery and often providing product support, training and infrastructure construction.What is Boosting Textron?Textron is globally recognized for popular and valuable brand names, such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee. Textron’s geographically diverse network of businesses negates any specific business risk. Its systematic inorganic growth strategy, along with its focus on strengthening international presence, is helping it in boosting results.The company has adopted the policy of spreading its operations in new fields with strategic acquisitions. During the first quarter, Textron completed its earlier announced acquisition of Arctic Cat, a leader in the recreational vehicle industry, for $247 million which expanded its presence in the power-sports segment and utility vehicle market. At the end of 2016, the company completed the acquisition of Premier and SAFEAERO, manufacturers of aircraft de-icing equipment. These expansions are likely to contribute to the company’s overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash.The company and its peers, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc., are also expected to gain from the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion by the U.S. Senate. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.Price MovementShares of Textron have gained 10.5% during the last month outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.6% during the same time.  This outperformance could be attributed to the systematic inorganic growth strategy along with its focus on strengthening international presence, which has boosted Textron’s growth trajectory.Zacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1919,LMT,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Ordnance and Tactical Systems (‘’OTS’’), secured a modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Mar 31, 2020.The contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The company will carry out the procurement task at Williston, VT. Fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 aircraft procurement funds as well as fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 other funds will be utilized to complete the work.  Notably, fiscal 2010 foreign military sales funds will also be used.A Brief Note on Hydra RocketsHydra rockets, better known as Hydra-70, represent a family of 2.75-inch unguided rockets that offer several warhead configurations. They can be used for point and area targets. The missiles are part of a lethal yet lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability like anti-material, anti-personnel, air-to-ground suppression and illumination.The rocket system can be installed on most of the rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. Incidentally, it is the most commonly used helicopter-launched weapon system in the world.Our ViewWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, the global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the U.S. Aerospace-Defense industry, with the nation being the largest weapon supplier.Being one of the major players in the defense business, General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. In North America, the company maintains a market-leading position in the supply of Hydra-70 rockets, in munitions space. Thanks to the significant demand for this high-end rocket system, General Dynamics has produced more than four million Hydra-70 rockets since 1996. The latest modification contract indicates this production number to increase substantially in coming days, which in turn will boost the company’s growth trajectory.According to a recent report by Transparency Market Research, the global rockets and missiles market is expected to reach a value worth $43 billion by 2025, reflecting a CAGR of 3.2% from 2016.

1920,LMT,"Defense prime Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., secured a contract for procuring 2103 signal processors, seven Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM), Signal Processor Replacement (LSPR) assemblies and more than 1 million advanced threat warning (ATW) sensors. Work for the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 2019.Details of the DealValued at $21.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of agreement, the company will also supply seven smart connector assemblies for LSPR to support the LAIRCM program.Majority of the work will be carried out in Rolling, Meadows, IL and Goleta, CA; while the rest will be executed at various other locations within as well as outside the United States. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement; research, development, test and evaluation; as well as other defense agency funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on LAIRCMThe LAIRCM system provides safety to onboard troops in a hostile situation. It is an active countermeasure that can automatically detect a missile launch. On identifying a missile, LAIRCM activates a high-intensity, laser-based countermeasure system to track and destroy the missile automatically. The primary purpose of the LAIRCM program is to protect large aircraft from man-portable missiles.Northrop Grumman’s LAIRCM system will be reinforced with new technologies to neutralize increasing threats and lower the overall handling costs for the U.S. Department of Defense.Our ViewOf late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour. A well-equipped nation like the United States thus will always want to remain prepared for any sudden attacks.Moreover, over the past few months, repeated missile threats from North Korea have forced the United States to ramp up its focus toward its missile defense space. Undoubtedly, this has led the Trump administration to multiply its arsenal treasury, both in terms of attacking missiles as well as accumulating protective measures like LAIRCM.Currently, Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system is the only DIRCM system in production that protects an aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. LAIRCM is one variant of such a DIRCM. Considering the present situation in the nation and Northrop’s combat-proven LAIRCM, more contracts like the recent one can be expected to boost Northrop’s sales.Moreover, the latest Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors likeNorthrop, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

1921,LMT,"Defense major Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Systems Corp., recently clinched a modification contract for installing ZPY-8A/N radar in MQ-8C Fire Scout helicopter. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by May 2020.Details of the DealValued at $15.2 million, the contract was awarded by Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the deal, the company will install original equipment manufacturer (OEM) ZPY-8A/N radar in MQ-8C chopper. Alongside, Northrop will integrate the initial radar A-kit and provide additional non-recurring engineering in the aircraft.Majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth, TX and Ozark, AL; while the remaining part will be carried out in San Diego and Santa Clarita, CA and Edinburgh, U.K. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on MQ-8CFire Scout is a combat proven, autonomous helicopter system designed by Northrop, which offers real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target-acquisition (ISR&T), laser designation, and battle management to tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. There are two variants of Fire Scout, MQ-8C being one of them.MQ-8C Fire Scout is the Navy’s next generation autonomous helicopter. Its airframe is based on the commercial Bell 407, an advanced helicopter with more than 1,600 airframes produced by Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report).The helicopter can take-off and land on any aviation-capable ship from both prepared and unprepared landing zones automaticatically. This helps to lower the reliance on man power. This enhancement increases the target range and endurance (more than double) and payload capacity (more than triple) of the helicopter.Our ViewBeing one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Northrop’s product line serves high-priority categories such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense satisfactorily. With more than 75 years of experience in advanced autonomy from the sea-floor to space, Northrop’s autonomous systems expand the boundaries of human potential to deliver end-to-end solutions that meet evolving mission requirements for a rapidly changing world. On top of that, its management is consistently innovating to ensure that the company’s autonomous platforms can meet the evolving mission requirements of its customers, both domestic and overseas.Meanwhile, rising terrorism and the recent spate in political hostility between the United States and North Korea have provided a solid boost to the aerospace and defense industry. Concurrently, the United States and its major allies’ move to strengthen their arsenals to combat the internal and external threats provided a substantial impetus to the stocks.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion which provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops.Consequently, the current scenario in this industry is anticipated to boost defense majors like Northrop, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), as is evident from increasing number of contracts being awarded by the Pentagon in recent months. We believe the latest contract is an instance of the same and expect the company to win more such deals, in days ahead.Price MovementSince Northrop’s announcement of Orbital ATK  acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 5.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.1%. This shows that the news of the acquisition has received positive response from the market.Zacks RankNorthrop presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1922,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit recently secured a contract for procuring modified ballistic re-entry vehicle/re-entry vehicle separation modules.  Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Dec 31, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $80.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. The terms of the deal include development; production; storage and surveillance; maintenance of delivered hardware and software; and transportation of end items to the designated launch vehicle provider. Further this contract entitles Lockheed Martin to offer additional quantity, integration, analysis, and mission support.The entire work in connection to this contract will be executed in Huntsville, AL. Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds will be utilized to partially finance the task and the rest will be funded incrementally.A Brief Note on Re-Entry VehicleAs part of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), Lockheed Martin receives high-fidelity threat system ballistic missile performance requirements from the government and builds ballistic missile targets to meet those requirements and represent real-world threats. Such countermeasures are designed to increase the probability that the re-entry vehicle from the threat missile reaches its intended target.  These target practices are essential components of BMDS, as it tests the efficiency of the ballistic missiles and in turn keeps one ready in situations of adversities. Modified Ballistic Re-Entry Vehicle is one of the components of such target programs.Our ViewWith increasing geopolitical tension across the globe, it has become a necessary mandate for nations to stock up their arsenals. For the United States, the frequent missile tests conducted by North Korea have been sending a strong message of hostility toward America for the past few months. As a result, the latter has been strengthening its missile stack in recent period. To strengthen its missile power, more target practices are needed which in turn has pushed the demand for such re-entry vehicles. The latest contract reaffirms this fact.With Lockheed Martin being the largest defense contractor worldwide and given its combat-proven military equipments, we can expect more such contracts from the Pentagon, which in turn will substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.53 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 (as per Markets and Markets). Further, the recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion also buoys optimism for investing in major defense stocks. Therefore the time is ripe to add defense primes, like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) in your watchlist.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 19.9% over a year, underperforming the 30.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1923,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has won a modification contract to identify and execute cost savings projects in order to reduce the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter air system.Contract DetailsValued at $60million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The work is scheduled to be completed by July 2020 and will use fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps) funds. While majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, the rest will be performed in multiple locations across the United States and the United Kingdom.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat and single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.Notably, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors with Lockheed Martin being the primary partner. Evidently, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. In addition, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump on being an overtly expensive project. In this context, Lockheed Martin finally inked a deal worth $8.5 billion with Pentagon this February with the intent of delivering 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to keep management’s earlier promise to cut down cost by 6–7%.Going forward, Lockheed Martin's management is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next couple of years. This, in turn, is anticipated to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders, thus boosting the company’s profits in the near term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1924,LMT,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a $45.5-million contract by the U.S. Navy for the Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar system. According to the company, 50% of the work related to the contract will be carried out at its Dallastown, PA facility and the rest will be done at New Kent, Virginia (11 percent); Premont, Texas (11%); Vieques, Puerto Rico (11%); Chesapeake, Virginia (10%); Marlborough, Massachusetts (3%); Freer, Texas (2%) and Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico (2%). Operations are expected to be concluded by September 2022.Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar systemThe Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar system was developed to detect aircraft at any altitude or boats on the water. It works by refracting radar signals off the ionosphere which bounces back to the ground and up again. This radar is being used by the navy since 1986.This system runs 24 hours a day, throughout the year and was once able to seize 4.5 metric tons of cocaine, valued at about $90 million. Its surveillance area is known to cover more than 10 million square miles of land and water. It consists of a transmit array and a receiving array in Texas, Virginia and Puerto Rico. It was designed and built by Raytheon. The company has also provided operations support and maintenance over the time.Moving Forward with Strong PerformanceRaytheon has a wide range of combat-proven defense product which helps it in securing scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the nation. The company wins regular contracts from various sources, both domestic and international. About 34.7% of the company’s total booking during the second quarter was international booking, marking an increase of 2.4% year over year. Thanks to its strong performance, the company reported better-than-expected earnings during the second quarter of the year.Notably, the defense scenario across the world at present, demands for new and innovative weapon which and defend a country and if the situation arises can help it in fighting too. This situation is not just limited to the United States but also other countries, fighting terrorism internally and externally. This has presented numerous opportunities to the defense giants such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report). The companies are already witnessing elevated number of contracts from the country and its allies.Recently, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.It is expected that this bill will rake in more new orders for the contractors and will boost both their top line and bottom line.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1925,LMT,"Aircraft giant The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) won a five-year basic ordering contract worth $41.5 million for supplying spare parts for F/A-18 E/F aircraft. Work pertaining to the deal will be carried out in Missouri.The contract has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 through 2021 Navy working capital funds to complete the task by Sep 30, 2021.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor — the F/A-18C/D — but contains 42% lesser structural parts.Our ViewWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spendings, the international market for defense equipment has been on an upward growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the Aerospace-Defense industry.Being one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. Banking on its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been winning contracts from the Pentagon for long. Last quarter, the company’s military aircraft business contributed $2.9 billion to its total revenues. Thanks to the recently won contract, we expect the company to witness similar solid revenue growth in this business, in the coming quarters.Moreover, last week’s Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1926,LMT,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract for procuring C-130J multi-year production aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2020.Valued at $61.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 Coast Guard aircraft procurement funds to execute the task at Marietta, GA.A Brief Note on C-130JC-130J Super Hercules, the latest model in Lockheed Martin’s Hercules family, is a four-engine, turboprop, military transport aircraft. The C-130J's crew includes just two pilots and one loadmaster, since no navigator or flight engineer is required on the aircraft. Among its missions, the C-130J counts capabilities as diverse as special ops, aerial refueling, close air support, search and rescue and personal recovery.The J-model is almost similar to the classic Hercules in terms of general appearance. However, it uses updated technology like the new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (RYCEY  -  Free Report) that comes with the Dowty R391 composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics and reduced crew requirements. These improvements have boosted its performance over C-130E/H predecessors. In particular, the improved J-model comes with 40% greater range, 21% higher speed and 41% reduced take-off distance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics business division is engaged in the production and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Notably, C-130J is one of the major Aeronautics programs of the company as well as of the U.S. Air Force.In 2016, Lockheed Martin delivered 24 C-130J aircraft, of which five were offered to international customers. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had 88 of these aircraft in its backlog, a number we believe will increase in the coming days, courtesy of the recently won deal. Given the growing demand that the company has been witnessing from overseas market for this tactical aircraft of late, in particular from France and Israel, we can expect it to fetch more similar contracts involving its C-130J jets in the days ahead.Interestingly, in its latest quarterly results, the company’s Aeronautics division witnessed  revenue growth of 19%, partially driven by higher sales volume from C-130J program. Looking forward, for 2017, the company has raised its outlook for this segment’s operating profit by $20 million. Undoubtedly, the recently won deal has advanced Lockheed Martin a step ahead in successfully achieving this target. With more similar deals expected in the future, the C-130J program can be considered as one of the growth drivers for the company.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 26.9% in the last year, underperforming the 41.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive, over last year. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1927,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has won a modification contract to support the first of class flying trials for F-35B aircraft and release military permit to fly the same from Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier. Notably, these jets will be used by the U.K. government.Contract DetailsValued at $11.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The work is scheduled to be completed by March 2018 and will use international partner funds.

It is designed to operate from a range of air-capable ships near front-line combat zones. Also, it can take off and land conventionally from longer runways on major bases.Also, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors with Lockheed Martin being the primary partner. While, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as along with air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years.

It will also be capable of seamlessly communicating the munition field status and location to the Mission Command based on the availability of an unclassified network.Spider Increment IA is a Special Interest Program with Office of the Secretary of Defense oversight (operational testing only).Development in Defense SpaceRising terror activities and current tension between the United States and North Korea have resulted into growth of the industry. In sync with this, the United States and its major allies have been strengthening their defense to combat the internal and external threats.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops.

1932,LMT,"Geopolitical risks have been rising as North Korea refuses to stop its threats. Moreover, with countries expanding their weapons system, defense stocks have been rallying lately.Is North Korea Driving Defense ETFs?On Sep 3, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created quite a stir in the United States and a number of Asian economies (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Per a Bloomberg article, the state-run Korean Central News Agency citing a statement by the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee said on Thursday, “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us.” The statement further added, “The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche”.Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the UN, told a UN conference, ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK (the Democratic Republic of Korea) will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.""These threats come as UN passed new sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions are aimed at starving North Korea of oil to run its nuclear program by reducing oil imports by the country. Although the United States aimed at total oil embargo on North Korea, sanctions were watered down in order to secure China and Russia’s support, as they held veto power on the decision.North Korea has received repeated warnings from the United States, that if it does not stop its nuclear tests, it will have to face significant military response. As a result, major nations have started focusing on their defense systems in order to prepare for any mishap.Strong FundamentalsThe earnings performance for the sector has been impressive in the second quarter and is expected to continue in the third quarter as well.

1933,LMT,"Defense major Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a modification contract worth $11 million, in relation to the Navy’s WSN-7 navigation system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by April 2019.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the modification, the company will exercise a one-year option for production and supply of associated provisioned items of WSN-7 navigation system. Work will be carried out in Charlottesville, VA. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on WSN-7 Navigation SystemThe Inertial Navigation System (INS) AN/WSN-7 is a passive shipboard navigation system, deployed in the U.S. Navy ships, to calculate and indicate ship's position, attitude, heading and velocity in relation to the earth's rotation. The INS senses motion (inertial), gravity and earth rotation and helps in navigation functions.Additionally, the INS receives GPS updates and the ship's speed. The system is capable of operating throughout the world without any external position reference information. Per the U.S. Navy, the INS is unsusceptible to jamming and cannot be also detected by the opposition.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. Its Mission Systems business segment provides services relation to navigation systems.During the second quarter of 2017, this segment witnessed 3% revenue growth, courtesy of higher sales volume. Going ahead, for 2017, the company raised its sales outlook for the segment on the anticipation of success in the coat-reduction initiatives that management undertook as well as solid sales volume, in particular for F-35 jets.Notably, the company has a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs which have aided it in securing regular contracts from different verticals of U.S. Defense. We believe winning contracts like the recent one will help Northrop Grumman in achieving its enhanced sales target for Mission Systems.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have returned 26.2% in the last year compared to the industry’s increase of 36.1%. This might have been led by the company’s escalating operating expenses.In addition, steep competition from peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1934,LMT,"Aerospace giant, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), has secured a modification contract to provide additional funding for the Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), Phase C for the F/A-18E/F aircraft.Notably, the SLAP and SLEP programs aid the extension of the service life of the F/A-18E/F jets beyond the original design of the 6,000 flight hours.Details of the DealValued at $42 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 30, 2021 and will be carried out in St. Louis, MS and El Segundo, CA.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. F/A 18E is a single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, which is about 25% larger than its predecessor, the F/A-18C/D, but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In particular, among other defense equipments, the company's key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, it has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Evidently, Boeing won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract  from the U.S. Air Force last week. The deal came up with a ceiling value of $499 million. Per the contract, the company will be responsible for providing quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. Again, last month, the company clinched a contract worth $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation. In this regard, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, the current budget scenario is favorable to the defense industry, which also buoys investors’ optimism. To this end, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill this July, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. The figure exceeded President Trump’s fiscal 2018 defense budget request proposed in March.If enacted, this budgetary amendment is expected to immensely boost Boeing and other defense major’s business in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 86.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 41.6%. This might have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. In addition, the company poses strong competition to its peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1935,LMT,"Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Ingalls Shipbuilding, has clinched a modification contract to continue providing integrated planning yard support for CG 47 and DD 963 class ships. Work for this deal will be over by September 2018.Details of the ContractValued at $73 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. The modification includes options that would bring the cumulative value of this deal to $150.8 million, if exercised.Per the modification, Ingalls Shipbuilding will offer planning yard support like Navy modernization program planning, ship change planning development and installation as well as operating cycle integration program management. It will also provide type commander support, mobile assist teams, rotatable equipment pools, ship configuration and logistics support, provisioned items orders and other material support, along with surface ship life cycle management support.Apart from these, the company will deliver hull mechanical and electrical engineering standardization efforts, apart from providing diminished manufacturing sources as well as material shortages identification, tracking, and resolution support.Per the deal, Huntington Ingalls will carry out the work in Pascagoula, MS. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy), and operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete operations.A Brief Note on CG-47 & DD 963USS Ticonderoga (CG 47) is an Aegis guided missile cruiser, jointly developed by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report). Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Tomahawk missiles were deployed in these warships. Currently, they are equipped with Aegis Combat System, which integrates the cruiser’s electronic sensors and weapons systems to engage anti-ship missile threats.Notably, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system, used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Meanwhile, built by Huntington Ingalls, DD 963 Spruance-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. It was designed to hunt down and destroy high speed submarines in all weather but can also engage ships, aircraft, and shore targets. These multi-purpose combatants are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with Marine amphibious operations worldwide.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of Huntington ships.Going forward, the company's overall growth momentum is expected to continue, given the recent positive budget revision done by the Trump administration. In this regard, it is imperative to mention the fiscal 2017 spending bill, which include Ohio-Class replacement, advanced procurement for refueling CVN-74, advanced procurement for CVN-80, two Virginia class submarines and two DDG-51s, advanced procurement for LHA-8 and TAO(X), besides continuation of CVN-79 and investment in a new Coast Guard Icebreaker.Moreover, we believe the recently won contract by Huntington Ingalls to be a part of this spending bill and indicative of the fact that the U.S. Navy remains focused toward modernizing its existing fleet of warships. Hence, we can expect to witness more such contracts for Huntington Ingalls, in the coming days, which in turn will boost the company’s growth trajectory.Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied 32.7% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 41.6%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line. Additionally, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1936,LMT,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) won a modification contract worth $12.8 million, to provide yard services for CG-47-class cruisers and DD 963-class destroyers to the U.S. Navy. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2018.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, the company will provide long lead-time material procurement and management services for lifetime for both maintenance and modernization of these ships. The services include necessary engineering, technical, planning, ship configuration, data as well as logistics efforts.The contract was awarded by the Shipbuilding, Conversion, and Repair, Gulf Coast, Pascagoula, MS; and will utilize fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task at Pascagoula, MS.A Brief Note on CG-47 & DD 963USS Ticonderoga (CG 47) is an Aegis guided missile cruiser, jointly constructed by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corp.

It is designed to hunt down and destroy high speed submarines in all weather, but can also engage ships, aircraft, and shore targets. These multi-purpose combatants are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with Marine amphibious operations worldwide.Our ViewThe Department of the Navy (DON) proposed its base budget of $171.5 billion this May, for fiscal year 2018. Striving to restore Navy readiness through this budget, the DON requested $54.6 billion for operations and maintenance, funding 100% of projected ship depot maintenance. Surely this scrumptious budget boosted the prospects of Huntington Ingalls, which is one of the two primary military shipbuilders in the United States.Further, majority of the new eight ships allotted for purchase by the Navy in fiscal 2018, will come from either Huntington Ingalls or General Dynamics. This provided further impetus to the stock, as a result of which, the company has witnessed an 8% rise in its share price, since the budget was proposed.Although this budget proposal has not yet been approved by the U.S. Senate, we believe the recently won contract is indicative of the fact that the U.S. Navy remains firm with its focus toward modernizing its existing fleet of warships. If the budget proposal gets eventually approved, we can expect to witness more such contracts for Huntington Ingalls, in the coming days. This will surely boost the company’s profit level, which in turn is most likely to get reflected in increased earnings for shareholders.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 29% in a year, underperforming the industry’s 40.3% gain. This could be because of the earlier budget cuts which have put pressure on the top line.

1937,LMT,"Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), has clinched a modification contract to incorporate an unpriced change order for acceleration and stabilization/restoration of supply rate for F-22 sustainment.Details of the DealValued at $70 million, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds to complete the work by Dec 31, 2019. Work related to the modification deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on F-22Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor is the fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft with a unique combination of stealth, speed, agility and situational awareness along with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry.However, high development costs, ban on exports and development of the more versatile F-35 aircraft led to the discontinuation of F-22 production.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Of late, there has been a rapid increase in terrorist activities across the globe. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Also, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favoured defense giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) among others.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill as well.

1938,LMT,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) secured a $17.3-million contract from the U.S. Army. The company will be working on development and production of the Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS). Per the contract, the company is expected to finish the related work by Sep 30, 2017. All the work related to the deal will be carried out at the company's facility in Boulder, CO.Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS)Joint Tactical Ground Station also known as JTAGS is the only deployable system which is capable of providing direct down linked, in-theater early warning of ballistic missile launches to the combatant commander. It gives passive defense by providing the early warnings by sending alerts when it detects enemy ballistic missile launch events. It also helps in active defense by cueing the air defense assets to the missile track. As of yet, there are five operational JTAGS systems.Northrop Grumman has a longstanding relationship with the U.S. Army in providing service for the JTAGS systems. Over the years, the company has improvised the system and has replaced the two prototypes that were built in Europe and Korea in 1993 and 1994, respectively for demonstration purpose.Growing Stronger New OrdersThe company is one of the largest defense contractors in the country. Owing to its vast product portfolio, the company enjoys a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs. Northrop Grumman also invests substantially in product innovation and has a strong focus on strengthening its ISR wing. This has helped the company in maintaining a stable earnings stream amid the rapidly changing needs of the defense landscape.The company receives orders from both domestic and international sources. The international market of the company accounted for 13.1% of its business in 2016. Of the recent FMS orders, notable ones include a $169-million deal that Northrop Grumman won in the reported quarter, for developing a new satellite communication system for Australia. The system will enable deployed military forces of the nation to connect to strategic information networks.Additionally, the current defense scenario has proved to be a great growth opportunity for the defense giants like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc. Recently, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. Of the total amount, about $640 billion is for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The remaining $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. There new orders are expected to flow in as a result of this newly passed bill.Expansion Via AcquisitionNorthrop Grumman recently announced that it will acquire Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.4 billion in net debt. Currently, the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals.

1939,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Rotary and Mission Systems, has won three modification contracts, totaling $63.9 million, from the U.S. Navy.Contract DetailsThe first contract, valued at $27 million, involves procurement of 11 standard and five SEED retrofit kits in support of the H-60 Automatic Radar Periscope Detect and Discrimination program. Scheduled to be completed by October 2020, majority of the work will be performed in Farmingdale, NY and the rest will be carried out across various locations in the United States.The second contract was awarded to support the Navy and the governments of Australia as well as Denmark. Per the deal, worth $23.1 million, Rotary and Mission Systems will procure non-recurring and recurring efforts that are necessary to produce, test and deliver 69 Generation VI Mission Computers, 87 Moving Map Integration Retrofit Wiring Kits (Navy, Australia, and Denmark), and 24 Audio Management Lite Computers for the MH-60R/S platform.This contract includes 92% of the purchases for the Navy, 6% for the government of Australia and 2% for the government of Denmark, under the Foreign Military Sales program. Scheduled to be completed by February 2020, majority of the work will be performed in Owego, NY and the rest will be carried out across various locations in the United States.The third contract is valued at $13.8 million. Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will exercise an option for material, travel, subsistence and support of the Integrated Submarine Imaging Systems program. Work is scheduled to be completed by September 2018. While majority of the work will be performed in Manassas, VI, the rest will be carried out across various locations in the United States.Our ViewLockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. The segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27% of its total revenue.Coming to order growth for this segment, its Sikorsky business line secured a $3.8 billion five-year contract for supplying 257 Black Hawk helicopters to the U.S. Army as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, in the second quarter.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States.Moreover, the budget proposal of $13.5 billion in addition to $25 billion that came from President Trump for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year has been allocated for a number of defense equipments.  We believe that if this proposal gets approved it will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s revenue growth, going forward.Considering the aforementioned developments, the company is expected to win more of such contracts in days ahead, given that most of its programs are the top priorities of Pentagon.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 26.8% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 39.1%. This could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Also, the stock’s performance lags compared with that of The Boeing Co.

1940,LMT,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) announced that it has received a new order from Qatar Airways worth $2.16 billion. Per the order, Boeing will supply two 747-8 Freighters and four 777-300ERs (extended range) to the airline.These orders for 747-8 Freighters will help Qatar Airways to further expand its cargo operations and serve more customers.  This deal extends the business relationship of the two companies. Qatar Airways is one of the best airliner operating in the Middle East and its fleet includes aircraft from Boeing as well as from its arch rival, Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report).Qatar Airways, at present operates nearly 100 airplanes manufactured by Boeing and has placed orders in excess of 100 airplanes from the latter.Boeing’s BacklogBoeing has delivered 3,482 commercial airplanes to its customers in the last five years. Despite this, its total commercial airplane backlog at the end of second-quarter 2017 was $424 billion, up from $417 billion at the end of first quarter. The commercial airplane backlog at the end of August 2017 was 5,665 airplanes.Boeing, with its current production rates, will require more than five to six years to cover up its current backlog.

1941,LMT,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)—whose technology was part of the agreement—Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) will all likely benefit.And recently, the industry has undergone a small wave of consolidation. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) announced a major $30 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report), creating one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufactures. Not long after, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) said it would be buying Orbital ATK  in order to expand and increase its defense footprint; Orbital notably holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket.As defense stocks and funds like the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) continue to gain this year, let’s take a look at three top picks for your portfolio.Engility Holdings Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, Engility Holdings provides government services in engineering, professional support, and mission support to customers in the U.S. Department of Defense, federal civilian agencies, and allied foreign governments. Its innovate solutions range from offering views of battlespaces to airborne platforms to providing advanced communications to support first responders, among many other services.Engility is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past seven quarters, boasting an average earnings surprise of 23.5%. Looking ahead, Engility expects year-over-year earnings growth of nearly 40% for the current year, with three positive revisions in the last 60 days. Sales, however, are expected to dip about 5% in the same time frame, but should bounce back by next fiscal year.Shares of EGL have had a quiet 2017 so far, but the company sits in a strong industry; Aerospace-Defense is in the top 23% of all industries ranked by Zacks, and has returned well over 38% year-to-date. Engility reports its next quarterly earnings in early November.Northrop Grumman Corp.Northrop Grumman provides innovative solutions in systems integration, defense electronics, and information technology for the U.S. and international militaries, government and commercial customers, as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or preferred supplier. Northrop is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Northrop has started off strong in 2017. Both its earnings and revenue figures for the second quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and it looks like the rest of the year will continue to see improved growth. Northrop expects year-over-year earnings growth of about 14% for the current year, and sales growth of about 3.18% for the same time frame; nine analysts have revised their earnings estimate upward in the last 60 days compared to none lower.Northrop also has a history of beating expectations, soaring past consensus estimates over the past four consecutive quarters. The defense contractor has an average earnings surprise of almost 12.6%. Like Engility, the company resides in the Aerospace-Defense industry. Northrop is set to report its next quarterly earnings on October 25 before the bell.Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)Known for designing nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, Huntington Ingalls Industries develops and produces warships like destroyers, amphibious transport dock ships, and national security cutters. The company also provides complex nuclear project management, and is based in Newport News, Virginia.Shares of Huntington have gained well over 24% year-to-date, and the Aerospace-Defense player is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. Looking at its current year, Huntington expects earnings growth of over 14% on sales growth of just 3.8%; four analysts have revised their earnings estimates upwards in the last 60 days compared to none lower. Historically, the company has seen EPS growth of 30.7%, and next fiscal year should see Huntington continue its earnings growth trend.Huntington has an average earnings surprise of about 8.5%, and is expected to report its next quarterly earnings on November 8 before the bell.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1942,LMT,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) secured a contract for the construction of a littoral combat ship (LCS). Work related to this deal is expected to be over by October 2023.Notably, an LCS is a type of relatively small surface vessel intended for operations in the littoral zone. These are well designed to tackle the rapidly changing global threats and provide a cost-effective solution.Details of the DealValued at $584.2 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Per the contract, the company will provide related LCS class services and material, along with integrated data environment support. The agreement also includes options for the construction of additional LCS, class services and post-delivery availability support. The Navy expects to order additional LCS class ships in the future.Per the terms of the agreement, majority of the work will be executed in Marinette, WS. The remaining part will be carried out at other regions of the United States.The deal will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds for construction of one fiscal 2017 LCS; and fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) for LCS class services and integrated data environment support.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Lockheed Martin is the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s newest LCS. The program of building these Freedom-class ships involves 900 companies in 43 states.It is important to note here that the Navy is most likely to purchase 52 LCS ships, but government officials have told the Navy to cut that number. Defense Secretary Carter had earlier made a proposal to the Navy to reduce purchases to 40. Navy officials have however, remained unchanged in their initial target of 52 ships.Going forward, we expect the latest contract to substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory.  Also, the defense prime remains confident of winning more of such contracts in the near term.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 35.7% in the last year, underperforming the 52.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense sector include Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).While Engility Holdings and Leidos Holdings sport a Zacks  Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Northrop Grumman holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Engility delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.50% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has moved up 2.3% in the last 60 days.Leidos Holdings delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 18.01% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has climbed 1.1% in the last 30 days.Northrop Grumman pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 12.60% in the last four quarters.

1943,LMT,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Aerospace Systems, has secured a contract for the Japan Global Hawk program.Valued at $130.5 million, the deal has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Per the agreement, Northrop Grumman will provide long lead material to commence the program for three global hawk block 30 (I) air vehicles, two ground control elements, improved integrated sensor suite, spares and a site survey.Scheduled to be completed by July 27, 2018, the work will be performed in San Diego, CA.The Global Hawk gained popularity mainly on its ability to transform itself into an operational weapons system as and when required. It was not only used by the Air Force for maintaining overseas surveillance after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but has also been used extensively by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for scientific research missions.Foreign military sales (FMS) provides the much needed respite at the time of negative defense budget revision and acts as a key performance catalyst for Northrop as well as other defense companies of United States. FMS are expected to contribute significantly to earnings given the solid prospects available in overseas.Development in Defense SpaceRising terror activities and current tension between the United States and North Korea have added to growth of the industry. In sync with this, theUnited Statesand its major allies has been strengthening their defense to combat the internal and external threats.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.Consequently, the current scenario in the defense industry is anticipated to further aid large companies like Northrop Grumman, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report).Our ViewNorthrop Grumman seems to benefit from a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs. Moreover, the company’s product innovation and focus on strengthening its ISR wing will help maintain a stable earnings stream amid rapidly changing requirements of the defense landscape.Being one of the largest domestic defense contractors, Northrop Grumman also gets regular orders from the various verticals of the U.S. Defense. It receives orders from the international market through foreign military sales (FMS) as well. Markedly, the company’s international market accounted for 13.1% of its business in 2016.Price MovementShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied 6.1% since Northrop Grumman's announcement of Orbital ATK  acquisition compared with the industry’s gain of 3.9%. This shows that the news of the acquisition has received positive response from the market.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Currently the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals. With the acquisition of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman will benefit from the former's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines. (Read More: Northrop Grumman Announces Orbital ATK Buyout for $9.2B).Diverse Product OfferingNorthrop benefits from a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs.

1945,LMT,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat Corp., has clinched a $5.1 billion special incentivescontract to complete design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).The contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractThe contract covers development of component and technology, efforts related to missile tube module and reactor compartment bulkhead prototyping and manufacturing, and United Kingdom Strategic Weapon Support System kit manufacturing for the Columbia class ballistic missile submarines.Notably, the deal has been was awarded to General Dynamics as its Electric Boat division currently owns the wholeworkforce of nuclear ballistic missile submarine design/engineering and data environment to support achievement of the highly specialized submarine design products and integration efforts required to meet all of the contemplated technical and schedule contract requirements.Majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT while the rest will be performed at Newport News and a few other places across the United States. It will be completed using 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2017 research, design, test and evaluation (Navy) and United Kingdomfundsby December 2031.About Columbia-class SubmarinesThe Columbia-class submarine program, formerly known as the Ohio replacement submarine program, was designed by the U.S. Navy to replace its existing force of 14 Trident-armed Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of 12 ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Originally built by Electric Corp., the Columbia-class submarines are operated by the United Kingdom, Russia, China, France and India.Under the Navy’s Submarine Unified Build Strategy (SUBS), the Columbia-class submarines will be jointly constructed by General Dynamics’ Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) Newport News division. Per the U.S. Navy’s request, General Dynamics continues to be the prime contractor for designing and building the Columbia-class boats.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. The company is a prime contractor for the development of Virginia-class submarines (another class of nuclear-powered submarine).Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the Columbia-class program as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Scenario Helping Industry GiantsThe growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests, along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times. Also, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favoured defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the long run.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Notably, the bill is expected to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 32.9% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.3%.This may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government in the defense space.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s 34.7% of the total booking during the second quarter was from the international orders, which reflects an increase of 2.4% year over year. During the quarter, international sales were up 4.3%, while 42% of its backlog comprised of international programs.Due to its strong order book from both in and out of the country, the company has reported better-than-expected earnings over a very long time. Raytheon has reported positive earnings surprises in all the last four quarters with a trailing average surprise of 7.87%.Defense Scenario Boosting GrowthWhile global terrorism has been a matter of great concern over a long time now, the escalating tension between United States and North Korea is comparatively a new issue. The major countries battling against terrorism are working hard to strengthen their defense and are preparing for internal and external tension.To this end, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. This new plan is expected to present greater opportunities for defense giants like Northrop, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1950,LMT,"Shares of companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), fell on Monday despite newly intensified rhetoric from North Korea regarding the possibility of war with the U.S.North Korea Tensions North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said on Monday that the U.S. had declared war on his country, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The foreign minister’s claim was reportedly in response to a Saturday flyover of U.S. bombers and fighter jets near North Korea—north of the Demilitarized Zone—and a tweet from President Donald Trump.But the U.S. has a different view of those flights, and President Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) Saturday to rebuke the North Korean foreign minister’s statements to the U.N. over the weekend.“This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,"" Defense Department spokesman Dana White said in a statement over the weekend. “North Korea's weapons program is a grave threat to the Asia-Pacific region and the entire international community.”Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017The North Korea minister told reporters on Monday that North Korea had “every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers, even if they are not yet inside the air-space border of our country.” The official said that every possible option for a North Korean response is on the table.Ri Yong Ho also said if North Korea takes action against U.S. military planes that “the question of who will be around much longer will be answered then.”U.S. officials were quick to respond and try to curb the further escalation of tensions. “We continue to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” State Department spokesman Justin Higgins said. ""No nation has the right to fire on other nations’ aircraft or ships in international airspace or waters.”White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also responded and said that claims that the U.S. declared war against Kim Jong Un’s regime were “absurd.”Defense StocksDespite the revved up and continued war of words between Washington and Pyongyang, shares of some of the biggest U.S. aerospace and defense companies fell.Lockheed Martin stock dipped 0.41% while Boeing saw its stock price fall 0.85%.

1952,LMT,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a modification contract from the U.S. Navy. The said contract is valued at $36.3 million.Per the terms of the contract, the company is expected to provide planned maintenance, facilities maintenance and administrative and engineering support services to the Navy. The mentioned amount for the contract will be obligated at the time of the award. Work related to the contract will be carried out at San Diego, CA. General Dynamics expects to complete contracted work by April 2018.Regular Order InflowGeneral Dynamics’ diverse portfolio of products and services aid it in securing regular contracts from various vertical of the U.S. Defense. The company is one of the two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the other one being Huntington Ingalls Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). This positions General Dynamics at a strategic advantage. Additionally, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have been in favor of the company’s business line.Earlier in August, General Dynamics’ business unit, Land Systems, secured a contract from the U.S. Army to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3. (Read More: General Dynamics' Unit Wins $311M U.S. Army Contract)The company’s business division, Electric Boat, was also awarded a $115.3-million modification contract to offer additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines from the U.S. Navy.

The company has been increasing R&D expenditures over the past three years. Notably, company-sponsored R&D expense increased 5.8% year over year to $418 million in 2016.The Defense ScenarioThere are multiple reasons which have boosted the defense sector in the recent times. Firstly, terror activities are constantly rising across the globe. United States and its allies are on high alert anticipating major threats and have been taking extra effort to strengthen their defense system.Secondly, the tension between the United States and North Korea is increasing. The conflict between these two countries has given a good boost to the major defense stocks like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls and others. The proposed 10% hike in the 2018 defense budget by President Trump is expected to rake in new orders to these giants.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have returned 29.3%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 32.2% in the last year.This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cuts will hurt the company’s growth prospects.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1953,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract, worth $600 million, to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Details of the ContractThis modification will supplement work that is already taking place under the PAR contract, which includes risk reduction activities and the acquisition of two commercial Boeing 747-8 aircraft.Per the contract, Boeing will complete preliminary design work for the modification of two 747-8 aircraft to replace the two aging VC-25A and Boeing 747-200, used as presidential support aircraft.The resulting modification to the aircraft, which is expected to be negotiated in a future contract modification, will include incorporating a mission communications system, electrical power upgrades, a medical facility, an executive interior, a self-defense system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities.Work is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2018 and will be executed in Seattle, WA. The contract will use fiscal 2017 research and development funds to complete the task. Future PlansFurther modifications are expected to be made in the contract, going forward.

1954,LMT,"Aerospace giant, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), has secured a modification contract to offer full-rate production of six Lot 41 F/A-18E and eight F/A-18F aircraft. The terms of the deal includes delivery of these aircraft as well.Details of the DealValued at $676.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The deal will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds to complete the task, which is scheduled to be over by February 2017. While majority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, the rest will be executed in St. Louis, MS and various other locations across the United States.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. Also, it is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier.A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor —the F/A-18C/D — but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In particular, the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft compared with the other defense equipments. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, this aerospace giant has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Evidently, Boeing won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract last week, from the U.S. Air Force. The deal came up with a ceiling value of $499 million. Per the contract, the company will provide quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter.Earlier, in August, the company clinched a contract worth $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Meanwhile, the current budget scenario seems favorable for the defense industry, which buoys investors’ optimism this industry’s bellwethers like Boeing. In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. Markedly, the figure exceeded President Trump’s fiscal 2018 defense budget request proposed in March, 2017. If enacted, this budgetary amendment is expected to immensely boost Boeing’s as well as other defense majors’ business growth, going forward.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 91.9% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 41.4%.

1955,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is one of the six companies to receive the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract from the U.S. Air Force, which has a ceiling value of $499 million.Notably, Boeing is the final company to receive this award from Pentagon.Contract DetailsPer the contract, the company will be responsible for providing quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. It was awarded by Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Boeing expects to complete the task by Aug 31, 2025. The work will be carried out at the company’s Hazelwood, MS facility, and will utilize the fiscal 2017 research and development funds to finish the task.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In particular, among other defense equipments the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. It also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late.Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been consistently securing a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon.For instance, in August, the company clinched a contract valued at $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation.. Again, it won a modification contract, valued at $222.5 million, for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, the proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and others.Further, the U.S. House of Representatives have passed the 2018 defense policy bill recently, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion.

1956,LMT,"On Sep 3, North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb — its sixth and largest nuclear device — that has been tested since 2006. Per the predictions, North Korea desires to be recognized as a nuclear state like Russia with the test of this nuclear bomb.Notably, the test sent jitters through global financial markets, as a result of which the broader market indices slipped on Sep 5. Also, it has considerably increased pressure on the Trump administration, with this nuclear test being the most severe foreign affairs emergency that the United States has witnessed in years.On a bright note, U.S. defense stocks took a surge following this nuclear test, which indicated at yet another altercation between North Korea and America.Why the Bomb Is a ThreatThe hydrogen bomb, which is claimed to be small and light, can be mounted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile. In fact, the test triggered a 6.3 magnitude tremor around the area of its test site.Also, North Korea’s Parliamentary Defense Committee estimated that the bomb had a yield of 100 kilotons. This indicates that it is seven times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima (13 kilotons) and five times more powerful than the one dropped on Nagasaki (20 kilotons).Earlier, North Korea had made claims of testing such weapons but failed to succeed. However, in a recent televised statement, the country declared that this time they succeeded and guaranteed that North Korea now possesses a credible nuclear warhead.Moreover, on Aug 29, North Korea had fired a missile that passed over Hokkaido — the second largest island of Japan — before landing in the sea. Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, stated the incident to be exceptional, serious and severe threat to the country itself. U.S. President, Donald Trump, also responded by saying 'all options on table’ when it comes to dealing with Pyongyang.Meanwhile, North Korea has been striving toward becoming a nuclear power over the last few years. Also, the relationship between the United States and North Korea has significantly become unpleasant in last few months. A frequent cross-border missile test exchanges have added to the woes for both the nations. On top of that, last month, Trump said that threats coming from North Korea ""will be met with fire and fury,"" further strengthening the inter-country tension.   Therefore, we note that if North Korea has in fact effectively tested a hydrogen bomb, then the threat to the United States and its allies raises considerably.How United States ReactedIn response to the news of the hydrogen bomb test, the U.S. Defense Secretary, James Mattis, gave a strict warning to North Korea. Mattis said that if North Korea involves in any act of violence against the United States or its allies then it would have to face a massive military response.However he also offered a word of reassurance to North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un. Mattis added that United States does not intend to totally eradicate the country although it has many options to do so.Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has hinted that it will search for additional steps to isolate North Korea’s economy subsequent to its latest actions, particularly in connection with testing of missiles and nuclear weapons.To this end, the United States may increase pressure on China to discontinue its oil imports to North Korea, a move which can cripple the country in economically.Defense Stocks in FocusThe prospects of the U.S. military action against North Korea have also increased following Mattis’ stern warning. In light of the recent events, the U.S. defense stocks are likely to witness considerable gains in the coming days. Here are few stocks in the defense space that are expected to grow.Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), the largest defense contractor in the world, possess some of the high-profile missile defense programs including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and PAC-3 Missiles.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its projected EPS growth for the next five years is 6.2%.

1957,LMT,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has clinched a contract regarding F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by December 2020.Details of the DealValued at $427.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.  Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will procure ancillary military equipment and pilot flight equipment for low rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th Lot of F-35 jets. The services will be offered to the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants and foreign military sales (FMS) customers.Majority of the work will be carried out in Inglewood, CA and White Plains, NY and the rest in St. Petersburg and Orlando, Fl and Fort Worth, TX. The order includes 36% of the work for the Air Force, 20% for the Marine Corps, 12% for the Navy, 19% for non-DoD participants and 13% for FMS customers.Fiscal 2015 aircraft procurement (Air Force and Navy), fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy), non-DoD participants and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the work.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors.Notably, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Moreover, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project.In this context, Lockheed Martin finally inked an $8.5 billion deal with Pentagon this February. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to maintain management’s earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.Going forward, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next few years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable Lockheed Martin to take a step toward achieving its goal, so that it could provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price. Earlier this month, the company won a modification contract, worth 5.6 billion, to offer LRIP of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter. Again, it won a modification contract, worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Interestingly, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Additionally, the government might place larger orders.

1958,LMT,"General Dynamics Corp.'s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently announced that it has been awarded a modification contract to redesign the main propulsion machinery (MPM) control systems of Virginia Class from the U.S. Navy.Contract DetailsValued at $40.7 million, the contract requires Electric Boat to undertake necessary planning and execution efforts and will procure long lead time material which will be capable of replacing the MPM control systems or the main propulsion unit along with the ship service turbine generator set.All work related to the deal will be carried out at the company’s Sunnyvale, CA facility. Electric Boat expects the work to be completed by May, 2020. At the time of the award, the company will be obligated with $20.3 million funds.Earlier this month, the company secured another modification contract worth $115 million. Per the agreement, the company will provide additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines. (Read More: General Dynamics Wins $115M Virginia-class Submarine Deal)About Virginia-class submarinesVirginia-class submarines are nuclear powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) which serves the U.S. Navy. These submarines are the result of joint efforts by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Each of these submarines is valued around $2.7 billion and is expected to be operational until 2070.Why General Dynamics?General Dynamics is one of the two companies across the globe, equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. Therefore, the company enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.The U.S. Navy has plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years which will come with an additional mid-body section called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).The Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests of approximately $97.9 million for the research and development funding of the VPM. This indicates a possibility of additional defense contracts for General Dynamics.The Navy has also said that the Virginia-class submarines are one of its top priorities. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the one of the prime contractor for Virginia-class submarines.What’s in Store for Defense SpaceThe proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and others. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants.Price MovementShares of General Dynamic have returned 30.6% in the last one year compared to the industry’s return of 33.1% in the same time period.High competition from peers and declining backlogs are some of the major concerns for the company that affects its price performance.Zacks RanksGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1959,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Aeronautics, has won a contract to offer supplies and services for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.Contract DetailsThe contract, which is valued at $53.5 million, has been awarded by Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide milestone event capabilities, including retrofit modification kits and installation services for the Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy as well as non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants.The modification includes 50% of the work for the Marine Corps, 21% for the Air Force, 18% for the Navy and 11% for non-DoD participants.Work is scheduled to be completed by July 2021 and September 2025 for DoD customers and non-DoD participants, respectively. It will be performed in Fort Worth, TX, and will use fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Marine Corps and Air Force), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy) and non-DoD participants’ funds.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors.Notably, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Moreover, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump on being an overtly expensive project.In this context, Lockheed Martin finally inked an $8.5 billion deal with Pentagon this February. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to maintain management’s earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6–7%.Going forward, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next couple of years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable Lockheed Martin to take a step toward achieving its goal, so that it could provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price. In August, the company won a modification contract, worth 5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter. Again, it won a modification contract, worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Interestingly, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Additionally, the government might place larger orders. This, in turn, will boost the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up 17.7% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 33.1%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In second quarter 2017, Raytheon reported earnings of $1.98 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 13.8%. The long-term earnings growth of the company is presently pegged at 9.67%.Raytheon offers wide range of combat-proven defense products to its customers and continues to receive orders from all verticals of the U.S. Defense as well as allies of the country. The company secured new booking of $6.5 billion in second quarter and exited the quarter with a backlog of $36.2 billion.Foreign military contracts continue to be vital growth driver for Raytheon. Rise in radical terrorism has led to growing demand from the Gulf countries and Asia-Pacific regions which are also expected to boost revenues in the time to come. The company is not just dependent on domestic orders with 42% of its current backlog coming from international customers.Raytheon recently entered a joint venture with the Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), named Javelin. Per this contract, both companies will work on procuring Javelin containerized all-up rounds, command launch units, Javelin vehicle launcher-electronics and associated non-recurring engineering.The rising tension between the United States and the North Korea could further increase the importance of Raytheon's Patriot Air and Missile Defense System.

1962,LMT,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) announced that it has finally reached a definitive agreement with United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report). Per the deal, the former will be acquired by the latter for a total transaction value of $30 billion. The deal is projected to wrap up by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.United Technologies had submitted an offer to acquire Rockwell Collins on Aug 4.Purchase ConsiderationPer the terms of the deal, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share, in cash as well as its common stock. Each shareowner of the Rockwell Collins will get $93.33 per share in cash and $46.67 in shares of its common stock, depending on a 7.5% collar as of Aug 22, 2017 closing share price of $115.69.United Technologies expects to fund the cash part of the transaction through debt issuances and cash in hand. The company is also dedicated to take necessary steps to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings.The total transaction value of $30 billion reflects the total equity value of $23 billion and the balance includes Rockwell Collins’ net debt. This purchase consideration is higher than the $20 billion value estimated last week when both the companies were engaged in talks before signing the deal. (Read more: Rockwell Collins Nears $20B Deal with United Technologies)Post Acquisition ScenarioUnited Technologies expects the acquisition to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share after the first full year, following the deal’s closure. The takeover is estimated to generate more than $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year.On completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ Aerospace Systems will be integrated to form a new business unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.Benefits of the AcquisitionWith the acquisition, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation. In fact, the deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.On completion of the deal, United Technologies will burgeon to a $93 billion group as a more critical supplier of components to aircraft companies such as The Boeing co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). Thus with the acquisition, a new aircraft bellwether will emerge, claiming a significant position in the aerospace-defense space.Post acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, based on anticipated results.Our ViewThe takeover will create a new giant in the space for aircraft parts makers. It is expected to emerge as the world’s fourth largest aerospace firm by revenue after Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report). The move is intended to counter aircraft stalwarts like Boeing and Airbus, which are aiming to capture major portion of the profits earned by their suppliers. Both the aerospace biggies are putting pressure on suppliers to lower the prices and are moving into the high-margin aftermarket arena for parts and services. To this end, in July, Boeing had threatened Rockwell Collins with the warning that it will build up its own avionics business.Notably, United Technologies will gain a strong negotiating status with the consolidation of Rockwell Collins as it will be able to manufacture as many as components required on each aircraft.Price PerformanceRockwell Collins has outperformed the broader industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have soared 53.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 26.1% in the same period.The outperformance may have been driven by the fact that Rockwell Collins continues to be the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers.Zacks RankRockwell Collins currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1963,LMT,"On Sunday, North Korea raised global geopolitical tensions after it claimed it had conducted a sixth and substantially more powerful nuclear test. This announcement also significantly increased pressure on the Trump administration, representing the most serious foreign affairs crisis in years.Much of this depends on how the United States ultimately responds to this latest provocation from North Korea. However, initial reactions suggest that policymakers are still weighing their options and are likely to issue a studied and measured response.This is why the impact of this event on the U.S. bourses will largely be limited to the short term. At the same time, a flight toward safe haven assets and another surge in popularity of defense stocks is likely as developments surrounding North Korea continue to unfold.Mattis Issues Stern WarningOn Sep 3, North Korea claimed that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being fitted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). In a televised statement, the country claimed that the test was a “perfect success” and guaranteed that North Korea now possessed a credible nuclear warhead.Reacting to the test, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis issued a stern warning to North Korea. Mattis said the errant country would have to face a tremendous military response if it indulged in an act of aggression against the United States or its allies.Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has hinted that it will explore further steps to isolate North Korea’s economy following its recent actions, especially with regard to testing of missiles and nuclear weapons. Future attempts to curb the country economically could include increasing pressure on China to stop its oil imports to North Korea, a move which could cripple the country in several ways.Defense Stocks to Gain Apart from economic sanctions, the prospects of U.S. military action against North Korea have also increased following Mattis’ strong response to the nuclear test. Given such a backdrop, U.S. defense stocks are likely to mop up considerable gains in the days ahead. Reports from South Korea hinting at further missile tests by its Northern neighbor, including an ICBM launch, are likely to provide further impetus to this sector.This in keeping with gains enjoyed by defense stocks in the aftermath of last week’s missile launch over Japan. On Aug 29, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing into the sea. Following this event, stocks such as Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) moved north. Each of these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Popularity of Safe Haven Assets to RiseMeanwhile, South Korea carried out live-fire drills, intended to exhibit the country’s military strength, as a response to the nuclear test. Additionally, it is speeding up the deployment of the U.S. manufactured THAAD missile defense system. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the popularity of safe haven assets is on the rise.Since Sunday’s test, treasuries, gold, the yen and the Swiss franc have all found favor with investors. But such a state of affairs is unlikely to last beyond a point. In the past, investors have participated in a short term selloff and rushed toward safe haven assets in the aftermath of such an event. Subsequently, they have bought the dip soon after receiving indications that tensions have eased or are unlikely to escalate further.In ConclusionNorth Korea’s latest nuclear test is likely to add to U.S. investors’ woes in the week ahead. But this set to be a short term phenomenon, given that U.S. military action in the region still seems unlikely. Given such prospects, markets are likely to focus on strong economic fundamentals and bullish earnings performance of stocks. This means that a major stock slide, even in the midterm, seems unlikely. Stocks are likely to return to their winning ways once tensions begin to recede.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1964,LMT,"The recent altercation between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent the major defense stocks rallying. Notably, Trump cautioned North Korea that if it does not refrain from repeated missiles threats, the U.S. will respond with “fire and fury.”In retaliation, Kim threatened to fire missiles on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses military bases. While the rest of the broader market reacted negatively to the escalated geopolitical tensions, defense stocks picked up pace.But it is imperative to mention that this tension between the U.S. and North Korea has not been the only driving force behind the defense stocks’ rally. In fact, the space has been a big market winner for quite some time now, on the back of Trump’s presidential win and a few other factors.However, major indices for the Aerospace sector ended up in the red in the trailing five trading sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index lost 0.8%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index declined 0.9% during this period.

The aeronautics segment of the company is engaged in designing, research and development, systems integration, production and support of advanced military aircraft and related technologies. This segment is busy with major programs comprising F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and C-5M Super Galaxy.  It generated revenues of $5.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting 40.9% of the total revenue.Our ViewThe proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and others. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. This easily surpassed the nation’s current spending caps, which, enacted in 2011, limited annual military spending to $549 billion. It even exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost this defense prime’s business growth.Additionally, regular contracts from the different verticals of the U.S. Defense, has enabled Lockheed Martin to become a strong cash generator. This has aided the company to take important cash deployment decisions. For the second quarter of 2017, the company generated cash from operations worth $1.54 billion, up 4.8% year over year.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have returned 13.6% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 16.7% in the same time frame.Too much dependence on F-35 program and intense competition might hurt the company’s growth trajectory.Zacks RanksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1967,LMT,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit secured a modification contract for Trident II (D5) missile deployed system support. Work related to this deal is expected to be completed by Sep 30.Valued at $21.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, majority of the work will be executed in Sunnyvale, CA; Cape Canaveral, FL and the rest at different other parts of the U.S.Fiscal 2017 weapons procurement (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the work.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems Co. is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.In Sep 2016, the Navy launched an unarmed Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, following which the company announced that it is building on a 60-year partnership with the Navy. The declaration was made to ensure that the missile system remains capable for decades ahead through the company’s shared robust flight test plan.The latest contract is expected to boost the company’s business substantially.  Given that Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, the company remains confident of winning more of such contracts in the near term.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 19.8% in the last one year, underperforming the 34.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be attributed to the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report). Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1968,LMT,"Shares of several companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Lockheed Martin, climbed to new all-time highs on Wednesday, as tensions between North Korea, the U.S., and the United Nations continue to escalate.The growing conflict between the U.S. and North Korea sent many markets around the world down on Tuesday and Wednesday. One of the biggest reasons for the decline is a new heightened war of words between President Donald Trump and Pyongyang representatives, which stem from UN Security Council economic sanctions that were imposed unanimously on North Korea over the weekend—the sanctions will reportedly cut off $1 billion from the nation’s annual foreign revenue.Since then, an aggressive back and forth has occurred between the U.S. president and the North Korean capital. On Tuesday, President Trump warned North Korea against continuing its threats, or testing missiles, saying the U.S. would respond with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”Pyongyang then responded that it would consider using missiles against Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses U.S. military bases.Wasting little time, President Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning to boast about the renewed strength of America’s nuclear arsenal.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017On the back of these escalating tensions and provocations, U.S. defense-based stocks saw gains on Wednesday morning.Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) jumped 1.18% in morning trading to reach a new all-time intraday trading high of $303.92 a share. Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) also saw its stock price hit an all-time high in morning trading on Wednesday after it climbed 2.29% to $178.80 per share.Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rose 1.32% to $273.42 a share, which marked a new all-time high water mark for the company.

1969,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a contract for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 2024.Details of the DealValued at $409 million, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.In fact, this deal is a joint effort of multiple government agencies and industry to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies. Through this contract, applied research will also be conducted for enhancing knowledge and understanding of future power, thermal and controls requirements.Work will be carried out at Hazelwood, MI, using fiscal 2017 research and development funds.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.In June, Boeing secured a modification to a foreign military sales contract worth $410.9 million from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the original contract, it will provide 38 Apache aircraft, three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares to the U.K. government.Again, the company’s unit secured a contract, valued at $475 million, to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services in support of the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems program, at multiple locations across the globe. Going forward, we expect these contracts to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Considering the favorable budgetary scenario now, we expect such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, to help Boeing achieve its desired business expansion in the near term.Interestingly, Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense big shots like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, these stocks saw a notable rise after Trump presented his “America First” budget.Additionally, an increase in fund flow from the Pentagon raised optimism. Hence, we expect these factors to enable Boeing in winning more such scrumptious orders in the days ahead.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 79.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.6%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1970,LMT,"Wall Street witnessed a decent rally of the defense stocks at the onset of this week owing to North Korea’s missile launch that flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea. North Korea’s President justified the move as an action to counter the United States and South Korean military drills. In retaliation, South Korea dropped bombs on Korean peninsula.Notably, this event once again led to fresh altercations between the United States and North Korea. Defense stocks have been on growth trajectory since the beginning of the last month due to Trump’s “fire and fury” response against North Korea’s move.

1973,LMT,"Javelin, a joint venture (JV) formed by defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), recently won a modification contract for procuring Javelin containerized all-up rounds, command launch units, Javelin vehicle launcher-electronics and associated non-recurring engineering. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 31, 2020.Valued at $133.9 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The deal falls under the foreign military sales (FMS) program of the United States and will aid nations like Jordan, Qatar and Taiwan.Work will be carried out in Tuscon, AZ. The project will use other procurement funds of fiscal 2017.A Brief Note on JavelinJavelin is the world's first one-man-portable, fire-and-forget, multipurpose missile system. This compact, lightweight missile was designed for one-soldier operations in all situations. It enhances direct-fire capability against armored vehicles, buildings and field fortifications. Armed forces all over the world have adopted Javelin. In fact, it is currently serving the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as well as 15 allied militaries.Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been producing the Javelin handheld missile system through the JV since as early as the mid-1990s. Impressively, this combat proven weapon system boasts a reliability rate of more than 94%.Our ViewWhile, Raytheon is one of the best-positioned large-cap defense players in the United States, Lockheed Martin is the nation’s largest defense contractor. FMS contracts is a vital growth driver for both the defense majors.Notably, both Raytheon and Lockheed Martin are two of the three major contractors involved in the $110 billion arms deal that President Trump signed in May, with Saudi Arabia.Going ahead, Raytheon continues to see significant overseas demand for early warning radars, as well as for TPY-2 X-Band radars between 2018 and2020. To meet this demand, Raytheon is upgrading its radar systems. On the other hand, the U.S. administration in March announced plans to pursue the $5 billion sale of 19 F-16 jets to Bahrain– a deal which got stalled owing to human rights concerns last year. On approval, the Bahrain deal will benefit Lockheed Martin substantially.Therefore, it is evident that both the companies enjoy substantial demand for their weaponries in the foreign market and given the rising geopolitical conflicts worldwide, demand is likely to escalate in the days ahead. The latest contract is reflective of the rise in demand, which willdrivegrowth for the likes of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 19.8% in the last one year, underperforming the 34.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might be attributed to the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticisedfor being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).On the other hand, Raytheon’s stock has returned 24.9% in the last one year, outperforming the 24.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.This might have been driven by its wide range of combat-proven defense products, on account of which the company continues to receive scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the nation. Zacks RankBoth Raytheon and Lockheed Martin currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1974,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), has won a modification contract to support production requirement of a Hellfire II missile.Contract DetailsValued at $547.9 million, the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command Redstone Arsenal, AL.Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide support to 7,358 Hellfire II tactical missiles in containers, in various air-to ground missiles models.Work is scheduled to be completed by Sep 30, 2020 and will be performed in Orlando, FL. The contract will use fiscal 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2017 other procurement (Army) funds.Hellfire II AttributesHellfire II is an upgraded version of the Longbow Hellfire missiles. It is designed to respond to ground and naval threats. Also, it incorporates a semi-active laser guidance system, which gives them a precision, man-in-the-loop capability.These missiles are available in two versions – High Explosive Anti-Tank for anti-armor requirements, and the Blast Fragmentation for naval targets, buildings and bunkers.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s MFC business unit derives a major portion of its revenue from its air and missile defense product line. In the second quarter of 2017, this segment generated sales of $1.6 billion, which represented almost 13% of the company’s total sales.In fact, the company claims to be the world leader in missile defense with its systems having achieved more than 100 successful intercepts in combat and flight testing since 1984 and 50 successful target missions since 1996.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Moreover, the budget proposal of $13.5 billion in addition to $25 billion that came from President Trump for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year has been allocated for a number of defense equipments.  We believe that if this proposal is accepted it will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s revenue growth.Considering the aforementioned developments, the company is expected to win more of such contracts in days ahead, given that most of its programs are the top priorities in the Pentagon’s missile system.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 21.8% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.3%. This could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally. Furthermore, the stock’s performance lags compared with that of The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) and Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report), which surpassed the industry mark.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1975,LMT,"The U.S. aerospace and defense stocks have seen significant upward trends so far this year, primarily on the back of increasing geopolitical uncertainties worldwide. While a number of industry bellwethers posted encouraging results, the Aerospace sector also reaped the benefits. This impressive performance is anticipated to continue for the remaining half of the year as well, driven by the same factors which stoked the sector’s robust growth year to date.Sector Behemoths Impress in Q2Many sector behemoths have gained significantly year to date and posted improved earnings during the second quarter. In the Aerospace and Defense space, 90% of the stocks topped earnings and 70% exceeded revenue expectations, in the quarter. Undoubtedly, such bullish releases make us optimistic about the sector’s improved performance as we move into the reporting cycle for second half of the year. Below we have mentioned second-quarter earnings releases from a handful of the defense biggies:Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenues with both surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2% and 1.8%, respectively.Additionally, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) reported upbeat second-quarter 2017 results with revenues and earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Earnings and revenues of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate during the second quarter by 13.8% and 0.9%, respectively.Factors Favoring the Defense SectorCurrently, geo-political tensions, international terrorist acts threatening the security of nations and intra-national conflicts are on the rise. This in turn is leading to many civil wars, thus creating a lucrative growth opportunity for defense contractors.Again, factors like a growing international market for weaponries with many developing nations expanding their defense spending, the advent of innovative technologies in warfare and their increasing application as well as increased demand for cost-efficient production are driving revenue growth in the U.S. Aerospace & Defense space.In particular, a notable increase in the U.S. defense budget under President Trump has bolstered investors’ optimism on this industry’s ascension. In this regard, the U.S. House passed the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion on Jul 14 that extensively surpassed Trump’s earlier budget request.In addition to catering to a large domestic market, the U.S. defense majors are expanding their foreign markets rapidly, taking advantage of regional tensions prevailing in the Middle East. Rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India are also boosting these stocks’ prospect.Toward this end, it is to be noted that foreign military sales play a vital role in the growth story of U.S. defense stocks. The arms deal worth $110 billion signed by Trump with Saudi Arabia this May is reflective of this. Notably, this deal has the potential to touch $350 billion over 10 years.Other elements driving this sector include Trump’s defense strategy apart from the budgetary amendments. To this end, Trump's speech involving enhanced military spending in Afghanistan moved the defense stocks to a higher trajectory. Furthermore, the ongoing altercation between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on the terms of frequent missile testing from the both the nations, sent the major defense stocks rallying.Zacks Industry RankWe have 265 industries in our Zacks Coverage Universe, which we put into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).

However, the revenue performance was a mixed bag (read: Aerospace and Defense ETFs Soar on U.S-Saudi Deal).Given the escalating geopolitical risks involving Syria and North Korea, demand for defense products is increasing. Moreover, airlines have been spending aggressively on renewals of their fleet worldwide. These factors are a positive for this industry and make investments in this sector an attractive option (read: ETFs to Top/Flop as Trump Lays Foundation for Future America).Earnings in FocusBoeing Company reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 and increasing from last year’s loss of $0.44 per share.

1983,LMT,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., has secured a contract to offer logistics support services for government-owned fixed wing fleet performing special electronic mission aircraft missions.Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $116.9 million, has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2027, and will be performed in Herndon, VA. The deal will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Army) funds.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. In addition, this Falls Church, VA-based company continues to witness strong demand for its unmanned air systems on a global scale.Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, the outlook for various stocks in this space has improved manifold in the past months on the back of enhanced spending promises that Trump had made in his latest America First budget.Specifically, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal reflected an annual increase of approximately $2.2 billion more than the year-ago budget. Again, the Trump administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations included an additional base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase more than the current base budget level, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense.Also, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill recently, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March.If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost business growth of all the defense giants including Northrop Grumman. A moderate flow of funds from the Pentagon further added to the optimism.Going forward, we expect the increased spending to be allocated to certain key areas that might unlock higher opportunities for Northrop Grumman.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has rallied 27.6% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 39.9%. The downturn was owing to higher operating expenses that continue to partially impact the company’s profit margin. Also, Northrop Grumman may be challenged by economic and political factors. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which is a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1984,LMT,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has secured a contract for the replacement of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by 2022.Valued at $900 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Air Delivered Capabilities Directorate, Eglin Air Force Base, FL. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will conduct technology maturation and risk reduction acquisition phase for the Long Range Standoff weapon (LRSO) — a next-generation cruise missile. Work will be carried out in Orlando, FL.Apart from Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Air Force has also awarded a similar contract worth $900 million to defense major Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report).A Brief Note on AGM-86BAerospace giant The Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile is long-range subsonic, 3,200-pound self-guided missile carried by a B-52 bomber at high and low altitudes. Armed with a nuclear warhead, it is a well-known American subsonic air-launched cruise missile (ALCM).The missile electronically “sees” the terrain over which it flies and can travel more than 1,500 miles to hit the target. Owing to its long range, the missile can be launched far from hostile territory and still reach its target.Our ViewThere has been a rapid rise in terrorist activities across the globe of late. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.With this aim in view, for last few years the U.S. Air Force has been planning to introduce the LRSO to strengthen its strategic bomber fleet further. In July 2016, the Air Force released a request for proposals of development for its LRSO nuclear cruise missile program, with up to two contract awards expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.The proposal was to replace the aging AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, with the weapon facing increasing sustainment and operational challenges against evolving threats. We believe the recently won contract by Lockheed Martin is in sync with this proposal.Notably, Lockheed Martin boasts decades’ experience in missile systems. Its varied defense product portfolio includes the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) —a long range, conventional air-to-ground, precision-guided standoff missile, along with tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems.With the global missiles and missile defense system market projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18% during 2017-2024, to reach a value of $41 billion, we can expect the company to win more such missile contracts in the days ahead. This in turn will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s growth trajectory in the aerospace and defense space.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 22% in the last one year, underperforming the 37.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1985,LMT,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $33.1 million contract from the U.S. Navy for Firepower Enhancement Program (FEP), System Technical Support.Details of the DealThe work related to the contract will be carried out at the company’s McKinney, TX facility. Additional funding related to the award will be obligated along with future delivery orders.The order has been awarded with an initial five-year ordering period ranging from Aug 20, 2017 to Aug 20, 2022. It also comes with one option consisting of a five-year ordering period from Aug 21, 2022 through Aug 20, 2027. The entire work order is expected to be completed by Aug, 2027.According to the Department of Defense, the development of FEP was aimed at implementing a second generation forward looking infrared that could detect and identify ranges under different battlefield conditions along with a far target location capability.Why Raytheon?Raytheon is one of the best-positioned large-cap defense players due to its non-platform-centric focus.  The company has been heavily investing in technological upgrades. In this context, Raytheon has been witnessing strong upside in its GaN–based naval radars. The company’s next-generation solutions include the air and missile defense radar (AMDR) and the enterprise air surveillance radar, which enable it to support the U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats.Defense ScenarioWith rising threats from North Korea along with expanding global terrorism, it has become extremely important for the United States to keep its defense weaponries updated.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants including Raytheon, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and many others.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of Raytheon have gained 15.1% compared to the industry’s gain of 13.1% in the same period of time.Foreign military contracts continue to be the vital growth driver for Raytheon. Rising demand from the Gulf countries and Asia-Pacific will also boost revenues.Zacks RankRaytheon currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1986,LMT,"Aerospace giant The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a modification contract for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (RSLFAC).  Details of the DealValued at $222.5 million, the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command Redstone Arsenal, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 30, 2021 and will be carried out in Ridley Township, PA. The contract will use fiscal 2017 foreign military sales funds.A Brief Note on CH-47 ChinookBoeing’s CH-47 Chinook is an American twin-engine, tandem rotor, heavy-lift helicopter. Its speed of 170 knots is faster than other existing utility and attack helicopters. Its main functions include troop movement, artillery emplacement and battlefield resupply. The U.S. Army has been using Boeing’s Chinook since 1962.Currently, the CH-47F/MH-47G modernization program is in full-rate production. This, in turn, will ensure that the American twin-engine remains in the U.S. Army at least through the 2030s. Particularly, Boeing is trying to keep pace with a slew of helicopter demand in domestic and international markets.Meanwhile, the demand for this helicopter is on the rise, internationally as well as domestically. Last month, Boeing received a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contract worth nearly $14.3 million to supply new parts of CH-47F Chinook helicopters to the Netherlands and Turkey.Earlier in May 2017, Boeing had won another FMS contract valued at $541.1 million from the Netherlands to build 15 CH-47F cargo helicopters. Notably, Chinook helicopters are utilized by the Netherlands government for both defense and humanitarian purposes.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Markedly, the FMS contracts supported the large US-based defense companies when there was a marginal drop in domestic orders.  Evidently, in November 2016, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced FMS of $33.6 billion for the fiscal year.Again, in May 2017, President Trump signed a $110 billion defense package with Saudi Arabia, which will span over seven decades. This deal surpassed the $38 billion US-Israel defense pact that was inked in September 2016 for 10 years. We believe the recently signed contract forms a part of this arms deal worth $110 billion.Thanks to the nation’s wide range of product offerings, because of which Boeing and other U.S. defense operators continue to receive defense contracts from the allied countries.To this end, in a recent development, the United States has agreed to sell its Patriot missile defense system to Poland, which will benefit manufacturer Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). The potential value of the deal could reach around $8 billion.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 78.6% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 37.1%. This might have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. In addition, the company poses strong competition to its peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1987,LMT,"After the North Korea issue, geopolitical risks heightened again, with Trump's Afghanistan speech. President Donald Trump recently commented that as many as 4,000 more U.S. troops will be employed to handle Afghanistan’s terror issue and that he will launch a political arrangement with the Taliban. The President also said that a quick removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan may once again attract terrorists to fill that gap.As per an article published on Bloomberg, the comments mark a shift from Trump’s presidential campaign. During the campaign, Trump only approved the necessity of U.S. interference in Afghanistan’s terrorism issue. In fact, he hinted at the more crucial need for abandoning military engagement in that region and deploying resources rather at the domestic land.At the start of the month, Donald Trump pledged that North Korean premier Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear threats will be met with “fire and fury.” Increasing tensions between the two regions — the U.S. and North Korea and recent comments about Afghanistan have pushed up defense and aerospace stocks (read: ETFs to Profit from US-North Korea Tensions).Moreover, the earnings season has also been quite impressive for companies in this sector.

1988,LMT,"President Trump revealed a reversal of strategy in Afghanistan, promising to “fight to win” instead of withdrawing entirely. He vowed to ramp up U.S. engagement in Afghanistan, the country’s longest war to date. He added that moving troops away from Afghanistan would create a “vacuum”, which terrorists would “instantly fill”. But, he refrained from revealing specific troop numbers or measures of success.Defense stocks moved north on Trump’s Afghanistan speech, while such stocks have nearly doubled the S&P 500’s performance since his election victory. His commitment to swiftly increase military spending boded well for defense stocks. This calls for investing in such stocks for solid gains.Trump Announces More War in AfghanistanIn a much awaited speech, Trump announced that he won’t pull out troops from Afghanistan and is committed to a plan at winning the nation’s longest war, which is now in its 17th year. In other words, he is introducing a dramatic, new offensive in Afghanistan, which will integrate diplomatic, economic and military power. But, Trump refrained from divulging details on troop deployments or specific dates of operations for security reasons. He did acknowledge that his “original instinct was to pull out”, which was once an important campaign pledge before he became the President.Trump mentioned that the war will crush al Qaeda and prevent Taliban from taking over Afghanistan. He will urge NATO forces to join hands and support his new strategy. He also said that Pakistan is a terrorist hotbed and has harbored militants. Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network has found safe haven in Pakistan for the launch of multiple attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. He warned Islamabad of consequences if its government doesn’t take sweeping steps to eradicate such terrorist organizations. He stressed that Pakistan needs to have stronger ties with India in war against terrorists.Finally, he concluded that “terrorists take heed. America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat. Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense. In every generation we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed”.Big Money for Defense Contractors Tied to James MattisGeneral Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) stands to gain handsomely from Trump’s Afghanistan “surge’’. And why so? Prior to joining the Trump administration, Defense Secretary James Mattis was an “independent director” of the multinational defense contracting behemoth. He was paid $594,369 by the company between 2013 and 2016.It was during that time, the company boasted of receiving a $216 million order from the U.S. Army to build a “Warfighter Information Network” system. It was immensely successful in serving the army in Afghanistan. The company also received multi-million dollar payments for providing soldiers in Afghanistan items like Foxhound vehicles to IT management services.And now with Mattis holding a far more operational role, it can be expected that General Dynamics will benefit more from the Afghan war. Mattis now looks into more lucrative Pentagon contracts, which are positioned to even get more lucrative in the light of Trump’s declaration to deploy more troops in Afghanistan.Defense Stocks Rise on Trump’s SpeechDefense stocks rose broadly following Trump’s remarks, with the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) rising 1.2% on Aug 22. Major defense stocks like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) gained 1.9%, 0.9% and 1.7%, respectively. Northrop and Boeing were also awarded contracts for intercontinental ballistic missile system replacements.In fact, Trump’s pledge to significantly increase federal spending related to national security was cheered by Republicans and has helped defense and aerospace stocks scale higher. He had promised to seek a $54-billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems. The defense budget will climb 10%, according to the White House, while Trump recommended $30 billion in supplementary military spending for this year (read more: 5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Promises to Spend Big on Defense).5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy NowAs Trump’s Afghanistan strategy gives defense stocks a boost, investing in the same seems a prudent choice.

1989,LMT,"We issued an updated research report on Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) on Aug 22. This renowned military shipbuilder is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S.In particular, the shipbuilding business outlook has improved post the fiscal 2017 proposal, along with the additional appropriations bill put forward by President Trump this year. In particular, an Omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal 2017 has been finalized and is expected to benefit the product lines of the company’s Ingalls segment. Per management, this bill will fund Huntington Ingalls’ LPD 29 and long lead material for NSC 10 fully.The company also continues to introduce ships with enhanced capabilities. Among recent updates, Huntington Ingalls launched LHA 7 America-class amphibious assault ship in May. It further conducted successful builders’ trials on LPD 27 Portland at the end of June. The company plans to complete acceptance trials and deliver the ship to the Navy by the end of the year.Moreover, Huntington Ingalls maintains stable liquidity and capital resources to fund its operations. The company’s net cash from operating activities at the end of second quarter of 2017 was $284 million, up from the year ago quarter’s figure of $223 million.Further, the company focuses on maximizing shareholder value, through share repurchases and increased dividend payouts. During the first six months of 2017, Huntington Ingalls paid $55 million worth of dividend, up from $48 million a year ago.On the flip side, Huntington Ingalls' Newport News, which occupies the majority of the company’s business, has been underperforming for past couple of quarters. In recent times, Huntington Ingalls have been witnessing consistent volume and margin pressure in this segment.Moreover, Huntington Ingalls faces intense competition from other defense majors in the market like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Further, shares of the company underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last one year.

1990,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a modification contract to support sustainment of C-17 aircraft due to increase in fleet and number operating bases.Details of the DealValued at $7.1 billion, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, C-17 Contracting Branch, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2021 and will be carried out across the globe.A Brief Note on C-17Boeing’s C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft. The multi-service C-17 can carry large equipment, supplies troops directly to small airfields in harsh terrain anywhere in the world.In addition, it can take off from a 7,600-ft. airfield, carry a payload of 160,000 pounds, fly 2,400 nautical miles, re-fuel in flight and land in 3,000 feet or less on a small unpaved or paved airfield in day or night. Also, it can perform tactical airlift, medical evacuation and airdrop missions.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.For example, it recently clinched a contract worth $409 million, for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program. This deal forms part of a joint effort of multiple government agencies and industry to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies. Moreover, through it applied research will be conducted for enhancing knowledge and understanding of future power, thermal and controls requirements.Again, in June, Boeing secured a modification to a foreign military sales contract worth $410.9 million from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the original contract, it will provide 38 Apache aircraft, three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares to the U.K. government. Going forward, we expect such contracts, including the recent one, to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense big shots like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, these stocks saw a notable rise after Trump presented his “America First” budget.Considering the current favorable budgetary scenario, we anticipate that such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, will help Boeing to achieve its desired business expansion in the near term. Additionally, an increase in fund flow from the Pentagon has raised investor’s optimism in the stock.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 76.4% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.7%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1992,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) business unit has won a contract for the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) requirement. The deal has been awarded by U.S. Special Operations Command Contracting office, Tampa, FL.The $8 billion contract will enable Lockheed Martin to offer non-personal, global logistics support services along with the expertise to maintain program support. The deal will also help to maintain Enterprise management functions for the Program Executive Office of the Special Operations Forces Support Activity.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Bluegrass Station, Lexington, KY, Bluegrass Army Depot, Richmond, KY, Fort Walton Beach, FL, and Crestview, FL, as well as multiple customer locations both inside and outside the continental U.S. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to finance the proceeds of the contract.A Brief Note on SOF GLSSThe SOF GLSS deal is U.S. Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM) largest service contract vehicle providing a wide range of tailored logistics, maintenance and sustainment services. The Program Executive Office of the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (PEO SOFSA) oversees the contract and, under its direction, Lockheed Martin conducts its day-to-day operations, providing the full range of logistics services required to support the SOF community.Together, PEO SOFSA and Lockheed Martin provide one-stop service for agile, innovative, on-demand depot-like services to SOCOM components and other U.S. Government entities that support SOCOM’s missions worldwide.In 2016 the company submitted a bid for SOF GLSS contract, a competitive follow-on agreement to SOF CLSS and expected to receive an award decision on the same in mid-2017. The recently won deal seems to be in line with Lockheed Martin’s expectation.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s MFC business unit is well-known for offering air and missile defense systems along with fire control systems, mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services. In the second quarter of 2017, the MFC business segment generated sales of $1.6 billion, which represented 12.6% of Lockheed Martin’s total sales.Going ahead, the company expects MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We believe the aforementioned contract will surely aid the company in achieving this target.  Moreover, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense space in the U.S. Also, $13.5 billion of the additional $25 billion budget proposal that came from President Trump for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal, has been allocated for a number of top-rated defense equipments including those of Lockheed Martin’s.  This in turn, if accepted, will boost Lockheed Martin’s revenues growth.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 14% in the last one year, underperforming the 31.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticized for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1994,LMT,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, clinched a modification contract for providing electronic warfare equipment to support Virginia-class submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by April 2020.Details of the DealValued at $71.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. Majority of the work will be executed in Syracuse, NY and Fairfax, VA; while the rest will be performed in Germantown, MD; Van Nuys, CA and Buffalo, NY.The contract will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion, fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion, fiscal 2017 other procurement and fiscal 2016 other procurement funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class Submarines The Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs), designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions. These are being jointly constructed by military shipbuilders General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these ships will be operational until 2070.What’s Electronic Warfare?Electronic Warfare (EW) represents the ability to use the electromagnetic spectrum-signals such as radio, infrared or radar — to sense, protect, and communicate. Being one of the top-graded defense contractors in the world, Lockheed Martin manufacturers advanced EW technologies that have the ability to control the electromagnetic spectrum.  The company also develops disruptive technologies to combat adversary threats.For the U.S. Navy, Lockheed Martin offers a handful of next-generation EW systems like the Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (AOEW), Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) and MK234 Nulka Off board Countermeasure System. By incorporating these new age warfare systems, the Navy fleets can detect incoming threats and effectively respond to them.Our ViewThe U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. Currently, the Navy plans to procure two Virginia-class submarines in fiscal 2018, for a total investment worth $5.5 billion. The move will boost the ship’s manufacturers — General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls — along with Lockheed Martin, the EW of which will be installed in these ships. We believe the recent modification contract is a notable step toward the fulfillment of the plan.Moreover, the fiscal 2017 defense budget strongly emphasized on enhancing the nation’s EW capabilities along with other defensive abilities. In particular, the budget included an investment of $1.2 billion for upgrading the U.S. fleets by spending more on development including for that of EW.  This raises hope for increased demand for Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven EW systems, which in turn will boost its revenues.Lockheed Martin’s EW serves the U.S., Australian and Canadian Navy. Going ahead, the global EW market is expected to reach a value worth $25.36 billion by 2021 and with Lockheed Martin being a dominating player in the space, the stock is poised to grow.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up 26.5% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 39.5%.This could be of the present defense budget which is in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks Rank & Key PickLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report), which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1995,LMT,"Following fresh tensions over North Korea’s fanatic militant activities, this time targeting Japan, majority of the U.S. defense stocks moved north on Aug 30. Notably, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea.This sudden move made investors skeptical owing to which major world market indices, at the onset of Aug 29 trading session, dipped. However, by the end of the day, the U.S. stocks regained their footing.The S&P 500 ended the session by inching up 0.1%, while both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%. Though investors were initially unnerved by the mounting tension due to the missile launch and Hurricane Harvey’s devastation, the day eventually closed on a promising note. U.S. administration’s aggressive defense strategy probably saved the day for the stocks.How Did North Korea Justify?North Korea’s President Kim Jong-Un justified the move as an action to counter the United States and South Korean military drills. Per major media sources, Kim maintained that the missile launch was his first step of conducting military operations in the Pacific and more such actions can be expected, going forward.Moreover, North Korea's official news agency KCNA claimed that the move marks the anniversary of the disputed Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula.South Korea and U.S. RetaliatesA high alert has been issued in Japan following North Korea’s missile launch. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strongly condemned the action as a “reckless act” and a grave threat to the country’s security. He also reminded North Korea of the U.S.’ cordial relationship with Japan. In response, a few hours after the attack on Japan, South Korea dropped bombs at the Taebaek Pilsung Firing Range in North Korea’s Gangwon province. Through this South Korea exhibited its military strength to dent the opposition’s confidence when needed.Further, North Korea’s missile attack on Japan, was severely criticized by the U.S. President Trump. He sent a strong message to his Korean counterpart, saying “all options are on the table"" indicating a possible counter missile launch in the near term.Stocks in FocusCross-border tensions between the United States and North Korea have escalated manifold in the last few months.

1996,LMT,"Aerospace behemoth The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) secured a $349.2 million contract for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 20, 2020.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Per the terms of the agreement, Boeing will deliver an affordable total system replacement of Minuteman III missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. The replacement will be done by conducting technology maturation and reducing technical risk of this weapon system. Work will be carried out in Huntsville, Al, and various other locations. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds to finish the work.A Short Note on GBSD & MinutemanGround Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) is the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the U.S. Air Force. Boeing’s Minuteman is one such ICBM, conceived in the late 1950s. With nine other industry contractors — including North American Aviation’s Autonetics Division, based in Anaheim, CA— Boeing has built, tested and deployed the Minuteman missiles.Minuteman missiles offer a quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to America's strategic deterrent program. Through state-of-the-art improvements, the Minuteman system has been developed to meet new challenges and assume new missions. The latest version – Minuteman III – constitute part of the United States’ Strategic Command that includes the Navy’s Ohio class fleet of ballistic missile submarines and Air Force’s B-2 and B-52 bombers.What’s Favoring Boeing?There has been a rapid rise in terrorist activities across the globe of late. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.Coming to Boeing, apart from enjoying a strong forte in the combat-proven aircraft space thanks to its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog enabled the company to acquire substantial shares of the defense missile industry. Consequently, the company’s Defense, Space & Security segment witnessed healthy revenues and margins growth during the second quarter of 2017, along with an order booking worth $1 billion from the US Missile Defense Agency.Notably, the global missiles and missile defense system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18% during 2017-2024, to reach a value of $41 billion. Given this and the fact that majority of the top 10 weapon manufacturers hail from the U.S., Boeing is expected to win more such awards. This in turn will enable the aircraft major to gain significant traction in the aerospace and defense space, in the coming days.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 78.7% over the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.6%. This might be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. The company also poses strong competition to its peers like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1997,LMT,"Shares of several companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), climbed on Tuesday, just one day after President Donald Trump announced a rededication of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan.President Trump announced that the U.S. would expand its role in Afghanistan during a roughly 30-minute speech on Monday. The president did not specify how many new troops would be deployed in the country or provide a timetable for the operation. However, White House military officials pointed to an increase of up to 4,000 additional U.S. troops.The new U.S. military forces in Afghanistan will be deployed for counterterrorism and military training purposes, which does not differ much from former president Barack Obama and his administration’s tactics in the region.Currently, 8,400 Americans are stationed in Afghanistan, along with roughly 4,000 North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops, based on most estimates. President Trump noted that the added forces are supposed to help fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations such as the Taliban. Some of the troops will focus on training Afghan forces.On the back of the news, shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) both jumped by over 1.5% on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) all saw their stock prices gain between 1% and 1.4%.U.S. defense-based ETF prices also jumped after the announcement was made. Shares of the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report), and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) all jumped around 1%.Yet, even with the addition of 4,000 new American troops in Afghanistan, the total numbers will pale in comparison to the more than 100,000 U.S. troops that were stationed in the country at its 2011-peak.President Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t write “a blank check” nor stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. But the president also came down on one of Afghanistan’s neighbors. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” President Trump said in his speech on Monday.The Pakistani stock exchange KSE 100 index fell by 0.40% on Tuesday, which marks a continued downward trend for the index in August.Additional Gains  On top of the potential gains from an increased U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Lockheed Martin recently won a $427 million deal to work on America’s fleet of F-35 Aircrafts. Boeing and Northrop Grumman also won separate $320-plus million deals to begin to replace America’s aging arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1998,LMT,"Shares of companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), jumped on Tuesday as tensions surrounding North Korea escalated once again, this time in the wake of a missile launch over Japan.North Korea North Korea launched a missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, which eventually landed in the Pacific Ocean. Pyongyang missile launches have become all too commonplace, but the most recent one over Japan was the first of its kind in almost a decade.Kim Jong Un’s regime had never launched a missile over a major foreign population center—his deceased father, Kim Jong Il last fired over Japan’s main islands in 2009. The newest provocation caused not only heightened responses from world leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but helped to send markets and indexes down as well.“A missile launch across Japan is an outrageous act that poses an unprecedented, grave and serious threat, and significantly undermines the peace and security of the region,” Prime Minister Abe said in a statement. “The Government has lodged a firm protest against North Korea. We ask the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting.”Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said he will ask for funds to begin to utilize a land-based version of an anti-missile system used by U.S. battleships called the Aegis Ashore, according to the Wall Street Journal. One unit of the defense system, which is manufactured by Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), costs about $80 billion.The escalating tensions out of North Korea also prompted President Donald Trump to respond.“The world has received North Korea’s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior,” President Trump said in a statement released by the White House.“Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.”Defense StocksOn the back of escalating North Korean tensions, U.S. defense-based stocks saw gains on Tuesday. Shares of Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) climbed over 1.80% to touch a new all-time high of $182.05 a share. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) stock jumped by 1.35% and just missed matching its all-time high.Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) both gained around 1%, while General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) rose 1.25%.Defense ETFs,including the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report), both saw their stock prices rise by over 1%. The iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) gained 0.90%.Other Movement Tied To North KoreaAside from the upward movement by military defense stocks, companies and indexes in the region fell.The iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund ETF (EWY  -  Free Report), which tracks South Korean companies, fell by 0.84%. The Nikkei-225 index, which tracks top-rated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closed down 0.45%.

1999,LMT,"Major defense stocks rallied on Aug 9, following a fresh altercation between the U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un. Notably, Trump warned North Korea that if the nation does not refrain from its repeated missiles threats, the U.S. will respond with “fire and fury.”In retaliation, Kim threatened to fire missiles on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses military bases. While rest of the broader market reacted negatively to the escalated geopolitical tensions, defense stocks picked up pace.However, it is imperative to mention that this cross-border tension between the U.S. and North Korea has not been the only driving force behind the defense stocks’ rally. The defense sector has been a big market winner for quite some time now, on the back of Trump’s presidential win and a few other factors.Factors Driving the U.S. Defense StocksInternational terrorist attacks as well as intra-national conflicts giving rise to varied civil wars have boosted the outlook for the U.S. aerospace and defense industry. Also, the ‘big’ spending promises made by Trump in his budgetary amendments provided an impetus to these stocks.To be specific, the Pentagon's fiscal 2018 (FY18) budget proposal made in March reflectsa total increase of $54 billion over the current level. Through this proposal, Trump not only repealed Obama’s defense sequestration but also made history by proposing the largest one-year increase in the Department of Defense’s funding.In the same month, Trump also proposed to increase the current fiscal’s defense budget by $30 billion. In July, the U.S. House passed the FY18 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion that extensively surpassed Trump’s budget request.Further, rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India have bolstered investors’ optimism in the industry. Also taking advantage of regional tensions prevailing in the Middle East, U.S. defense majors are expanding their foreign markets rapidly. The recently inked foreign military sales contracts include the arms deal worth $110 billion that Trump signed with Saudi Arabia in May. This deal came up with a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years, involving defense bellwethers like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).All these factors boosted the stocks of the broader Aerospace sector (a stand-alone sector) to rally 33.4% in the last year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 12.8% gain.Earnings PictureThe Q2 earnings season is in its last leg and the picture so far appears to be quite encouraging. As of Aug 4, of the 90% defense stocks that have reported their quarterly figures in this space, 88.9% have topped earnings estimates, while 66.7% exceeded revenue estimates.Defense Stocks Soar to New All-Time HighsThis time, the fresh cross-border dispute between the U.S. and North Korea paid off well for defense behemoths – Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – all of which hit new all-time highs on Wednesday, following Trump’s speech. Notably, these companies either manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services that have been the main crux of this latest altercation.

2000,LMT,"Defense stocks have been rising with escalation of tensions between the US and North Korea, while the broader stock rally has stalled. Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) hit record highs after President warned North Korea against making any more threats to the US.Trump said North Korea faces ‘fire and fury like the world has never seen before” and the rogue nation responded by threatening to launch a missile strike on Guam.The sentiment for Aerospace & Defense stocks improves with rising geopolitical tensions. They surged after US missile strikes on Syria.  And, that is one of main reasons why these stocks performed well in the last few years, despite defense budget cuts in the US and Europe.Many developing countries including India, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Brazil have increased their defense spending over the past few years. Of late, Japan and South Korea have also boosted their defense spending in response to increased military spending by China. Trump’s budget proposals call for a boost in US defense spending, which would be positive for these stocks.Most aerospace & defense companies reported excellent earnings for Q2 and have seen continued positive momentum in earnings estimates. Aerospace & Defense ETFs have significantly outperformed the broader market this year.To learn more about top ranked Aerospace & Defense ETFs--the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) and thePowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA  -  Free Report), please watch the short video above.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                             Here's another stock idea to consider.

2001,LMT,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) announced that its aeronautics business segment has secured a $47.8 million contract from the U.S. Air Force.Per the terms of the contract, the company is required to provide engineering and technical services for F-16 aircraft. Work related to the deal will be carried out at the Hill Air Force Base, UT; Toledo, OH; Tucson, AZ and McEntire Joint National Guard Base, SC along with 12 other international locations such as Bahrain, Pakistan, Chile, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco, Taiwan, Oman, Egypt, Iraq, Thailand and Indonesia. Operations are expected to be completed by June 2020.The F-16V, which is the latest F-16 configuration, comes with numerous enhancement designs to make the F-16 aircraft one of the top choices for the international security forces. The latest version is equipped with Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, a modern commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based avionics subsystem, a large format, high-resolution display and a high volume and speed data bus.Importance of Foreign Military SalesForeign Military Sales (FMS) is a program with which the U.S. government assists defense companies in selling related articles and services to other governments or international customers. The U.S. Department of Defense thus works as an intermediary between manufacturers and foreign customers.FMS helps in extending military ties between the United States and other military governments and helps U.S. allies to contribute efficiently in joint missions. The FMS contracts support the top line of the U.S. defense companies when there is a drop in domestic orders.Foreign Military Sales Aids LockheedIn March 2017, President Donald Trump’s administration said that it will go forward with the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Bahrain worth $5 billion. This deal was earlier stalled by the Obama Administration owing to the human rights concerns. This gave a huge boost to this product line for the company. (Read More: Trump Admin to Pursue Lockheed's F-16 Jet Sale to Bahrain)Additionally, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany, helicopters in Poland and missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Middle East regions.Moreover, in the month of May, Trump signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia. Notably, Lockheed Martin seemed to have garnered the majority of this huge pact, with Saudi Arabia set to procure its integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs for $28 billion.Other than the foreign military sales, the proposed hike in the 2018 defense budget is also expected to boost the performance of defense behemoths like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) among others.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have gained 13.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 12% in the last six months.As the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin continues to be a strong cash generator. The recently passed defense policy bill for 2018, with a promise of $696 billion budget, is also expected to boost growth of this defense prime.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2006,LMT,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a contract to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft. It has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA.Contract DetailsValued at $323.5 million, the deal includes a five-year base contract with one five-year option period.Work is scheduled to be completed by Dec 30, 2023 and will be carried out at Missouri. The contract will use Navy working capital funds of fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2023.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet – a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet – is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier.Among the F/A-18 family, F/A 18E is a single-seat variant of the Super Hornet that is about 25% larger than its predecessor, the F/A-18C/D but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In particular, among other defense equipments the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. It also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late.Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Recently, the company clinched a modification contract, valued at $222.5 million, for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command. Again, it won a $349.2 million contract for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. Per the agreement, Boeing will deliver an affordable total system replacement of Minuteman III missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Meanwhile, Trump’s proposal to boost the nation’s defense budget by 10% in 2018 from that of 2016 is likely to benefit defense biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 78.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.4%. This may have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2007,LMT,"Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Missiles and Fire Control, has clinched a modification contract from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The deal involves foreign military sales (FMS) to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.Details of the DealThe contract is valued at $130.3 million. Per the terms, Lockheed Martin will produce the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile for fiscal 2017 with an intention to expand the total missile segment enhancement quantity by 35. In addition, the company will provide 130 launcher modification kits with motor control units to the U.S.; parts library and missile segment enhancement storage and aging requirements to the U.S.; and cost and software data reporting requirement to the U.S. At the same time, it will reduce the missile round trainer quantity by 30 and the empty round trainer quantity by 36 for Qatar.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 other and other procurement (Army) funds to complete the work by Jun 30, 2020. Work related to the modification deal will be carried out at Grand Prairie, Lufkin, El Paso, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL Huntsville, AL; Huntingdon Beach, CA.A Brief Note on PAC-3PAC-3 is the most advanced, capable and powerful terminal air-defense missile that can accost tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. It is a high-velocity interceptor that counters incoming targets by direct body-to-body impact. The PAC-3 missile uses a solid propellant rocket motor, aerodynamic controls, altitude control motors and inertial guidance to navigate.These missiles are currently used by six countries like the U.S., Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Apart from the countries listed under the latest deal, the company also has a contract with Kuwait.According to Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor employs a two-pulse solid rocket motor that increases altitude and range to meet increasing threats. The company expects strong demand for this advanced missile system going forward, particularly in the politically tense regions of the Middle East.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin manufactures combat-proven PAC-3 missiles under production deals from the U.S. Army, Air and Missile Defense Program. This enables the company to enjoy a steady stream of contracts.Meanwhile, the Trump administration put forward the fiscal 2017 budget appropriation in March to expand the nation’s defense fund, citing that years of declining funding levels in the Army's investment and modernization accounts has hampered readiness of the U.S. forces. Notably, the appropriation request included enhanced funding for upgrading Missile defense system of the country.Also, everyone is aware of the continuous missile brawl between North Korea and the U.S that has been taking place for the last few months. All these development, in turn, are bound to boost the demand for today’s A-one missiles such as that of Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3. Consequently, allowing the company to benefit in the near term.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin plans to increase its international mix from 21% in 2016 to 30% of total sales in the upcoming years, owing to robust demand witness overseas for its programs. Latest contracts like the aforementioned ones are expected to uplift the company's international business, substantially. It may also attract more such contracts in the future, since PAC-3 is one of the top priorities in the Pentagon's missile system.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied 12.4% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense  industry’s gain of 27.6%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line, although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. The company faces tough competition from other defense giants like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) .Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Lockheed seemed to have garnered the majority of this huge arms deal. Saudi Arabia is set to procure its integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft, and rotary wing technologies and programs, for $28 billion.Moreover, at the end of the quarter, Lockheed Martin inked a landmark deal with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) – the defense arm of India’s multinational conglomerate, Tata Group – to jointly manufacture the former’s F-16 Block 70 fighter jets in India. This came as a move to expand its foothold in the Indian market, the world’s largest military weapons importer.However, management expects the company’s segment operating profit to remain under pressure for the second quarter and the rest of 2017, due to some unanticipated events that occurred in the first quarter. In fact, these events led the company to reduce its prior 2017 guidance for segment operating profit by $30 million.Moreover, the company’s Missile and Fire Control segment is expected to reflect a slightly lower-than-expected performance in terms of margin for throughout 2017. No improvement can be expected any time soon.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $3.09 per share, down 6.79% year over year, while the revenue estimate is pegged at $12.47 billion, implying a 3.47% year-over-year decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

2012,LMT,"As expected, a plethora of earnings reports have hit the tape this morning, including more of the bigger Wall Street banks and other household brands. Put simply, results are mostly good but ultimately mixed thus far. Let’s try to slog through what we’ve found at this hour.
"
2013,LMT,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are selling off following this earnings report on drastically lower fixed income revenues. Earnings of $3.95 per share beat the $3.51 in the Zacks consensus estimate, on sales of $7.887 billion, well ahead of the $7.57 billion expected. But it was the 40% drop in Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies (FICC, a staple of Goldman Sachs’ holdings) and the second quarter in a row of poor performance in this segment.
"
2014,LMT,"Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) also topped estimates: 46 cents per share on $22.83 billion beat the 43 cents and $21.91 billion, respectively, in the Zacks consensus. An after-tax windfall of $103 million related to the sale of its non-consumer credit card business helped achieve the quarterly beat on the top line. This is at least the fifth quarter in a row of posting an earnings beat for the North Carolina-based bank major.
"
2015,LMT,"Healthcare product retailer Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share to $1.83 in the quarter, though revenues of $18.84 billion missed the $18.90 billion expected. However, guidance for both sales and earnings for fiscal 2017 were revised upward within the earnings report, helping JNJ shares rise 2% immediately following the results.
"
2016,LMT,"Defense contractor giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks consensus for both earnings and revenues: $3.23 per share beat the $3.10 anticipated, and quarterly sales of $12.69 billion beat the $12.46 billion expected. The company’s Aeronautics segment grew 19% year over year, helping boost Lockheed’s results in the quarter, and the shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.
"
2017,LMT,"Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated healthcare provider United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates for its Q2, on revenues that marginally surpassed our consensus. Earnings of $2.46 per share beat by 8 cents in the quarter, and sales of $50.1 billion was a smudge above the $49.97 billion expected. The company has raised its forecast for fiscal 2017, and this marks at least the fifth quarter in a row of an earnings beat. Shares are up modestly at this hour.
"
2018,LMT,"Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) announced that it has received a $64 million contract from the U.S. Army to integrate, test and demonstrate the three complete Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E) systems. The work will be performed primarily at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL) is a manned multi-intelligence plane, which detects, identifies and tracks hostile ground targets using a variety of different sensors.Per the contract, Leidos will be entrusted with integrating the Mission Equipment Payload (MEP) into the Bombardier DHC-8 aircraft, including testing and delivery of the complete ARL-E system. This contract has one-year base period of performance and two nine-month options if exercised. Under the option periods, Leidos will integrate the second and third MEP on ARL-E systems 2 and 3.With the threat perception changing, the U.S. Army is required to upgrade the system it is presently using. The new generation of modular, multi-INT intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems supplied by Leidos will help the army to remain ahead of the evolving-threat environment faced by the forces on the ground.Thanks to its operational and technical expertise, Leidos can properly maintain and upgrade both manned and unmanned airborne systems.  These upgraded ARL-E systems will help the U.S. Army to successfully counter the military challenges faced mainly in the Western Pacific, Middle East and Africa.Focus on Electronic WarfareThe U.S. Defense Department has been focusing on upgrading its existing electronic warfare capabilities across all platforms. Electronic warfare allows detecting the threat well in advance and neutralizing the same before it hurts the defense personnel.Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), with their electronic warfare offering will be able to grab major shares of defense contracts of this nature.Price MovementIn the last three months, Leidos returned 2.6% compared with the Zacks categorized Aerospace –Defense  industry’s gain of 10.0%.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderLeidos currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2019,LMT,"Defense major, Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a contract to support AEGIS SPY-1 Radar requirements. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 2019.Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $23.4 million, has a two-year performance period. It has been awarded by the Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Mechanicsburg, PN.Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will maintain requisition support in reference to stringent availability and delivery metrics, inventory modeling, configuration management, obsolescence management, inventory warehousing, transportation and tracking, and furnishing both repairs and spares for 1,594 line items for fleet requirements.The company will utilize fiscal 2017 working capital (Navy) funding to complete the work, which will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ.What’s AEGIS?AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system. With Lockheed Martin as its primary manufacturer, the AEGIS Weapons system is used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Another company working on AEGIS is Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), which is the manufacturer of this high-powered radar transmitter that tracks and guides missile functions. At the heart of the system is the AN/SPY-1, an advanced, automatic detect and track, multi-function phased-array radar.Over time, AEGIS has become an integral part of the U.S. Navy by evolving with new capabilities to counter emerging threats and leverage new technologies. Notably, its latest configuration, Baseline 9, offers an open architecture framework to allow extreme flexibility.Our ViewLockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics, along with military and commercial orders. Also, it generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27% of its total revenue.Coming to order growth for this segment, the Sikorsky business line of the segment secured a five-year contract worth $3.8 billion for supplying 257 Black Hawk helicopters to the U.S. Army as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, in the second quarter.Currently, the company’s AEGIS is the maritime weapon system of choice for six powerful nations. As of Jan 2017, 84 U.S. Navy ships were in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed. This number will definitely increase given the strong demand for AEGIS prevalent across the globe. Considering this, we expect Lockheed Martin to bag more contracts like the latest one, in days ahead, which, in turn, will boost its profitability.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin rallied 16.1% in the last one year, underperforming the 34.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticized for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2020,LMT,"Continued concerns about rising tensions between the United States and North Korea—as well as a handful of disappointing earnings reports—dragged the stock market down on Thursday morning. Nevertheless, several companies stood out from the pack and soared to new all-time highs.Indeed, the Dow and S&P 500 were down more than 0.5% in early morning trading, and the Nasdaq slipped more than 1%. But that didn’t spoil all the fun. In fact, some stocks even seem to be benefitting from the nervous geopolitical climate.Among today’s new highs is Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), a massive U.S. defense contractor. Shares of Lockheed have since plateaued, but the stock moved more than 1% higher to touch an all-time high of $307.10 per share earlier today.Other defense stocks reaching new heights include Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Northrup Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report). Raytheon is actually down on the day currently, but shares marched to a new peak of $181.60 in morning trading. Northrup Grumman has also moved lower after touching its new all-time high of $274.61 per share (also read: Lockheed Others Hit All-Time Highs on North Korean Escalation).According to Barcharts.com, 19 different stocks have reached new all-time highs so far today. That is slightly outpaced by the 26 stocks touching new lows, but it does put the spotlight on several companies that are outperforming the rest during Thursday’s weak trading.Live Nation Entertainment (LYV  -  Free Report) surged to a new high of $41.91 per share after the company posted solid quarterly results on Wednesday afternoon. The ticketing and event leader reported earnings of 29 cents per share, which smashed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents, and the stock has gained nearly 10% as a result.While earnings news was the catalyst for Live Nation, its M&A news that has spurred Vantiv Inc.  today. This U.S.-based credit card processing company just announced a deal to acquire Worldpay, creating a global payment behemoth. Vantiv will spend about $10.4 billion for the U.K.’s largest payment processing company.Shares of Vantiv peaked at a new high of $70.15 in early trading Thursday, and the stock remained up more than 3.3% through morning hours.Other stocks touching new highs and remaining in the green during morning trading include Starwood Waypoint Homes , Eldorado Resorts (ERI  -  Free Report), and Hailiang Education Group .For a complete list of today’s new highs and lows, make sure to check out Barcharts, and for analysis on why these stocks are moving and if they can keep climbing, stay right here at Zacks.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2021,LMT,"Rising tensions between the US and North Korea weighed on the markets on Wednesday. The blue-chip index briefly slipped from the 22,000 milestone but pared losses to finish above the psychological level. Decline in the Dow was primarily due to losses made by shares of Disney after the media behemoth announced plans to end its distribution deal with Netflix. Escalating geopolitical uncertainties pushed the defense stocks up but weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,048.70, declining by 0.2% or 36.64 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined less than 0.1%, decreasing 0.9 point to close at 2,474.02. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,352.33, slipping 18.13 points or 0.3%. A total of around 6.48 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.16 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.47-to-1 ratio.Disney Slide Fells DowGeopolitical uncertainty between US and North Korea heightened, weighing heavily on the broader markets. The blue-chip index was dragged down primarily by a plunge in shares of The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report). These losses occurred after the media giant announced its plans to discontinue its distribution deal with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and launch its in-house Disney and ESPN steaming services.However, Disney posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. (Read More: Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Top, Unveils Streaming Services)Market Wobbles Due To Geopolitical TensionsThe rising tension between Washington and Pyongyang, after the latter announced plans to attack the Guam Naval base, spiked the defense stocks. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) all increased by 1.7%, 2.6%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. The Dow Jones U.S. defense index soared 1.6%.  Despite S&P 500’s declined over the trading day, seven of the index’s eleven primary sectors ended in positive territory, with utilities leading the decliners and followed by consumer-discretionary, telecom and financial sectors. According to experts, the index has been surprisingly calm with small intraday moves. The S&P 500 has gained or lost 0.3% for close to 15 sessions now. On Wednesday, the index overcame a point 13 point deficit incurred earlier in the session. The Nasdaq also ended in the red but was able to pare a 61 point decline suffered earlier in the session.Volatility Rises, But Remains at Record LowsThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hit a one month high despite trading near all time lows. The best gauge of fear in the market- VIX, was up less than a point by 5.8% to 11.60. By all accounts, this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965. One estimate puts the current level of volatility at the lowest in 52 years. Since Jul 19, the S&P 500 has not gained or lost 0.5% over a single session. Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Patent Violation by Apple to be Investigated by ITCThe United States International Trade Commission (ITC) has decided to investigate a complaint filed by chipset manufacturer, Qualcomm Inc.

2023,LMT,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business unit recently secured a contract for the development and production of a digital receiver exciter for the AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2021.Details of the dealValued at $25.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Marine Corps System Command, Quantico, VA. However the maximum value of the agreement can reach up to $46.7 million, on exercise of options included in the deal.Majority of the work will be executed in Liverpool, NY, while the remaining at Atlanta, GA and Clearwater, FL. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation (Marine Corps) funds to complete the contract. A Brief Note on AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar systemLockheed Martin’s AN/TPS-59A(V)3 is a long-range 3-D ground-based air surveillance radar.The radar, the latest version of the TPS-59 variety fielded in 1985, can detect and track air-breathing targets like aircraft and cruise missiles as far away as 300 miles. It can also detect tactical ballistic missiles as far away as 400 miles. AN/TPS offers 360-degree coverage to elevations of nearly 200 miles.Developed for the United States’ Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the Marine Corps, the TPS-59 (V) 3 is designed to operate with HAWK and Patriot systems. The radar has been designed to be transported by truck, helicopter, or C-130 cargo plane rapidly.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s radar systems offer advanced precision targeting, navigation, threat detection and next generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. In fact, the company’s radars and sensors have been designed and delivered to every armed service and operational environment. Thanks to its advanced radar systems, the company’s RMS unit enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon. Evidently, Lockheed Martin won a contract worth $1.58 billion from the U.S. Army to supply radars that track incoming rocket, mortar and artillery fire in March 2017.In the second quarter of 2017, the RMS business segment generated sales of $3.4 billion, which represented 26.8% of Lockheed Martin’s total sales and witnessed a 3% rise from the year-ago quarter figure. Currently, the company is developing the next generation radars and sensors that can detect, track and identify threats quickly. Considering this, more such radar-based contracts like the recent one can be expected for Lockheed Martin. This in turn will further boost sales growth for the RMS unit.Moreover, in the budget proposals for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations worth $30 billion, the White House requested an extra base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion. Given the current U.S. administration being in favor of higher defense spending, there is a high chance for this proposal getting approved in the U.S. House as well as the Senate. This in turn will definitely improve the growth prospects of defense majors like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) in the nation.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock moved up 24% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.4%.This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2025,LMT,"Tuesday, July 18th, 2017As expected, a plethora of earnings reports have hit the tape this morning, including more of the bigger Wall Street banks and other household brands. Put simply, results are mostly good but ultimately mixed thus far. Let’s try to slog through what we’ve found at this hour.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are selling off following this earnings report on drastically lower fixed income revenues. Earnings of $3.95 per share beat the $3.51 in the Zacks consensus estimate, on sales of $7.887 billion, well ahead of the $7.57 billion expected. But it was the 40% drop in Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies (FICC, a staple of Goldman Sachs’ holdings) and the second quarter in a row of poor performance in this segment.Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) also topped estimates: 46 cents per share on $22.83 billion beat the 43 cents and $21.91 billion, respectively, in the Zacks consensus. An after-tax windfall of $103 million related to the sale of its non-consumer credit card business helped achieve the quarterly beat on the top line. This is at least the fifth quarter in a row of posting an earnings beat for the North Carolina-based bank major.Healthcare product retailer Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share to $1.83 in the quarter, though revenues of $18.84 billion missed the $18.90 billion expected. However, guidance for both sales and earnings for fiscal 2017 were revised upward within the earnings report, helping JNJ shares rise 2% immediately following the results.Defense contractor giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks consensus for both earnings and revenues: $3.23 per share beat the $3.10 anticipated, and quarterly sales of $12.69 billion beat the $12.46 billion expected. The company’s Aeronautics segment grew 19% year over year, helping boost Lockheed’s results in the quarter, and the shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated healthcare provider United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates for its Q2, on revenues that marginally surpassed our consensus. Earnings of $2.46 per share beat by 8 cents in the quarter, and sales of $50.1 billion was a smudge above the $49.97 billion expected. The company has raised its forecast for fiscal 2017, and this marks at least the fifth quarter in a row of an earnings beat. Shares are up modestly at this hour.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

2026,LMT,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $329 million contract from the U.S. Air Force, for the Ground-based Strategic Deterrent.Details of the ContractPer the contract, the company will work toward replacement of aging Minuteman III which will lower the associated technical risk in the missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. Northrop Grumman is expected to finish the work by Aug 20, 2020. All work related to this contract will be primarily carried out at the Redondo Beach, CA facility along with various other locations.Meanwhile, the Air Force has awarded a similar deal worth $349 million to The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) for Ground-based Strategic Deterrent.According to Reuters, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) was another competitor who bid for the contract. However, Pentagon decided to go with the first two, for now.About Minuteman IIIBoeing’s Minuteman series of missiles are land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in service with the U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command. The first range of Minuteman missiles entered the service in the early 1960s and has evolved with time since its initiation. These weapon systems have been known to provide quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to the country’s strategic deterrent program.The Need of the HourWith rising threats from North Korea along with expansion of global terrorism, it has become extremely important for the U.S. to keep its defense weaponries updated.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants including Northrop Grumman.Notably, Northrop Grumman has developed into one of the largest domestic defense contractor in terms of revenue, with a major platform-centric focus. The company has a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs which have aided it in securing regular contracts from the different verticals of U.S. Defense. We believe the recently won deal is an example of that and will boost the company’s growth trajectory, going ahead.Price MovementShares of Northrop Grumman have returned 24.8% in the last one year compared to the industry’s increase of 34.6% in the same time period.This might have been led by the company’s escalating operating expenses, while steep competition from peers also remains a major concern.Zacks Rank and Other Stock to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock in the same space is Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), also carrying a Zacks rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Huntington Ingalls delivered a positive surprise of 22.52% in the second quarter of 2017.

2027,LMT,"NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) share prices have appreciated 51.3% this year when the S&P 500 managed a mere 8.5%. So it’s reasonable to feel at least a little concerned about the valuation, even if the company’s growth opportunities abound.And there’s no denying the secular drivers in each of the markets NVIDIA serves, whether it’s gaming, data center, artificial intelligence or cryptocurrencies.The current boom in the most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin (on the blockchain system) is driven by bitcoin mining (requires tremendous processing power offered by GPUs), with the momentum unlikely to continue through next year. But new cryptocurrencies like ether (supported by the Ethereum system) and other coins like Monero, Dash, Stratis, Syscoin, Litecoin and Factom are emerging that should ensure continued momentum in GPU demand.The underlying reason that the market remains hot is the stability relative to most other currencies in the world. Moreover, cryptocurrencies actually appreciate in value when geopolitical factors negatively impact the currency market, further boosting mining and the demand for processing power.NVIDIA has competition from the other discrete GPU provider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), but the company is really well positioned in areas like gaming. The success of the Nintendo Switch has been very good for NVIDIA. Gaming is an ever expanding market, given the move toward e-sports, which in the past management called “as popular among U.S. male millennials as America's favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), ESPN, and Hulu combined.”VR is yet to gain momentum because of limited volumes of machines that can handle the content and a relatively limited volume of content. But this is definitely one area waiting to grow and NVIDIA is ready for it with its GTX 1080 Ti. It is however seeing some interest on the professional VR side with a rather illustrious customer in Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report).The biggest driver of shares is, however, the data center. Sequential growth in the last quarter was less than exciting (due to new product transition issues), but it’s equally hard to ignore the 175.5% growth from last year. There are two major legs to this growth, the first being machine learning and the second, high performance computing (HPC). GPU acceleration (the 100X faster Volta-based V100 accelerator started shipping last quarter) of servers is very cost effective for data center operators, so growth should continue for several years at least as corporate workloads keep moving to the cloud. In the last quarter for instance Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) agreed to use NVIDIA GPUs in its AWS G3 instances.To put all of this into perspective, note that NVIDIA generated 53% of its revenue from Gaming in the last quarter, with the balance coming from Data Center (19%), Professional Visualization (11%), Auto (6%) and OEM & IP (11%). So Gaming and Data Center together account for 72% of the business and have a combined average growth rate of around 72%. Plus there are multiple growth drivers in both to ensure than this strong momentum continues. This is pretty phenomenal and the reason the share price appreciation is not just about hype. It therefore makes perfect sense to buy the dips whenever possible.NVDA shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2029,LMT,"General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a $14.9 million contract by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Yongsan, Korea.Details of the ContractThis is a modification contract per which the company will provide support and maintenance services for the combined mission command network operations.Work related to this deal will be carried out in the Republic of Korea and is expected to be over by Jul 31, 2018. The contract amount will be obligated at the time of the award from the fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Army) funds.Our ViewPresident Donald Trump’s proposed 10% hike on the 2018 defense budget has boosted the overall defense sector. Moreover, due to rise in global terrorism many non-U.S. countries have raised their defense budget lately.As a result, General Dynamics along with other defense giants such as Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) have been receiving regular contracts from different verticals of the U.S. Military.In particular, General Dynamics’ diverse product portfolio along with its spread-out customer base has provided it with opportunities to generate revenues from different sources. Moreover, the company has been consistently witnessing increased sales from non-U.S. based sources. These sources have helped General Dynamics to counter the volatility in domestic defense spending.Further, the company has a strong research and development segment that promotes the introduction of new products and first-to-market enhancements. General Dynamics’ wider customer choices, improved aircraft performance and new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity are expected to boost its growth trajectory, over the long run.Price MovementShare price of General Dynamics has rallied 39.6% in the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 26.5%.This could be because General Dynamics consistently maintains a strategic alliance with the U.S. Department of Defense, which allows it to enjoy a steady flow of contracts.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2032,LMT,"Defense behemoth, General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, secured a modification contract worth $20.6 million, for supplying aircraft bombs. The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Arsenal, IL.Details of the DealAccording to the deal, the company will provide 10,933 MK82-6 bomb bodies, 866 MK84-4 bomb bodies and 1,365 MK84-10 bomb bodies to support the Air Force, the Navy and the foreign military sales (FMS) requirements.The modification covers FMS to Australia, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. It will be executed in Garland, TX, and will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 aircraft procurement (Army) funds.A Brief Note on MK82 & MK84The Gun and Guided Missile Director MK82, produced by Ordnance and Tactical Systems, is a component of the Group MK81. Currently, it is being produced for Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aegis Weapon System MK7.Markedly, the Antenna Assembly AS-34444/SPG-62 that is produced by Raytheon Co's (RTN  -  Free Report) Equipment Division is mounted on the MK82 by an elevation-over-train pedestal to provide space stabilization for the radar's line of site. The assembly is an unmanned system, which is capable of moving on two axes, train and elevation.MK84 is a general purpose bomb and also the largest of the MK80 series of weapons. It is a free-fall, non-guided GP 2,000-pound bomb that is used in the majority of bombing operations where maximum blast and explosive effects are desired. These bombs are relatively light and approximately 45% of their total weight is explosive.Our TakeGeneral Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the leading commercial disposer of explosive materials and devices in the United States. It is one of the leading manufacturers of mortar weapons and systems, bomb bodies and propellants. This unit falls under the General Dynamics Combat Systems segment.As a whole, General Dynamics engages in mission-critical information systems and technologies, land and expeditionary combat vehicles, armaments and munitions, shipbuilding and marine systems and business aviation. It is the leading tank and artillery ammunition producer providing high-performance ammunition to the U.S. armed forces.During the second quarter of 2017, the Combat Systems segment generated 9% year-over-year revenue growth. We can expect consistent growth in the segment's top line, going forward. The improvement is expected to be driven by strong demand for its products and frequent contract wins like the aforementioned ones.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 29.9% in the last year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 41.4%. This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cuts will hurt the company’s growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space include Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leidos Holdings delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 18.01% in the last four quarters.

2033,LMT,"Falls Church, VA-based Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., has won a contract to offer overall operations, and maintenance of command and control capabilities for the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $98 million, has been awarded by the 55th Contracting Squadron, Offutt Air Force Base, NE.Per the deal, Northrop Grumman will provide software engineering, system engineering, testing, incorporation, installation, security engineering and administrative support. Additionally, the company will offer added support tasks necessary to give dependable, effective, and user-friendly, net-centric abilities in order to contribute to the overall operations and maintenance of USSTRATCOM C2 capabilities for the commander of USSTRATCOM.Furthermore, these tasks will support combatant commands, component commands, and other authorized users with modernized mission critical communications and computer systems employing general integrated information and decision toolsets, applications and capabilities in a fully-synchronized, net-centric information environment, essential for maintaining deterrence and, if required, dominate in conflict.The work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2023, and performed in Offutt Air Force Base, NE. The contract will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds.Qualities of USSTRATCOMHeadquartered at Offutt Air Force Base, NE, USSTRATCOM is one of nine unified commands in the U.S. Department of Defense. Also, it is liable for strategic deterrence, global strike, and operating the defense department's Global Information Grid. USSTRATCOM offers a number of abilities to support other combatant commands that covers strategic warning; integrated missile defense; and global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR). Notably, this vibrant command gives national leadership a unified resource for better understanding of specific threats around the world and the means to respond to those threats swiftly.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. In addition, the company continues to witness strong demand for its unmanned air systems on a global scale.Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, the outlook for various stocks in this space has improved manifold in recent months on the back of enhanced spending promises that Trump had made in his latest “America First” budget.Specifically, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal reflected an annual increase of approximately $2.2 billion over the year-ago budget. Again, the Trump administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations included an additional base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion. A moderate flow of funds from the Pentagon also added to the optimism.Going forward, we expect the increased spending to be allocated to certain key areas that might unlock higher opportunities for Northrop Grumman.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has been up 19.9% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 27.6%. This could be because higher operating expenses continue to partially impact Northrop Grumman’s profit margin. Also, the company may be challenged by economic and political factors. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment, customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which is a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

As a result, huge budget has been allotted to the program. General Dynamics being the prime navy contractor, is expected to win a major portion of contracts from the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Industry’s ScenarioDefense industry as a whole got a good boost when President Trump proposed a 10% hike in the 2018 Defense budget. Since then the industry has witnessed regular orders being awarded by different verticals of the U.S. defense.Earlier this month, Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Newport News, has clinched a $9.7 million modification contract to support the advance planning of the refueling complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73).

2037,LMT,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Lockheed Martin is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LMT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.12 per share for LMT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LMT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.97% heading into earnings season.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

2039,LMT,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region.

2040,LMT,"Defense major, Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract to supply fiscal 2017 AEGIS modernization production requirements. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Dec 2020.Details of the DealThe contract, worth $76.6 million, was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Moreover, the value of the deal can increase up to $192.3 million, if the options included in the modification are exercised.The company will utilize fiscal 2017 defense-wide procurement; 2015, 2016 and 2017 other procurement, 2012 shipbuilding and conversion, and foreign military sales funding to complete the work. Majority of the modification work will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ. The remaining tasks will be executed in Clearwater, FL and Owego, NY.What’s AEGIS?AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system. With Lockheed Martin as its primary manufacturer, the AEGIS Weapons system is used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Another company working on AEGIS is Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). At the heart of the system is the AN/SPY-1, an advanced, automatic detect and track, multi-function phased-array radar. Raytheon is the manufacturer of this high-powered radar transmitter that tracks and guides missile functions.Over time, AEGIS has become an integral part of the U.S. Navy by evolving with new capabilities to counter emerging threats and leverage new technologies. Its latest configuration, Baseline 9, offers an open architecture framework to allow extreme flexibility.Our ViewLockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics, along with military and commercial orders. It generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27% of its total revenue.Coming to order growth for this segment, the Sikorsky business line of the segment secured a $3.8 billion worth five-year contract for supplying 257 Black Hawk helicopters to the U.S. Army, as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, in the second quarter.Currently, Lockheed Martin's Aegis is the maritime weapon system of choice for six powerful nations. As of Jan 2017, 84 U.S. Navy ships were in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed. This number will definitely rise given the strong demand for AEGIS prevalent across the globe. Considering this, we expect Lockheed Martin to bag more contracts like the latest one, in days ahead, which, in turn, will boost its profitability.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 14% in the last one year, underperforming the 28.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2041,LMT,"On Jul 20, shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) have soared to a new 52-week high of $211.25, before closing the trading session at $210.28. The closing price of this aerospace and defense prime, which has a market cap of around $126.9 billion, reflects a year-to-date gain of roughly 35.1%.Over the last 52 weeks, Boeing’s shares have ranged from a low of $126.31 to a high of $211.25. The average volume of shares traded in the last three months is approximately 2.9 million.What's Driving Boeing?In June, at the Paris Air Show, Boeing announced the launch of the 737 Max 10, a new model that will compete with the Airbus Group's (EADSY) extremely popular narrow-body passenger jet, the A321neo.Notably, the Max 10 is the fifth member of Boeing’s single-aisle aircraft series and the third of the Max family. It was designed to be larger than its previous model in order to increase passenger capacity compared with the A321neo’s capacity, which was outselling the 737 Max 9.So far the decision has paid off. Evidently, Boeing received huge number of contracts for the new model leaving Airbus far behind. At the Paris Air Show, the company won 50 737 Max 10 jets orders, valued at $6.24 billion, from Lion Group. It also signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.In addition to the aforementioned deals, Boeing grabbed notable contracts for other models at the Paris Air Show, including a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion, at current list prices.Furthermore, the aerospace behemoth signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet, for 40 737 MAX airplanes, valued at $4.7 billion. Another MOU was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes, valued at approximately $2.5 billion.Apart from this, the company clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is expected to witness significant traction going ahead, especially in the single-aisle market.Notably, the second-quarter order details revealed by Boeing of late, shows that it booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects an increase from the year-ago figure of 171, which also will contribute significantly to the company’s top line.In the defense arena, Trump’s proposal to boost the nation’s defense budget by 10% in 2018 from that of 2016 is likely to benefit defense biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Again, the Trump administration has put forward the fiscal 2017 budget appropriation to expand the nation’s defense fund, citing that years of declining funding levels in the Army's investment and modernization accounts has hampered readiness of the U.S. forces. Such positive budget revisions will surely boost the company's growth trajectory as well.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 57.6% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 27.8%. This might be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
