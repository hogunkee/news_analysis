14,AON,"Aon plc’s (AON  -  Free Report) robust inorganic growth has boosted its foothold in the insurance brokerage market. The company’s acquisitions mainly aim at expanding the health and benefits business as well as risk and insurance solutions operations. Strategic alliances have also bolstered Aon’s scale of business. The acquisition of Admix and the international benefit brokerage portfolio of the Mayfair group are worth a mention here. In September 2017, the company enhanced its investment capabilities with the buyout of The Townsend Group. These initiatives have significantly paved the way for Aon’s long-term growth.The company’s financial health impresses. Consistent generation of operating cash flow has enabled Aon to deploy capital in an effective manner. Also, it has been enhancing shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share repurchases. Year to date, the company’s shares have gained 24%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 21%. This reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock. Along with adding businesses, the company continues to divest non-core operations to streamline its core operations. The sale of its benefits administration and HR BPO platform to Blackstone Group in the first half of 2017 not only reduced its non-core expenses but also generated higher return on equity.Aon’s strong expense management program is impressive. Its operating expenses started declining since 2015. The divestment of non-core HR business is likely to reduce Aon’s overall costs in the coming quarters, in turn, propelling bottom-line growth.However, the company’s operations suffer from a high debt level. Consequently, interest expenses started rising since 2013. This is expected to weigh on Aon’s profitability.Moreover, Aon’s world-wide operations have been facing unfavorable impact of foreign exchange volatility on its earnings per share and revenues since 2012. This may lead to earnings volatility, in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAon presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in stocks from the insurance space can check out Radian Group Inc.

The deal will help it align with Sun Life’s strategy of expanding its wealth management business in Canada.Details of the DealThe financial and other regulatory terms of the transaction remain undisclosed. Notably, the company anticipates completion of the same by the end of fourth-quarter 2017, pending approvals. On wrapping up the transaction, Excel Funds will join the family of Sun Life.Benefits Behind the DealSun Life Global Investments has displayed continued growth, since inception in 2010, with more than $18 billion in assets under management. The transaction will help Sun Life Global Investments execute its strategy to extend a range of new and advanced solutions to make it available to clients. Interestingly, the buyout will be a substantial value addition to Sun Life Global Investments’ portfolio, as Excel Funds and the acquirer share a compatible product line-up, utilizing a sub-advisor business model.Sun Life Global Investments remains focused on growing its base through offerings in emerging markets, such as India, which will provide a significant growth opportunity for investors.

20,AON,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 moved south by 2.1% and for 2018, by 0.5%. In fact, Travelers failed to beat estimates in two of the last four quarters.The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of F. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Shares of Travelers have lost 1.4% in a year, lagging the industry’s growth of 17.5% as well as the S&P 500’s 15.9% gain.The underwriting results of non-life insurers will be affected due to damages caused by Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas sometime back and was assigned Category 4 Hurricane.  Before one could come to terms with the devastation occurred, Hurricane Irma is already making way to be deemed as another Category 4 Hurricane, which could strike regions ranging from Caribbean to Florida.Travelers being a property and casualty insurer will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events since its underwriting results have severely taken a beating. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the industry already suffered $53 billion in catastrophe losses in the first half of 2017, the highest figure since 2011.The company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Notably, the first half of 2017 marked the highest level of catastrophe losses for the company in the past six years. Combined ratio — indicative of the underwriting loss or profit of a company — deteriorated.Travelers has also been witnessing increasing expenses, weighing on operating income expansion and thus inducing volatility to the bottom line.The Federal Reserve announced intention for three rate hikes in 2017 with another three in 2018. The Fed has already made two hikes in the first half of 2017. However, at the annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole, WY on Aug 25, no hints were dropped about the next hike in interest rates. The lack of signals about the announcement of the next rate hike was interpreted as ‘dovish’ by the markets. For 2017, Travelers anticipates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis as compared to 2016.Nonetheless, an improving interest rate environment is aiding investment results of the insurers.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to weather the loss to some extent.Also, influx of capital, building of reserves and containment of underwriting expenses must pave the way for growth prospects.Choosing the StocksThere are other attractive stocks in the property & casualty insurance industry that may not be as big a name as Travelers but promise greater returns.We have boiled down to two other stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio.

22,AON,"The insurance industry fears high claims due to occurrence of Hurricane Harvey last Friday. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the industry already digested $53 billion in catastrophe losses in the first half of 2017, which registered the highest figure since 2011.Harvey hit Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast last week and is assigned to be Category 4 Hurricane. Per insurance analysts at J.P. Morgan, losses from Hurricane Harvey could range between $10 billion to $20 billion preliminary. However, this could exceed the primary estimate, given the intensity of damage caused.This catastrophe loss will upset the insurers’ underwriting results, especially for carriers with a significant exposure to Houston and Texas Gulf Coast. However, insurers can gear up for raising higher premiums due to massive catastrophe losses.Amid bad news, the silver lining for the insurance industry is the improving interest rate environment, reflecting an improving U.S. economy in turn. With the Federal Reserve already hiking rates twice this year (intended for one more), the insurers stand to benefit from the progressing rate environment.Assured Value Picks to Play the Present SituationWe have zeroed in on three undervalued stocks which investors might add to their portfolio. Value investing is for those looking to buy stocks with the value lower than the intrinsic one. Hence, these investors target stocks with a low price-to-book (P/B) ratio or with high dividend yields. P/B ratio is the best multiple for valuing insurers owing to their unpredictable financial results.We thus refine our search using the Value Score of A or B and a bullish Zacks Rank. A Buy rated stock with a Value Score of A or B are best investment bets.Carmel, IN-based CNO Financial Group Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) develops, administers and markets supplemental health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products. The company has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It is currently trading at a P/B ratio of 0.79, lower than the industry average of 1.35. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of the company have surged 36.1% in a year, thus outperforming the industry’s growth of 24.8%.  Milwaukee, WI-based MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG  -  Free Report) primarily covers single-family, first-time mortgage loans by providing primary insurance to cushion lenders against non-payment of individual loans. The company has a Value Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2. It is currently trading at a P/B ratio of 1.39.Shares of the company have soared 37.8% in a year, outperforming the industry’s rise of 24.9%.  Reno, Nevada-based Employers Holdings, Inc.

It is currently trading at a P/B ratio of 1.51.Shares of the company have rallied 39.5% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 14.8% increase.  4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

23,AON,"In the insurance industry, the property and casualty insurers are the major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The interest rate environment has been slowly on the better end with Fed (Federal Reserve) raising interest rates thrice in three consecutive quarters (0.25% in December 2016, 1% in March 2017 and 1.25% in June 2017). This reflects Fed’s confidence in the improving U.S. economy.The Fed had earlier indicated of three interest rate hikes in 2017, of which, two have already been made by the first half of 2017. An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other positives.Underwriting results, the major indicator of profitability for any insurer, will remain volatile owing to occurrence of catastrophes. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of global catastrophe losses is $53 billion in the first half of 2017, the highest since 2011. Underwriting results will thus suffer as catastrophes are on the rise.Nonetheless, improving economy indicating more disposable income and better consumer sentiment should support more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher. Influx of capital, building of reserves and containment of underwriting expenses also pave the way for growth prospects.Though the Property and Casualty Insurance industry is currently ranked at #203 (lies at the bottom one-third of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries), it has outperformed the S&P 500 in a year by registering a rally of 19.3%. The index on the other hand climbed 10.9%.Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers. Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) writes property and casualty, reinsurance and insurance in the United States, Bermuda and international markets, while XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is a leading global provider of insurance, reinsurance and financial risk solutions for enterprises and insurance companies. While Everest Re has a market capitalization of $10.8 billion, XL Group has $11.3 billion of the same.Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.A better-ranked stock from the same industry is Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report), flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceBoth Everest Re and XL Group have outpaced the industry with shares surging 39.4% and 30.3%, respectively. Here, Everest Re emerges a clear winner.ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple, used for valuing insurers. Compared with Property and Casualty Industry’s P/B ratio of 1.47, Everest Re is underpriced with a reading of 1.26. Meanwhile, XL Group is much cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 0.86. This round goes to XL Group as the company’s shares are cheaper than Everest Re’s.Debt-to-EquityBoth XL Group and Everest Re have lower debt-to-equity versus the industry average of 33.31%. Everest Re with a leverage ratio of 7.38 has an edge over XL Group with the same of 24.48.Return on EquityEverest Re’s return on equity of 13.60% outpaced the industry average of 6.18%. However, XL Group’s return on equity of 4.88% underperformed the industry. Everest Re thus wins this round.Dividend YieldIn a year’s period, Everest Re’s dividend yield was 1.91%, while XL Group’s was 2.01%.  Both have a dividend yield that outshines the industry’s average of 0.49%.  Comparatively, XL Group has an edge over Everest Re.Earnings Surprise HistoryRegarding the companies’ surprise history, XL Group has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 14.89%. Whereas, Everest Re delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters with a four-quarter average beat of 46.59%.Everest Re has an edge over XL Group.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsXL Group’s 2017 estimates have inched up 1.9% but slid 2.9% for 2018 in the last 30 days.  On the other hand, Everest Re’s 2017 estimates have moved up 2.6% and 1.3% for 2018 over the same time frame.For XL Group, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $3.25 for 2017, reflecting a year-over-year surge of 99.08%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.97, representing a year-over-year rise of 22.39%. XL Group has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 9.0%.For Everest Re, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $21.42 for 2017, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.3%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $20.23, representing a year-over-year decrease of 5.6%. Everest Re has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 10.0%.This round therefore goes equally to both the companies.To ConcludeEverest Re holds an edge over XL Group on price performance, leverage, return on equity and the earnings surprise history.  Considering parameters like valuation and dividend yield, XL Group seems better poised than Everest Re. However, based on our comparative analysis, Everest Re presently has an advantage over XL Group.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

24,AON,"Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report) offers risk management services, insurance and reinsurance brokerage, human resource consulting and outsourcing services worldwide. The company has been able to strengthen its position in the market on the back of robust inorganic growth as well as a strong capital position.Aon’s operating cash flow has been strong over the years and has enabled it to deploy capital in an effective manner. It has been enhancing shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share repurchases.In the last one year, the stock has gained 26%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18%. This reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock.Aon has witnessed substantial inorganic growth over the last three years. Its buyouts are mainly aimed at expanding the health and benefits business as well as risk and insurance solutions operations. Strategic alliances also bolstered Aon’s scale of business. The acquisition of Admix and the international benefit brokerage portfolio of the Mayfair group are worth a mention here. These initiatives have significantly paves the way for the company’s long-term growth.Aon continues to divest non-core operations to streamline its business. In the first half of 2017, it sold off its benefits administration and HR BPO platform to Blackstone Group. This not only helped in avoiding non-core expenses but generated higher return on equity.Aon’s expense management programs impress. Operating expenses started declining since 2015. Despite a nominal increase in the first half of 2017, the divestment of non-core HR business is likely to reduce Aon’s overall costs in the coming quarters, in turn, aiding the margin growth.However, the company’s operations suffer from a high debt level. Aon has been issuing debts to repay outstanding debts which resulted in mounting level of long-term borrowings. Consequently, interest expenses started rising since 2013, at a three-year average growth rate of 7.6%. This, in turn, is expected to weigh on Aon’s profitability.Moreover, as a global corporation, Aon has been facing unfavorable impact of foreign exchange volatility on its earnings per share and revenues since 2012. This may lead to earnings volatility.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker alsolooks expensive at the current level. Looking at the company’s forward Price-to-Earnings ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. It currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 21.3, which is above its range’s median of 17.7 and near the highest point of 21.6. It is also significantly higher than the industry average of 16.70 as well as the S&P 500’s average of 19.2.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are First American Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc.

25,AON,"Aon plc’s (AON  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $1.45 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings also increased 13.3% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenues.Adjusted margin, adjusted for certain items, increased 110 basis points to 22.4%.Operational UpdateAon’s total revenue grew 4% to $2.4 billion in the second quarter and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. The year-over-year increase in revenues was supported by 3% organic revenue growth and a 3% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Operating expenses increased 31% year over year to $2.5 billion in the second quarter. The rise was primarily due to $380 million non-cash impairment charge to the associated indefinite lived trade names related to the sale of the Benefits Administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) platform. In addition, higher restructuring costs, acquisition related expenses, regulatory costs and depreciation & amortization also led to this deterioration. However, this was partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translations, expense related to certain non-cash pension settlements in the prior-year period and savings from restructuring activities and operational initiatives.Organic Revenue DriversCommercial Risk Solutions: Organic revenues increased 2% year over year, driven by strong growth across the Pacific region, in both Australia and New Zealand, and solid growth in the U.S. and Canada. This was partially offset by a modest decline in Latin America and Asia.Reinsurance Solutions: Organic revenues increased 6% from the prior-year quarter on the back of strong growth in capital markets, as well as growth in facultative placements and net new business generation in treaty. The improvement was partially offset by a modest unfavorable market impact globally.Retirement Solutions: Organic revenues grew 1% from the prior-year period, driven by continued growth in investment consulting, primarily for delegated investment management. This was partially offset by a decline in  talent practice.Health Solutions: Organic revenues rose 5% year over year owing to solid growth globally in health & benefits brokerage, highlighted by strong growth in the U.S., Asia, and EMEA.Data & Analytic Services: Organic revenues climbed 4% from the prior-year period driven by strong growth across Affinity, with strength particularly in the U.S.Aon PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aon PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aon PLC QuoteFinancial PositionCash flow from operations for the first six months of 2017 decreased 22%, to $436 million compared to the prior-year period. The decline primarily reflects $94 million of cash restructuring charges and $44 million of transaction related costs, partially offset by operational improvement.Free cash flow decreased 28% to $354 million for the first six months of 2017 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations and a $14 million increase in capital expenditures.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateWeighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 3% year over year to 262.4 million in the second quarter.The company repurchased 8 million Class A Ordinary shares for approximately $1 billion in the quarter. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had $6.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.In Apr 2017, the company announced a 9% increase in its quarterly cash dividend.Business UpdateAon completed the sale of the Benefits Administration and HR BPO platform for $4.3 billion of cash consideration.

27,AON,"The second-quarter earnings season is well underway with 34.2% members of the elite S&P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the performance of 171 index members (accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 8.8% on 3.4% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.9% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.8%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. About 43.2% of the S&P 500 index members, that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.7% earnings growth on 5.2% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for the bottom line and 70.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. Few insurers are expected to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter, stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events, occurred during April and May in the U.S.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion, built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the developing economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have supported more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher to contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line. This apart, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have possibly benefited the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing out pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing.Let’s evaluate the performance of the following three insurers ahead of their release of quarterly numbers on Jul 31.CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) offers commercial P&C insurance products, mainly across the United States. Last quarter, CNA Financial substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.13%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP  of +4.00% make us confident of an earnings beat this time.

Rising interest rate environment likely have favored higher net investment income. Disciplined approach toward the market is expected to have resulted in an improvement in new business. However, higher expenses might have hurt the company’s overall profitability.  (Read: CNA Financial Q2 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards? )With respect to the surprise trend, CNA Financial beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 12.45%.CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CNA Financial Corporation QuoteLoews Corporation (L  -  Free Report) provides commercial property and casualty insurance in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore.

The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 72 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 76 cents per share.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5), going into an earnings announcement.Ongoing challenging conditions in the offshore drilling market might have induced lower revenues at its Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report). Due to challenging market conditions, thereby resulting in lower rates and a decreased insured exposure likely have hurt underwriting results. Loews Corp. has likely witnessed a solid performance at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP  -  Free Report) and Loews Hotels units in the second quarter.

28,AON,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.70%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterDiscover Financial is likely to witness solid revenue growth driven by strong loan growth which is one of its key focus areas.The company’s PULSE business is likely to continue its recent trend of modest growth.The recently launched Cashback Match program is expected to aid revenue growth by boosting sustained customer engagement beyond the promotion period.The company’s frequently undertaken share repurchase programs aimed at enhancing shareholders’ value, is expected to impact the bottom line positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Nevertheless, Discover Financial’s operating expenses have been showing a flat trend over past few quarters, but marketing expenses are likely to rise due to its extensively undertaken promotional activities.Also, surging medical costs for individual ACA (Affordable Care Act) compliant products might limit the margin.In addition, rising level of debt is likely to result in an increase in interest expenses in the second quarter, limiting the margin.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Discover Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Discover Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

29,AON,"The second-quarter earnings season has rolled out with 19% members of the elite S&P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 97 index members (accounting for 28.1% of index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.4% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 72.2% outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. 53.3% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported quarterly results shows 7.2% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 81.1% for the bottom line and 66.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) projects $638 million in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment. This in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, driving premiums higher, which contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing pricing, leading to soft pricing.  Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers.This week will see more than 800 companies reporting their quarterly results, including 183 S&P 500 members.Let’s find out how these four insurers might perform when they release their quarterly numbers on Jul 26.XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s leading providers of insurance, reinsurance and financial risk solutions for enterprises and insurance companies.

31,AON,"Mastercard Inc.

The company exceeded earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.38%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the company’s top line in the second quarter to gain traction from its strong international business. This will likely be offset to some extent from softness in its U.S. credit card business, given the loss of one of its client, USAA, to Visa Inc.The company’s disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.We expect increased purchase volume and processed transaction, which will increase its business volume in the quarter led by higher spending by members as the economy continues to improve.Also, substantial investment in technology, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard’s top-line growth.The company’s effort in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, is a differentiator for the company in the market. Higher utilization of the company’s service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected to be seen in the quarter to be reported.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to impact from new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company’s bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international market than in the prior year.The company’s use of capital in buying back shares, with the effect of reducing the share count, will help the company’s bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat earnings this quarter.
