4,ULTA,"Specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been quietly undergoing a change.Two statistics describe the change: At the end of fiscal 2014, online sales accounted for about 4% of Ulta's total sales. As of the recent conference call in March, the percentage grew to 12.8%.The tripling is impressive when the investor considers this came while Ulta's overall sales were showing no slowdown from their historically fast pace. Revenue grew 20% to 25% in each of the past seven years.Also, Ulta Beauty continues to add to its physical-store count.At the conference call in March, CEO Mary Dillon noted that Ulta Beauty opened 16 new stores in Q4 and plans to open 100 in 2018. The company has 1,074 stores.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""One area of focus will be our store experience,"" Dillon said.She explained, ""We continue to evolve our store format to respond to guests' rising expectations for an experiential environment.""The experiential environment is a key ingredient for many successful retailers. Such stores create an ambience. For retailers such as Sephora, the Apple Store, Whole Foods Market and Pinkberry, the appeal is substance and style.Meanwhile, e-commerce has received a load of attention, even if the industrywide statistics draw a smaller picture than news coverage would suggest.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales in Q4 accounted for 9.1% of total sales industrywide.In that respect, Ulta's 12.8% weighting in e-commerce sales is bigger than the market's weighting.One area where Ulta Beauty is strong is pretax profit margins. In fiscal 2018, pretax margin was 13.7%, the highest in at least nine years. Pretax margin hit double-digit percentages in 2012 and has stayed in double digits since.Amazon.com (AMZN) is the king of online retail, but the retailer now has a bigger physical-stores footprint than not too long ago.In Q1 2018, Amazon's physical store footprint was about 8.4% of net sales. In the full year 2017, the physical footprint was about 3.3%.Amazon completed the acquisition of Whole Food Markets in August, which boosted Amazon's physical-store sales.Ulta Beauty's stock rose about 33% from October to January. This served as the 30% prior uptrend for Ulta's most recent base. The base is 23% deep and part of a much larger consolidation.The stock has been trying to close above a 249.40 buy point in recent sessions.Amazon's chart is a late-stage story, which carries more risk of failure than an early stage breakout. The stock shaped a short, cup-with-handle base. Although a handle sketched a high at 1568.62, the pattern was too short to be valid.RELATED:Taser's Parent Company Soars7 Ways To Profit From The Trump BumpCan A Great Stock Lead After A Late-Stage Base?

5,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA), the beauty-products and salon chain, reported first-quarter earnings after the closing bell that beat expectations. But the company's second-quarter outlook came in below what analysts were looking for.XEstimates: A 29% jump in earnings per share to $2.48, on revenue up 16% $1.526 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales are expected to rise 6.9%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Earnings per share of $2.70, up 31.7%. Net sales rose 17.4% to $1.543 billion. Same-store sales rose 8.1%.The company forecast second-quarter net sales of $1.475 billion to $1.488 billion, below estimates for $1.498 billion. And it projected EPS for Q2 of $2.35-$2.40, below forecasts for $2.50.Ulta said it expected same-store sales for Q2 to increase by 6%-7%, a slowdown from the period a year ago and from the first quarter of this year.Stock: Shares dropped 3% after hours in the stock market today. Skin care and makeup giant Estee Lauder (EL) was unchanged late Thursday, but near a 153.98 buy point of a flat base. Estee Lauder closed 1.16% lower to 149.44.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUlta tends to be cautious with its sales forecasts. But even as same-store sales rise, Ulta has been competing against high expectations and shrinking room for error.Beauty-product discounting, concerns about slowing sales and margins, and signs Amazon could advance further into the beauty-products market helped sink Ulta's stock last year.Shares have rebounded since April. And Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, in a research note dated Monday, said the company stands to benefit from the popularity of skin care products and the rollout of prestige boutiques. She cited ""healthy traffic"" in Ulta stores and ""stabilized promotional activity"" — or competitive price cutting — compared with last year as other positives during the quarter.The chain this spring has been the No. 1 preferred beauty destination among average-income teenagers, above Sephora and Walmart (WMT), according to Piper Jaffray's research. The company's online traffic and sales have also increased.Ulta Beauty has long been pitched as a gem among the retail sector. Customers like to sample skin care and other products firsthand. They have to be in an Ulta location to get their hair or eyebrows done. Thus, analysts have argued, Ulta has some immunity to the threat of big online retailers like Amazon (AMZN).Walmart inched up 0.04% after the close, after finishing 1.9% lower, and was below its 50-day line. Amazon was unchanged after-hours. The stock finished the day up 0.3% to 1,629.62. Shares of Amazon are still within range of a handle in a cup base with a 1568.62 buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Ulta Beauty Shows Improved Relative Price Performance; Still Shy Of BenchmarkUlta Beauty, Amazon Take Strides In Each Other's DirectionUlta Beauty Gets Technical Rating Upgrade

13,ULTA,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP. It's the largest market share payments platform in the online world. It's growing quarterly sales north of 20% and earnings around 30%. It has strong ROE.

14,ULTA,"Walmart (WMT) is launching a $50-a-month platform called Jetblack, which lets consumers text personal shoppers and order items via text message. The retail giant announced the service at its annual shareholder meeting Thursday.The service, which originated from Walmart's Store No. 8 Incubator, was originally called Code Eight, according to Recode. The tech news outlet first reported on the service's initial December launch. The service was rebranded in mid-May as Jetblack, when it became available in beta mode in Manhattan.Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss heads the startup. Jetblack membership includes same-day or next-day white-glove delivery service, gift wrapping and returns. It's reportedly working with third-party couriers Deliv and Uber.Shoppers can text personal shoppers with requests for gift ideas, for example, and expect to receive photos of products they might be interested in and can then purchase via text.CNBC said the service will also offer products from Saks, Bluemercury, Pottery Barn and other retailers, in addition to Walmart.com and Jet.com items. According to Bloomberg, Fleiss said that current Jetblack members are ordering upward of 10 products a week, with thousands of people on a waitlist to join.Shares of Walmart fell 1.9% to 82.55 in the stock market today.As the retail footrace with Amazon (AMZN) continues, Walmart has been angling for more affluent, urban customers, notably through its acquisition and integration of Jet.com.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Ulta Beauty To Report Earnings Late As Estee Lauder Nears Buy PointInternet Giants Amazon, Alibaba Heading For Consumer Battle In IndiaStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

(HPQ), and Cree (CREE).Lawn- and garden-care company Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) also does business in hydroponics, or the practice of soil-less plant growing often used to grow marijuana. Scotts Miracle-Gro said Tuesday said it would buy Sunlight Supply, a large U.S. hydroponic distributor, for $450 million.But given the fragile, often patchwork state of marijuana regulations, the pot industry is still very volatile and drama-prone. Scotts Miracle-Gro stock collapsed in January after management said the ""slower-than-expected pace of regulatory changes in California"" was harming its hydroponics business.The LED company's products appear on lists of preferred indoor lighting options for growers with hydroponic set-ups. While LEDs carry higher up-front costs than other lights, they produce less heat and use up less electricity.Sure. Microsoft offers software that tracks cannabis sales for states that allow them via a partnership.HP will work with Flowhub, a developer of pot industry compliance software, to roll out cash-register terminals that have Flowhub's software.Marijuana-focused ETFs, like the ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), are among the exchange traded funds that track the cannabis industry.Alternative Harvest's holdings include stocks like GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), a company that makes seizure-fighting drugs containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a part of the cannabis plant that doesn't get you high but that typically has a relaxing effect. The fund also follows some of Canada's biggest publicly traded marijuana producers, like Aurora Cannabis and Cronos Group (CRON), which in February became the first pure-play pot stock to join the Nasdaq.AdvisorShares Vice ETF largely follows the booze and tobacco industry, but holdings with a marijuana stock aroma include Scotts Miracle-Gro and companies like Abbvie (ABBV), whose drug Marinol is made partly from synthetic cannabinoids.After years of indirectly targeting the appetites of pot enthusiasts, burger-and-taco chain Jack in the Box in December directly advertised to them.The company at that time partnered with Merry Jane, the cannabis website co-founded by Snoop Dogg, to launch a promotional munchie meal ""that commemorates the legalization of recreational cannabis in California,"" the website said.The meal, which cost $4.20, was available in select parts of the state. The chain said the partnership was ""one more way for us to connect"" with late-night customers.Cowen & Co. also said that pot legalization is good for the Jack in the Box, with the research firm singling it out as a top marijuana stock play in fast food.""Within quick-service, we note Jack in the Box has the greatest exposure to recreational marijuana use becoming more widely accepted in states that have already legalized use (10% of the store base), as well as 5 states with an upcoming legalized recreational use proposal on state ballots for the November election (52% of the store base),"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a report in September of 2016.""The latter is driven by 42% of the Jack store base that is located in California,"" he added.Cowen analysts in 2016 saw an opportunity for Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to expand its hemp-product offerings as customers gained a ""wider understanding"" of cannabis. Lotions infused with non-psychoactive cannabidiol are already available at dispensaries.

51,ULTA,"After posting a strong earnings report Thursday, cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) retook its prior buy point and got an upgrade to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 66 to 76.IBD's proprietary RS Rating tracks technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks compares to other publicly traded companies.History reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if Ulta Beauty can continue to show renewed price strength and clear that threshold.Ulta Beauty gapped up sharply Friday, enough to push it beyond a 289.37 - 303.84 buy zone. But it began giving back a portion of those gains and returned to the upper end of that range.While sales growth fell last quarter from 25% to 22%, the bottom line grew 41%, up from 33% in the previous report.Ulta Beauty earns the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Retail-Specialty industry group. Sotheby's (BID) and Luxottica (LUX) are also among the group's highest-rated stocks.RELATED:Four Takeaways From Ulta Beauty's Beat-And-Raise QuarterIBD Stock Rating Upgrades: Rising Relative StrengthWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

52,ULTA,"Techs commanded the downside but stocks continued to chip away at sharp morning losses in late trading Friday. The Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.4% and continued to trade well off its late-morning lows on Friday.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, lost less than 1% and held above a new buy point of 160.97 in a nearly eight-week cup with handle. Unlike some other leading tech stocks, the iPhone giant is also trading nicely above its 50-day moving average, a sign of strength.However, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Five Below (FIVE) joined the downside following quarterly results. The former triggered sell signals in June and early July by caving below the 50-day moving average and then soon driving below the long-term 200-day moving average in ferocious volume, two important sell signals. The latter is still in good shape after breakouts from two buy points.At 3:40 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq, down as much as 1.5% early, shaved that decline to less than a third of that, while the Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF gave up 0.3%.Oil stocks advanced on a nice rally by U.S. crude futures, which hit $58 a barrel, and lent support to other major indexes. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average whittled their drop to around 0.2%. At 24,299, the Dow Jones industrial average looks poised to gain 2.8% for the week.Volume was running higher on both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday as Wall Street awaits the results of a Senate vote on a transformative tax reform package. Earlier, stocks sold off on news that former National Security advisor Michael Flynn struck a plea deal in which he could provide damaging testimony on President Trump's administration.At Thursday's close of 61.77, Five Below was up nearly 14% from a five-month cup base with a 54.23 buy point. The small cap firm is also up nearly 7% past a narrow flat base with a 57.75 entry. Shares rose to as high as 63.26 on Friday. Make sure you do not buy more than 5% extended past the latest 57.75 entry point. Buying within the 5% chase zone allows an investor to sit tight even when a stock decides to pull back to or near the proper buy point.If you buy too far above the proper entry, the chances are much higher that you may need to execute the golden rule of investing.Five Below's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group ranks 68th among 197 industry groups and subgroups rated each day for relative six-month price performance by IBD. In general, the biggest stock market winners hail from the top 20 to 40 industry groups. However, Five Below's group has jumped to its current spot from No. 102 four weeks ago, a good sign.The Philadelphia-based company now operates more than 600 stores in 32 states. It has zero long-term debt and expanded its shareholders equity to $381 million vs. $288 million in the year-ago period.Five Below also forecast sales of $491 million to $503 million for the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter, well above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $484.1 million. Executives also see earnings of $1.09 to $1.16 a share, or up 21% to 29%.Going back to Apple, the mega-cap tech with a market value of $877 billion has stretched its gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good cup with handle and a 160.97 buy point to as much as 8.4% three weeks ago before easing back. The gain for Apple from latest correct buy point is now back to around 6%.The iPhone giant has also risen 45% since marking a breakout from a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. At that time, Apple also cleared a cup with handle, shoving past a 118.12 entry.Improving fundamentals are behind Apple's stunning turnaround in the stock market this year.The company has shown improving fundamentals over the past 12 months, and the Street appears confident that the turnaround will continue. Over the next two quarters, analysts on consensus see earnings growing 12% and 39%. That would extend Apple's streak of double-digit EPS growth to five straight quarters.Revenue increases are helping drive those positive expectations.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, Apple's sales slumped 9%. After that, revenue turned around, rising 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the next four quarters. Apple is now seen growing the top line 10% in the current first quarter (ending in December) to $86.18 billion, then another 30% to $68.77 billion in Q2 of fiscal 2018.Strong orders for the ultra-luxury iPhone X, a major iPhone replacement cycle, strength in digital services, increasing popularity of the cellular-enabled Apple Watch, and other products are helping continue Apple's dominance in consumer electronics.Apple's stock price strength also is improving. According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Relative Price Strength Rating is a respectable 80 on a scale of 1 (weak) to 99 (strong), up sharply since scoring a 59 on Jan. 1.Meanwhile, Apple's EPS Rating has improved to a solid 90 (also on a scale of 1 to 99), up from 45 on Jan. 1. The SMR Rating, which analyzes sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, is at a top-shelf A on a scale of A to E.In the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, Apple's aftertax margin rose 120 basis points to 20.4%, indicating strong pricing power of its products as well as likely hinting at improved operating leverage or cost efficiencies.RELATED:GOP Has Votes For Tax Bill, McConnell Says; S&P 500 Pares Flynn LossesFlynn Admits To Lying, Says Trump Team Ordered Russia OutreachHow Are Stocks In The IBD 50 Doing?Finding Great New IPO Stocks: Who Are The Next Cisco, Google, Home Depot?

Red-hot Chinese social media and live-streaming video app Momo (MOMO) cooled off despite crushing views.At its meeting Thursday, OPEC extended production cuts through March 2018 but didn't deepen output curbs as some had speculated, while keeping Libya and Nigeria exempt for the foreseeable future even as their output rises. Oil prices tumbled 4.8% that day, wiping out gains made in the weeks leading up to the meeting. On Wednesday, EIA data showed U.S. oil inventories fell for the seventh consecutive week, while production rebounded from its first dip in three months. After a Friday rebound, U.S. crude futures closed the week down 1.8% to $49.80 a barrel.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) posted a beat-and-raise Q1 that surpassed expectations, sending shares jumping to an all-time high Friday.

Investors shrugged off the news that Take-Two is delaying its highly anticipated Wild West shooter game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall.

That's highly unusual, to say the least, given the pummeling that department stores and many other mall-based chains have gotten.Dillon said she was ""particularly proud of these results in light of the challenging environment many retailers are experiencing.""And that isn't expected to stop anytime soon.""We believe the momentum has legs to continue through FY17 and beyond,"" wrote Cowen's Chen of Ulta's same-store sales.E-commerce sales jumped 70.9% during the quarter, which Piper Jaffray says is Ulta's highest level since 2014.

""The number of online-only shoppers is very low, but omnichannel shoppers continue to increase, up 140 bps y/y to 8.6%.""Total traffic growth during the quarter rose 77% as mobile traffic popped 107%.IT Cosmetics, Tarte, Too Faced, Mario Badescu, Becca, Anastasia, Clinique, Lancome, Benefit, Tonymoly, Yes Too, and the Ulta Beauty collection were among the quarter's top performing brands, said Dillon.Clinique is owned by Estee Lauder (EL), and the cosmetics giant recently acquired Becca and Too Faced as well. Last year, Estee Lauder debuted the millennial-focused Estee Edit at Sephora. J.C. Penney (JCP) has a number of Sephora store-within-a-store operations.""Growth in Ulta and Sephora is positive for Estee as it diversifies sales from weaker channels like midtier department stores"" said Stifel's Mark Astrachan.RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Fell Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of Earnings

AT&T actually lost 390,000 pay-TV customers, but added 300,000 internet video subscribers, partially offsetting the loss. UBS estimated that the pay-TV industry will lose about 1 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with 325,000 in the same quarter last year. It's a worry for media companies because they garner per-subscriber programming fees.AT&T tumbled 7.5% to 35.70, dropping below the ""collar"" in its proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX).

66,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has all the trimmings of a retail rock star: It routinely tops earnings and sales forecasts, posts double-digit same-store sales growth and continues to gain market share.XThe specialty beauty chain missed comp guidance slightly (11.7% vs. estimates for 12%) and its Q3 profit outlook came in light, but management also raised profit guidance for the year and raised the low end of its full-year same-store sales outlook.Any other retailer would likely be lauded for such a beat-and-raise quarter. (See Thursday's retail rally: Even after paring gains, Signet Jeweler's (SIG) surprise venture into positive comp territory helped shares rise 16.7% for the day.)But Ulta shares are getting slammed the morning after, gapping down 10% to a 15-month low of 209.32 in the stock market today, more than 30% off their recent all-time high of 314.86 in early June. And some analysts are cutting their price targets.So what gives?Calling Ulta ""one of the most controversial names under (our) coverage despite generating the strongest growth profile in our space,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow pointed to its ""very strong"" same-store sales growth that nonetheless missed targets for the first time since Q3 2013 — providing an imperfection for investors to obsess over, particularly as Amazon (AMZN) becomes a hotter topic than it has been in the past.""While this seems explainable (traded sales for margin, GMs beat plan) it creates a hole for investors to poke at as the concerns around slowing beauty category trends, a more competitive (department) store backdrop and the looming Amazon unknown all remain top of mind,"" he wrote.Amazon hasn't traditionally been a pressing worry for beauty names for the following reasons: Sephora and Ulta each have a hold over loyal repeat customers, beauty shopping requires some degree of in-person sampling, and Amazon isn't known for having a strong selection of prestige cosmetics and skin-care brands. Estee Lauder (EL) management said in its most recent earnings call that it has no plans to distribute on Amazon in fiscal 2018.But recent reports that high-end beauty retailers like Violet Grey could partner with Amazon, and the acquiescence of major brands like Nike (NKE) (and perhaps La-Z-Boy (LZB)) to sell their wares directly on the e-commerce titan, might be contributing to concerns that the floodgates could soon open.Add to that reports of beauty-product discounting from major department stores and Ulta's own slowing sales growth, and the worry is more apparent.IBD'S TAKE: Holding or buying stocks into quarterly reports is risky. But here's an earnings options strategy that significantly reduces risk while letting you capitalize on big post-earnings gains.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan lowered his price target to 240 from 270, and said Ulta is likely to trade lower in the near term ""given broader multiple contraction amongst retail stocks, slowing growth, and fears of increased competition from Amazon."" He has a hold rating on Ulta.But not everyone is worried.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, who rates the stock an outperform, believes Ulta is ""expensive, worth it, and can hold its own"" against Amazon, highlighting its 25.4 million rewards program members, 15.3% salon sales growth and attractive product assortment.And Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said management countered concerns over Amazon by ""citing strong velocity in key overlapping categories of investor concern.""Nevertheless, she cut her price target to 260 from 330, and is ""rethinking our valuation paradigm for ULTA shares given ongoing industry/consumer changes."" She has an overweight rating on Ulta.""The issue here is valuation,"" wrote Wells Fargo's Boruchow, ""as we feel the stock will have difficulty achieving multiple expansion in the face of slowing category dynamics, a deceleration comp trend and macro concerns (namely Amazon).""RELATED:Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchMacy's Hits 7-Year Low, Ulta Slices 200-Day As Beauty Gets OldHere Are The Winners And Losers From Amazon's Reported Violet Grey Deal As La-Z-Boy Eyes Amazon, Williams-Sonoma's Online Growth Tops Retail

70,ULTA,"Buyers had the upper hand again in afternoon trading Thursday as the major stock indexes hit all-time highs on an intraday basis.The Nasdaq composite added 0.7%, the S&P 500 picked up 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%. Volumes on the NYSE and Nasdaq were tracking about 10% higher than Wednesday's levels.Retail-related groups outperformed, with seven groups in IBD's database up 1.6% or more.

Shares of Netflix soared nearly 4% to a new high after Piper Jaffray maintained an overweight rating but lifted its price target to 190 from 166. Chipotle added 1% after Argus upgraded the fast-casual restaurant chain to buy with a 550 price target. Chipotle has been trading tightly near highs, just above the 10-week moving average after a base breakout in late March.Elsewhere, Best Buy (BBY) was the star of the day, soaring 20% to 60.40 on strong earnings. On Wednesday, a weekly call option with 51.50 strike price (May 26 expiration) came with a premium of around $2, offering a trade with 3.9% downside risk, within the preferred range of 4% or less.

Shares are up nearly 13% so far this week after a breakout from a cup-shaped base with a 136.10 buy point. Keep in mind that the stock has made a big move over the past four weeks.

It's extended now.Elsewhere in retail, Costco (COST) gapped up and rose nearly 2% to 177.97 on an earnings beat. Costco recently pulled back to the 50-day moving average but never triggered a sell signal from a 178.81 buy point, meaning the buy point is still intact.In the biotech space, recent Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) showed bullish action around its 50-day moving average, soaring nearly 5%. Earlier this week, the company announced plans to buy privately held True North for around $400 million, plus an additional $425 million in potential milestone payments. Bioverativ is basically Biogen's global hemophilia business, but it also sees opportunities as a rare blood disorder specialist.Turnaround story Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) was on pace for its seven straight gain after reporting earnings late Thursday.

75,ULTA,"X A brutal retail earnings season walloped department stores and knocked around the shares of all but a few major names, such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), as retail's ongoing existential crisis flails on.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which reports late Thursday, is something of an outlier, with consistent quarterly beats and double-digit same-store sales growth at a time when other stores are posting declines or mild single-digit gains.Shares have generally made modest moves, with the stock rising in line with the S&P 500 over the last nine months. But Ulta has had big swings in the session following after-the-close earnings reports, with shares getting punished for two of the last three quarters, even when the retailer has posted a beat-and-raise quarter.Investors are extra jittery this time around: Ahead of Thursday's results, shares fell 3.5% to 280.51 in the stock market today on a downgrade to hold from buy from Edward Jones, diving below their 289.37 buy point. Before Wednesday's tumble, Ulta stock has nearly doubled since February of last year to an all-time high of 301.40 in early May, with shares testing the 300 price mark in recent weeks.""While we expect profit margins still have some room to expand, we do believe it will become more difficult over the longer term as more business shifts to online,"" wrote Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones. ""Online sales have lower profit margins than sales in the stores.""He otherwise sounded positive on the company, calling it ""one of the most compelling growth stories in the retail landscape due to its store-growth opportunity and because it operates in an attractive industry and has the potential to realize further profit expansion.""For Q1, profit is expected to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on a 19% revenue rise to $1.27 billion. Expect laser-focus on same-store sales growth, a closely watched metric in the retail space.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, who rates the stock overweight, expects 11.5% in comparable-sales growth, a tick higher than Street views.IBD'S TAKE: Need a refresher? Ulta Beauty has reported same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. Consensus is for 11% comp growth in Q1, says Piper Jaffray. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the Amazon Effect.Like off-price stores, the beauty sector frequently gets a call-out for being impervious to Amazon's (AMZN) offensive tactics in the retail sphere. Experts chalk it up to the in-store experience, the test-and-trial nature of beauty products and robust rewards programs, among other factors.Murphy cited confidence in Ulta's loyalty program and indicated that Ulta is likely to benefit from the decline of department stores, noting that only J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nordstrom (JWN) are notching cosmetic sales gains. Plus, the firm's biannual teen survey revealed that Ulta was gaining ""considerable share"" as a go-to shopping hot spot.J.C. Penney in particular has benefited from its Sephora shops-in-shops, and said earlier in the month that it will open another 16 in-store Sephoras in June, with plans to open 70 new locations of the upscale makeup retailer in 2017. That will bring its end-of-year total to 650 shops, in 75% of all J.C. Penney stores.Ulta Beauty offered up light Q1 guidance in March. But that doesn't worry some analysts.""Ulta has beaten its sales guidance in all but one quarter since (the first quarter of 2010) as one of the best guiders we cover,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel in March, following the company's most recent earnings report.

77,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares sliced through their 50-day moving average and tumbled right out of buy range intraday Wednesday, after getting a downgrade to hold from buy from Edward Jones. It believes Ulta's earnings growth should continue at an above-average pace but that opportunities for profit margin expansion are slowing.""While we expect profit margins still have some room to expand, we do believe it will become more difficult over the longer term as more business shifts to online,"" wrote Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones. ""Online sales have lower profit margins than sales in the stores.""Shares of Ulta were down 3.5% to 280.51 on the stock market today, undercutting their 289.37 entry just one day ahead of the specialty beauty retailer's earnings report after the close Thursday.Beauty products maker Estee Lauder (EL) edged up 1.1% to 93.03, nearing a 94.57 buy point, while e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) slipped 0.8% to 24.85. Estee Lauder soared following its earnings report earlier this month, while e.l.f. Beauty fell sharply.Prior to this tumble, Ulta had been climbing toward the 300 price level. By early May, shares had doubled from February 2016, hitting an all-time high of 301.40.Beauty products are a particular sweet spot in retail, and stores like Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora have flourished despite the broader shopping trends that have spelled gloom for other stores.When Ulta reports Q1 results Thursday, profit is expected to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on a 19% revenue rise to $1.27 billion. Expect laser-focus on same-store sales growth, a closely watched metric in the retail space.Consensus is for 11% growth, according to Piper Jaffray. Double-digit same-store sales growth is something of an anomaly, as other retailers turn in declines or mild single-digit comps.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty has reported same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters.

Amazon edged up 0.1%American Airlines was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Cowen and had its price target raised to 57 from 55.Cowen analyst Helane Becker said the airline's outlook for next year was ""compelling"" as the company segments more of its products.

79,ULTA,"Known retail disruptor Amazon.com (AMZN) is at it again, reportedly.WWD said Wednesday, citing market sources, that online cosmetics-retailer Violet Grey could partner with Amazon to sell its luxury brands through the e-commerce behemoth.Violet Grey was founded in 2013 by Cassandra Grey, the wife of late ex-Paramount Pictures CEO Brad Grey. The company has a brick-and-mortar presence on Melrose Place in Los Angeles, offering ""expertly curated beauty products and exclusive offerings, all tested and approved by Hollywood's leading hairstylists, skin care experts, and makeup artists.""X Its e-commerce site features photo shoots with celebrities such as ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke and stories like ""Lessons on Hair Volume"" and ""Violette's Rules of Foundation.""Why does it matter? The news of Violet Grey's potential deal with Amazon is likely what's weighing on specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) in the stock market today. Ulta fell 3.65% to 247.24, hitting a fresh 2017 low intraday as shares continue their downward trajectory from early June.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, who wrote that he was ""unsurprised"" by the report, called a potential Amazon-Violet Grey deal a ""negative for retailers, including Ulta and Sephora, and to (a) lesser extent department stores, which rely on beauty to drive foot traffic.""Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and peers certainly have their own troubles, and a recent Wall Street Journal report — on department stores discounting prestige beauty products — sent Macy's shares to a seven-year low. J.C. Penney (JCP) has seen beauty sales grow, thanks to its Sephora shop-in-shops.One small online beauty retailer getting the backing of Amazon doesn't pose an imminent threat to cosmetics stores or retailers that carry makeup and skin care. The worry, though, is what it indicates about Amazon's interest in entering the space — and how hard the e-commerce heavy will pummel away once it has something in its cross hairs.Grocery stores, after all, could tell its counterparts in beauty a thing or two.Estee Lauder (EL) and L'Oreal-owned brands are also sold on Violet Grey.""We ultimately think it makes sense for companies such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal, and LVMH to offer a limited assortment of prestige beauty brands for sale on Amazon, given the substantial shift in consumer shopping behavior online,"" said Astrachan.He thinks the owners of brands sold on Violet Grey would have right of refusal to sell on Amazon, but if a deal were to happen, ""we would anticipate the independent brands would be most likely to embrace Amazon, with a likely far-more-limited assortment of larger brands being offered for sale in time.""Estee Lauder shares rose 0.2% intraday to 98.92. The stock is at the edge of the buy zone from a 94.57 cup-with-handle base entry point.Prestige beauty brands keep a tight cap on distribution in order to assert control over pricing and brand image. But this news and e-commerce focus is ""modestly favorable"" to both L'Oreal and Estee Lauder, said Astrachan, especially since a broader online presence would ease Estee Lauder's reliance on mid-tier department stores for its sales.... Exactly what kind of impact Amazon is looking to make on the beauty space. And it might be too early to panic, says one expert.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said that Violet Grey's estimated revenue is ""well below"" $5 million a year (while noting Ulta's market cap has taken a $550 million hit so far Wednesday), and that it has a ""tiny"" social-media presence compared to Ulta and Estee Lauder. But it does have ""decent"" traction with celebrities, she said.And according to Piper Jaffray, Violet Grey carries 130 brands, mostly skin care and cosmetics. But only 15 of the brands overlap with Ulta's offerings, such as Dior, Giorgio Armani, MAC and others.""Bottom line, while we recognize the ""headline"" risk of seeing AMZN & any category (in this case, beauty) in the same line, we don't see a near-term risk for the beauty category being disintermediated by Amazon at this juncture,"" wrote Murphy.She has an overweight rating and 330 price target on Ulta Beauty.Amazon, meanwhile, rose 1.2% to 1,052.80, hitting a record high but in buy range from a 1,016,60 entry.

82,ULTA,"The major averages turned in a narrowly mixed finish Tuesday after weak company earnings and strong economic news left stocks battling to a stalemate.X The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1% despite the day's powerful performance by Apple (AAPL). The S&P 500 slipped a fraction into the red, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended the session clinging to a faint gain.Preliminary data showed overall volume was quiet, lower on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq relative to Monday's action.Stocks received some positive strokes from economic news, with better-than-expected July retail sales growth and a surge in New York region manufacturing. Growth in business inventories outpaced estimates for June, and the National Association of Homebuilders' Home Price Index rebounded to 28 in August, a three-month high.That may have helped Apple pull off its 1.1% gain, while among FANG names, Facebook (FB) rose 0.15%.

The loss sent shares below their 10-week moving average in heavy trade, triggering a sell signal.Among the few winners to rise on earnings results, China-based Holisys Automation Technology (HOLI) churned out a 5.4% gain, despite a weak fiscal fourth-quarter report late Monday.

84,ULTA,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

87,ULTA,"A few eyebrows might have been raised when Ulta Beauty (ULTA) recently gave up support at its 50-day moving average and longer-term support at the 200-day line.Why would institutional investors be selling the stock amid healthy fundamentals and strong growth prospects?Ulta offered hints that a pullback was possible after the stock hit a series of new highs in light volume when it cleared a flat base in early May (1). There's plenty of market precedent that shows that a pattern of new highs in light volume is a sign that a stock may be ready to take a breather — and that it's time to begin selling shares to nail down profits. It basically signals that buying demand is drying up.A sequence of new highs in light volume isn't automatically a death sentence for a stock, but it is a yellow flag, especially for those investors with a nice gain.Shares gapped up powerfully May 26 after the company reported another strong quarter, but a 5.8% intraday gain was nearly halved as shares rose 3%. It wasn't a bad day for Ulta, but the price action showed that sellers were around despite news of the company's seventh straight quarter of 20%+ sales growth.Ulta rose for five straight sessions after that, in lukewarm turnover (2) that paled compared with the pair of high-volume sell-offs that took place a week earlier. Shares slumped 2% on June 6 in higher turnover, a negative sign. Then, over the next 12 sessions, five days of declines in higher volume vs. the prior session indicated that there had been more institutional selling. Ulta eventually gave up the 50-day moving average (3) and its 200-day line (4).After a low volume bounce off the 200-day moving average July 7, big sellers were in the stock again for the next two sessions.Ulta has been a big winner since the start of bull market in March 2009. But with shares up more than 3,500%, serious questions now remain about the stock's ability to be a market leader again. Even a positive note Friday from Goldman Sachs wasn't much help for the stock. Early Friday, the stock gave back more than half of a 3.9% intraday gain.The bull camp will point toward solid annual earnings estimates, high return on equity and an outstanding management team. The bears will argue that growth fund managers have been taking profits lately and Ulta's run as a market leader could be ending.Part of Ulta's weakness is attributable to overall softness in the retail sector. Since June 1, the specialty retail industry group is down more than 10% compared to a mild gain of roughly 1.5% for the S&P 500.It's too early to say that Ulta's run is completely over. The stock recently corrected about 20% off its high — not unreasonable after a big price move. Chart patterns that have yielded powerful breakouts throughout market history have shown declines of up to 30% to 33%, and sometimes even more, as these bullish patterns form.RELATED:Investor's Corner: Multiple Sell Signals Can Occur At The Same TimeInvestor's Corner: How To Use The 10-Week Moving Average To Lock In ProfitsHow To Make Money In Stocks: First, Know The Market's Primary DirectionTrading ETFs And Making Money: How Does IBD's ETF Market Timing Work?

Kohl's is near a recent 52-week low. Nordstrom (JWN) tumbled 2.7% to 46.24.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sank through its 200-day line for the first time in 16 months. Ulta fell 2.9% to 268.82, continuing a downward march from a recent all-time high of 314.86 in early June.Specialty beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora have typically been regarded as Amazon (AMZN)-resistant companies, immune to the promotional downward spiral facing apparel sellers and the woes befalling Macy's and other department stores. Both also have strong rewards programs that court shoppers' loyalty.But Monday's story in the Journal, while not indicative of greater discounting at Ulta or Sephora, may point to concerns over potential ripple effects. It is unclear how much pressure specialty beauty retailers would experience should heavy cosmetics discounting at department stores become widespread.Estee Lauder (EL), a prestige brand found at major department stores (and to a certain degree at Ulta and Sephora), fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. Shares closed off session lows, losing just 1 cent to 94.27, but that's below the rising support line.Estee Lauder cleared a 94.57 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May, rising as high as 98.40.

92,ULTA,"The major indexes struggled with less than half an hour remaining in Thursday's session, setting up the likelihood of significant losses in the July 4th holiday-shortened week. Meanwhile, numerous growth leaders are showing a greater probability that new bases or base-on-base patterns will form.XChipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), Netflix (NFLX,) Nvidia (NVDA) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) all showed interesting chart action. Nvidia is finding buying support at the 10-week moving average, while Broadcom is looking to regain its 10-week line.Online video streaming giant Netflix is off 0.9% to 146.28 in light volume, but shares are now 12% below the 52-week peak of 166.87. Such a drop indicates there's a good chance that the current market leader, which broke out of a deep first-stage cup near 111.95 during the week ended Oct. 21, 2016, is going to fashion a new base pattern.Nvidia, the premier player in data-crunching circuits for AI, self-driving technology, video game hardware and the datacenter, has scratched out a small gain, up 0.3% to 143.47 in below-average turnover, and is trying to hold above its key 50-day line.Netflix and Ulta, meanwhile, have already taken out their 10-week moving averages, indicating that a more substantial correction is in the works. Watch to see on a weekly chart whether they test their longer-term 40-week lines, which behave similarly to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart.Ulta's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is currently at a worst-possible E on a scale of A to E, meaning that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been net sellers in the consumer-spending and retail play.  The cosmetics, hair and personal care products seller is expected to stretch its long record of solid double-digit EPS growth in the current July-ending fiscal second quarter with a 24% jump in earnings to $1.78 a share.Apple (AAPL) was among at least seven companies within the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average to sink 1 point or more as the blue-chip index fell around 0.7% at with less than 30 minutes to go on Wall Street.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite fared slightly worse, dropping 0.9% to 1.1%.The small-cap Russell 2000 fell more than 1.4%, which would be its biggest decline since a 2.8% walloping on May 17. Volume was edging slightly higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly even on the NYSE.IBD's current outlook for the market has been ""uptrend under pressure"" since June 27, when the Nasdaq notched its fifth distribution day in recent weeks.Apparel, automaker, department store chain, discount retailer, hospital, medical services, generic drug and oil drilling stocks led the market's downside with losses of 1.8% or more Thursday. Breadth was negative on both main exchanges.Apple, off 0.9% at 142.73 saw volume fall around 19% below its 50-day average, continues to spend more time beneath its 10-week moving average, which would become more problematic for current holders if the stock spends at least eight to nine weeks beneath that line. However, the iPhone giant is still holding on to the lion's share of its 32.5% gain from a Jan. 6-9 breakout from an early-stage cup with handle at 118.12.Keep in mind that Apple is still miles above its rising 200-day moving average, and the company itself continues to innovate with new products and services as it transitions away from a pure high-growth firm into more of a growth and income play.The 1.7% annualized yield trails the S&P 500's 1.9% yield, but Apple's cash payout is growing rapidly. The stock's 12-month Relative Price Rating of 84, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, remains leadership-quality.In other financial markets, investors continued to exit U.S. Treasuries, as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 2.38%. Gold edged up 0.2% to $1,224 a troy ounce. U.S. crude oil futures gained nearly 0.5% to $45.29 a barrel.RELATED:Why Did This Dow Jones 30 Component Plunge To A 19-Month Low?The Income Investor: This Dividend-Rich Consumer Play Has It AllWhere Is The Market Headed?

98,ULTA,"Now that earnings season is upon us again, what better time to take a refresher course on the importance of a solid earnings track record?Buying stocks during this time can be especially tricky, since an upside or downside surprise in a company's earnings report can send its stock sharply higher or lower. So too can a notable acceleration or slowdown in growth vs. the same year-ago period. It's no coincidence that two of the letters in the CAN SLIM investing system represent earnings: C for current earnings, and A for annual earnings.There are many other fundamental and technical criteria to consider before buying any stock, but the year-over-year percentage gain in earnings per share is still the most important factor to potential success in investing, on both a quarterly and annual basis.""A standout stock needs both a sound growth record in recent years and a strong current earnings record in the last several quarters,"" IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""It's the powerful combination of these two critical factors, rather than one or the other, that creates a super stock, or at least one that has a higher chance for true success.""That's where the Earnings Per Share Rating comes into play. IBD's proprietary metric studies the two most recent quarters of earnings growth and the three-year growth rate. The result is compared with all other stocks and assigned a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) rating. A 99 EPS Rating means the company outperformed 99% of all others.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about the importance of earnings growth as well as where to find the EPS Rating, read this Investor's Corner column.Take Ulta Beauty (ULTA), for example. The Illinois-based beauty store operator owns a streak of quarterly double-digit earnings gains spanning more than four years. Growth has held at 22% or better the past 11 quarters, with analysts expecting a 24% increase in both the current and next quarter.Now let's take a look at its annual profits. Ulta's three-year earnings growth rate is 27%. Consensus estimates call for a 24% gain for the January-ending fiscal year and 21% in fiscal 2019.The beauty chain's annual EPS has risen 20% or more each year for the past eight years. It has a 98 EPS Rating.The stock's overall performance has been stellar too. It's hit some bumps along the way, but has ramped up more than 67 times from its March 2009 low.When Ulta broke out of a cup pattern at 188.58 with a 17% gap up in quadruple-normal volume on March 11, 2016, earnings per share jumped 22%, 22% and 27% in the prior three quarters. The breakout, in fact, came the day after Ulta reported that 27% EPS gain.Ulta remains in buy range from a recent 274.09 buy point. It's up 133% from an October 2014 breakout from a cup with handle. That includes a 38% advance last year vs. a 7.5% gain for the Nasdaq composite.RELATED:Strong Profit Growth Just One Highlight Of This Top Stock In Buy Range Claiming A Beautiful Niche In A Troubled Retail TradeHow To Invest I: Why The Price-To-Earnings Ratio Is Useless For High-Growth InvestorsHow To Invest II: Spotting The Correct Buy Point And Knowing When To Reset The Base CountHow To Invest III: How To Use The 10-Week Moving Average To Find New Buy Points

101,ULTA,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday. For the latest on FANG stocks, check out IBD's hub on all things Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Nike, Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY), PVH (PVH), Ralph Lauren, and Hanes Brands (HBI), which have wide wholesale distribution to department stores ""could stand to gain the most from syncing up with the Amazon machine, as the site's success could provide a new form of wholesale distribution, offering some protection from the structural challenges facing the current establishment,"" Siegel added.Furthermore, he said wider apparel distribution on Amazon would actually help to bolster full-price retail and thereby protect off-pricers like TXJ and Ross Stores.RELATED:Wal-Mart Is Not Mulling A Rival Bid For Whole Foods: ReportHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety Attack

104,ULTA,"X Stock futures early Thursday morning indicated record highs for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite at the opening bell.S&P 500 futures rose 0.3% above fair value. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.35%. U.S. crude oil futures reversed from overnight highs near $52 to fall almost 1% to below $51 a barrel after Saudi Arabia said an expected output cut extension at Thursday's OPEC meeting would not involve deeper production reductions.On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite rose to within 0.1% of all-time intraday highs as the Federal Reserve signaled a go-slow approach for paring its massive balance sheet. The Dow Jones industrial average is within 1% of all-time highs. The S&P 500 actually set a record closing high. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time intraday best, with FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) hitting all-time highs and Facebook (FB) climbing more than 1%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.8% while China's Shanghai composite gained 1.4%.In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE and Germany's Dax climbed 0.1% while France's CAC-40 rose 0.3%.Recent tech unicorn MuleSoft (MULE) broke out of an initial IPO base on Wednesday, while much-hyped Snap (SNAP) traded near lows. First Solar (FSLR) cleared an entry point as well after a long downturn.MuleSoft shares shot up 8.7% to a record closing high of 25.70, clearing a 24.98 buy point above a handle in an IPO base.MuleSoft — which helps companies integrate their applications, data, and devices — came public at 17 a share in mid-March. Shares shot up 46% in its trading debt, hitting its still-intraday peak of 25.92.MuleSoft is a good example of why investors should wait for new IPOs to form and break out of an IPO base or other bullish consolidation before jumping in.Snap is an even better example, because the Snapchat operator has never presented a proper buying opportunity. Snap, which also came public at 17 in March, had a strong debut and second day of trading. But then the stock fell sharply.Heading into earnings, Snap was starting to show some positive signs but was still not close to a buy zone. Then Snap reported a wider loss and slower user growth than expected, as much-larger Facebook successfully clones popular Snapchat features.First Solar leapt 6.7% to 38.90, hitting a six-month high and clearing a bottoming base with a 37.77 buy point.

The Journal reported that Express and American Eagle were among the possible suitors.Shares of Abercrombie jumped 5.7% to 12.89 in the stock market today. American Eagle Outfitters, which sank to a near three-year low last week, rose 2.3%.

107,ULTA,"X Stocks pulled off a positive finish Friday, leaving the major indexes lower for the week, but with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 reclaiming key levels of support.An afternoon rally snapped after news reports said federal investigators had identified a current White House official as a person of significant interest in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Another report attributed to President Trump potentially damaging statements regarding the firing of FBI Director James Comey.Despite the mild pullback, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each ended 0.7% higher. That left the S&P 500 above the 50-day line, and the Dow even with the 50-day moving average and down about a half-percent for the week.The Nasdaq, which has remained above its 50-day line, took a 0.5% gain Friday and chalked up a 0.6% decline for the week.

108,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares are up big in late trade following a beat-and-raise quarter and better-than-expected double-digit same-store sales gains.Estimates: Profit to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on 19% revenue growth to $1.27 billion. Same-store sales to rise 11%.Results: $1.91 EPS on net sales of $1.31 billion. Same-store sales of 14.3%, including retail comps of 10.9%.Outlook: Ulta boosted full-year guidance to 9%-11% in same-store sales growth, up from prior guidance for 8%-10% comps. It sees mid-20s percent range EPS growth vs. prior outlook for low-20s. E-commerce sales growth is now expected to be in the 50% range vs. 40%.Stock: Shares jumped in late trade, up as much 6% and well over the 300 mark after the closing bell. Shares rose 4.5% to 293.04 on the stock market today, retaking their 289.37 buy point earlier, after Wednesday's dive sent shares below their 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty logged same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the ""Amazon effect,"" say experts.The retail sector looks cringe-worthy and investors are looking for bright spots. Those have typically come in the form of off-price chains like TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) (the latter of which is popping Thursday on results), and beauty specialists like LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora and Ulta Beauty.Meanwhile, Amazon.com (AMZN)-related worries and poor same-store sales growth at department stores are wreaking their usual havoc on the sector this quarter.RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Fell Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of EarningsAnother Wild Ride From Ulta Beauty After Earnings?

109,ULTA,"X Major stock indexes showed modest gains in afternoon trading Wednesday ahead of the release of the minutes from the May 2-3 Fed meeting at 2 p.m. ET.The market is expecting another rate hike at the June meeting, but Wall Street could get more color on the Fed's plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Liquidating holdings would be another form of a rate hike.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were up by 0.1% to 0.2%. Volume on the Nasdaq in the stock market today was tracking about 10% lower than Tuesday's level. NYSE volume was tracking close to Tuesday.Goldman Sachs (GS) and McDonald's (MCD) outperformed in the Dow with gains of more than 1%.Western Digital (WDC) was a solid gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up nearly 3%, after published reports said the company offered to buy Toshiba's chip unit for $17.8 billion. Western Digital is testing support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a base breakout in late March.Oil eased 0.5% to $51.21 a barrel Wednesday despite data from the Energy Information Administration showing the seventh straight weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies. That news was offset by a recommendation by a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee on Wednesday to extend output cuts agreed upon in December for nine months.Inside the IBD 50, Stamps.com (STMP) continued work on the right side of a cup-shaped base as shares jumped 5%. It reset its base count last year when shares hit a low of 68.82 in July. That means its current base is first stage.Also in the IBD 50, China-based YY (YY) also outperformed, rising 3%. It's still in buy range from a 56.31 cup-with-handle buy point, although a lagging relative strength line raises some concern about the viability of the breakout.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gave up its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Shares slumped nearly 4% after Edward Jones downgraded the beauty retailer to hold from buy.Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) also reports Thursday after the close. Despite several quarters in a row of declining sales, it's a reasonable candidate for a call-option trade ahead of earnings as it works on a base with a 16.82 buy point.When shares were trading around 16.25, a weekly call option with a 16.50 strike price (May 26 expiration) came with a premium of 50 cents, offering a trade with downside risk of just 3%. The right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Marvell at 16.50 came at a cost of just $50.

110,ULTA,"To the ever-expanding list of Things Uber Is Disrupting, add malls and their parking lots.At Macy's (M) investor day on Tuesday, Doug Sesler, executive vice president for real estate, suggested that the increased use of Uber had led to a decrease in the need for the vast stretches of land reserved for mall-customer parking.""We're all talking about driverless cars, we're talking about the increased use of Uber,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is we don't need the massive parking lots that we needed in the 1970s.""Macy's has been bruised by retail's woes in the era of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT). It's thrown a variety of ideas at the wall to make use of its stripped-out floor space and 130-plus million square feet of real estate, and half-filled parking lots could offer a new option.Sesler said that when Macy's owns store space, they also typically own parking space with it. He said those swaths of pavement can be used for other retail space – a Starbucks (SBUX) at the corner of a parking lot, he suggested – or residential, office or hotel space.The company has formed an alliance with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), a real estate company, to look at different ways to use its stretches of real estate.Macy's has also considered bolting restaurants onto the outside of its big-box locations to generate traffic and add atmosphere and rental income. The company has put office space above its stores in Seattle and is marketing the upper portion of its State Street flagship store in Chicago, where it hopes to make similar conversions to office space.The company is overhauling its large Union Square location in San Francisco to create 10,000 square feet for small shops across the front – space the company has just started to market for rent, Sesler said. In New York, the company said it is looking at ways to jumpstart shopper traffic in its Herald Square flagship – possibly with an indoor-and-outdoor rooftop area featuring restaurants and after-work hangouts.IBD'S TAKE: As Amazon and off-price retailers wear down department stores, retailers like Ulta Beauty have gotten by relatively unscathed. Here are five takeaways from Ulta's most recent quarterly earnings. What's more, Sesler said, Macy's department stores are in 72% of the nation's high-end 'A' malls — those most likely to weather the ongoing storm of store bankruptcies and closures.Still, nothing at the 2-1/2 hour presentation could distract Wall Street from the company's gross-margin forecast.Shares finished 8% lower on Tuesday after CFO Karen Hoguet during the presentation warned that gross margins for the year were on track to be 60 to 80 basis points lower than last year. Among the factors she cited were excess inventory following the holidays and heavy promotions in the beauty business. She said she expected inventory levels to even out by the fall season.Macy's fell 0.4% to 21.81 on the stock market Wednesday, sinking intraday to their lowest level since September 2010.Macy's initially rebounded Thursday morning after Nordstrom (JWN) announced that it is mulling a ""going private"" move, but Macy's closed down 0.2%. Nordstrom shares skyrocketed 10.3%, though that was well off their intraday highs.J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS), which tumbled Tuesday on Macy's warning, reversed lower Thursday to end down 4.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Sears (SHLD) closed off 1.7%.Still, management on Tuesday said that beauty and home products were doing well within its off-price ""Backstage"" concept. Within apparel, where Amazon has become a big threat, Macy's is trying to rid its inventory of duplicate items and bring more exclusive items and faster fashion to store racks.CEO Jeff Gennette also emphasized the changes in the way people shop – the way physical stores and websites can play off one another when a consumer weighs what they want to buy – and Macy's opportunities in that evolution.""There's a place for both Amazon and Macy's to succeed with our customer,"" he said.Management said that it was ""open to all options"" in developing its e-commerce, and said that Wal-Mart's approach to its online business – including buying outlets like Jet.com – was ""quite interesting.""Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, in a research note Wednesday, said Macy's had done a ""good job articulating its challenges"" and that if its turnaround succeeded, ""America's love for shopping will be reengaged."" But he said an epic battle with Amazon would continue.""We think customers are 'familiar' with Macy's but don't really 'love' it,"" he wrote.Wal-Mart edged higher Thursday after rising slightly Wednesday following a retreat Tuesday. Amazon on Tuesday offered discounted Prime subscriptions to people on government aid, going after key Wal-Mart customers.RELATED:This Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail MeltdownSears Stock Tanks As CEO Accuses Suppliers Of Exploiting It

111,ULTA,"X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite showed tiny losses in afternoon trading Wednesday, but investors played more defense as money flowed into bonds and gold.Gold for August delivery rose to $1,295 an ounce, prompting a 1% gain for SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). The popular exchange-traded fund was recently trading around 123.09. It's trying to clear a base with a 123.17 buy point.The 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 2.14%.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was a laggard in the Dow, down 1.5%, after Amazon.com (AMZN) announced a discounted Prime membership for low-income shoppers.The news wasn't good for department store operators, which have been trending lower for months now due to deteriorating fundamentals. IBD's department store industry group was the day's worst performer, down more than 5%. Seven out of the top-10 worst performing groups Tuesday came from the retail sector.Shares of Macy's (M) slumped 7% after the company warned that gross margins would be worse than what was forecast in February.In the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) hit another new high, rising nearly 3% to 357.06, after Pacific Crest outlined a bull argument for the stock with a 439 price target, up from 371.Elsewhere, RV maker Thor Industries (THO) gapped up and rose 11% after reporting strong earnings before the open. Adjusted profit of $2.11 a share rose 40% from a year ago. Sales jumped  57% to just over $2 billion.On the downside, HD Supply (HDS) crashed 17% on an earnings miss. The company also agreed to sell its Waterworks business, which distributes pipes, hydrants, storm drains and other water-related products, to a private equity firm for $2.5 billion cash.Inside the IBD 50, Dave & Buster's (PLAY) looked poised for its fourth gain in five sessions ahead of its earnings report after the close. Shares gained nearly 3% to 69.98. After a breakout over a 58.35 buy point, the restaurant chain recently completed a four-weeks-tight pattern with a 67.93 add-on entry.Results from HSA administrator HealthEquity (HQY) are due after the close. It's in a good technical setup ahead of the results, just below a 49.35 buy point. Just after midday, a monthly call option with a 50 strike price (June 16 expiration) came with a premium of $1.40, or 2.9% of the underlying stock price ($1.40/48.35). One contract for the right to buy 100 shares of HealthEquity came at a cost of $140, excluding commissions. If HealthEquity heads lower on earnings, the most that could be lost on the trade would be the amount paid for the contract: $140.RELATED:Gold Gaps Higher; Is This The Right Time To Buy?Amazon's New Wal-Mart Assault: Prime Cut For Government-Aid RecipientsTesla Seen Rising 26% In Model 3 'Bull Case'; Puma, Microchip, Ulta Price Targets Hiked

112,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares broke out of a flat base Wednesday as cosmetics conglomerate Estee Lauder (EL), which owns a number of brands sold at Ulta, posted a view-topping quarter.Ulta shares rallied 0.6% to 290.36 on the stock market today, topping a 289.37 entry point, after climbing 1.9% on Tuesday. Ulta hit an all-time high of 291.50 intraday. Minus a slight dip below its 50-day moving average last month, the stock has been on a steady upward climb above that key level since November.Specialty beauty retailers such as Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora are having a moment as they enjoy popularity with younger shoppers flocking to the latest makeup trends.For Q3, Estee Lauder's adjusted diluted profit grew 24.7% to 91 cents, crushing consensus views for 73 cents compiled by Zacks Investment Research, while net sales grew 8% to $2.86 billion, above Zacks views for $2.81 billion.Estee Lauder shares gapped up 4.4% to 91.30, hitting their highest level since August, and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) edged up 0.5% to 26.79.While Estee Lauder is often associated with its traditional flagship brand sold at department stores, the conglomerate has been working on building its audience, rolling out the Estee Edit at Sephora last year. The parent of MAC Cosmetics and Clinique has in recent months announced the acquisitions of Too Faced and Becca, hot brands with the millennial and Gen Z set.Plus, MAC is hitting Ulta Beauty's online shelves at the end of the week (and physical stores in June), a move that has been well received by the beauty enthusiast community.""Bottom line, while some investors may be concerned that half of the strong sales growth in the quarter was driven by recent acquisitions, results nonetheless highlight the momentum in EL's business,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog in a note early Wednesday. She has an outperform rating on Estee Lauder.But Stifel's Mark Astrachan, who has a buy rating on the makeup giant, has a watchful eye on softness in the Americas, organic sales growth that was ""far below"" peers L'Oreal and LVMH, plus declining gross margin.On Monday, Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy said that while risk remains for Estee Lauder, given its department store exposure, ""the narrative of EL should improve, particularly with its ULTA initiatives (fastest growing; No. 2 destination).""

114,ULTA,"Last week, we learned from Piper Jaffray that teens love Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Nike (NKE) and Disney (DIS) movies.This week, a Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs report reveals the fashion, retail and beauty brands that their slightly older millennial peers love. L Brands' (LB) Victoria's Secret, LVMH-owned Sephora and Nike make the top three in favorability rankings, said Bloomberg, which acquired the results.And unsurprisingly, what millennials like and what Wall Street likes doesn't always overlap. Despite the recent softness in handbag trends, all three major purse makers made the list.Rounding out the top 10 favorites list were Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors (KORS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), DSW (DSW) and Nordstrom (JWN).Still, it's perhaps worrying for brick-and-mortar-based retailers that their greatest online nemesis is also climbing the ranks.IBD'S TAKE: The Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs study is but another reflection of the ongoing existential crisis faced by retailers — but the situation has created potential shorting opportunities for investors.Amazon (AMZN) topped the list as men's favorite retailer across all categories, said Bloomberg, citing the report, which also bestowed Amazon with the title of ""Most-Loved Brand"" overall.The recent Piper Jaffray teen survey showed similar results: Amazon gained ground as the No. 1 preferred shopping website among teens, reaching 43% share, said analysts.""(Amazon) Prime adoption has increased across all income brackets in each of the past six surveys,"" said Piper Jaffray analysts in last week's note.L Brands rose 1.5% on the stock market today. Nike fell 0.45%. Kate Spade lost 0.6%. Michael Kors dipped 0.1% while Coach fell 0.3%.Ulta Beauty fell 1.2% to 279.46, still above a 274.09 buy point but dipping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting that support level for the first time this year.Amazon slipped 0.5% to 899.20, just in range from an 860.96 four-weeks-tight entry.

115,ULTA,"X The stock market moved lower but recovered from intraday lows ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later today. The Fed's decision, which will be announced around 2 p.m. ET, is expected to leave rates unchanged.The Nasdaq dropped 0.5%, spurred lower by weakness throughout large-cap tech stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average only fell 0.1%, buoyed by energy components, while the S&P 500 moved 0.3% lower. Volume rose on both major exchanges. Among the other Dow industrials, Apple (AAPL) set the tone for the day after missing Q2 revenue and iPhone sales targets late Tuesday. The iPhone maker fell 1% after being down as much as 2.2% in early trading. Walt Disney (DIS) and DuPont (DD) fell 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively. Shares of Disney pierced the 50-day moving average on heavy volume, which would be a sell signal if the weakness persisted throughout the day.On the upside, energy components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) moved up 0.8% apiece, while McDonald's (MCD) rose 0.9% after Goldman Sachs (GS) upgraded the burger chain from neutral to buy, based on growing confidence in improving same-store sales.Large-cap technology and fiber optic stocks underperformed in the stock market today. Amazon.com (AMZN) declined about 1%, while China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) dropped about 2%. Fiber-optic names Oclaro (OCLR) and Inphi (IPHI) both issued cautious commentary regarding slowing Chinese demand, causing shares to plummet 7.6% and 16%, respectively.Earnings due out after the close include electric automaker Tesla (TSLA), payment provider Square (SQ) and social media company Facebook (FB). Tesla dropped 1.3%, but remains about 10% above a 287.49 cup-base entry, while Square declined over 3% to fall below a 18.27 flat-base buy point.

The firm maintained its outperform rating amid its raised expectations for the company's digital and delivery efforts.In early trading, the blue chip's laggards include financial component Goldman Sachs (GS) and energy components Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). The global investment bank fell 1.9%, while the oil giants fell 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively, as oil prices slipped more than 1%, leaving West Texas Intermediate just above $49 a barrel.On the S&P 500, computer security firm Symantec (SYMC) rose 2% after being upgraded to overweight from equal-weight at Barclay's. Shares were attempting to reclaim their 50-day line after piercing it on May 17.On the downside, energy names found themselves at the bottom of the S&P 500's performers amid a 1.4% decline in the price of crude oil.

119,ULTA,"Amazon.com (AMZN) isn't attending the annual ICR Conference in Orlando, Fla., but its presence was arguably felt in one way or another Tuesday morning.With holiday retail figures out — some tremendously disappointing to investors, others less so — and Amazon crowned the clear winner of Christmas by Slice Intelligence, the conference presents an opportunity to reflect on a modern shopping landscape pockmarked by growing online sales and subdued mall traffic.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) management said it was ""relatively happy"" with its real estate portfolio, calling it ""pretty healthy"" and noting that it doesn't feel particularly hurt by Macy's (M) recent announcement to close dozens of locations, despite having stores in those same areas.But an outperforming digital channel could prompt store closures anyway.""We're looking at things like digital penetration to brick-and-mortar sales within that region,"" said one executive at the conference. ""You know, if a store's in a C-mall location, for instance, and although we're still making money (but) we're seeing digital having a much higher penetration — you know, we might decide to close that store. ""He then said that the company ""will definitely see a decrease in our U.S.-based real estate portfolio over the ongoing years, particularly as traffic gets more challenged in some of the C(-mall) locations.""American Eagle shares were up 1.7% at 15.22 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.15%.Separately, Lululemon (LULU) CEO Laurent Potdevin told CNBC following his presentation that the upscale yogawear maker is being targeted in its approach.""When you think about traffic, we're not going after every bit of traffic; we're really focused on getting highly qualified traffic,"" said Potdevin on CNBC. ""If you'd been in our stores during the holiday season, they were really, really busy. And our conversion was outstanding, both in-store and online.""What about Amazon moving in on the apparel space with activewear of its own?""When you have more competitors, you have a bigger market, and it's an opportunity,"" said Potdevin in response. ""I'd rather have more competitors than no competitors. . . It really validates the strength of the market.""Lululemon shares rallied 3% to 70.26 as they work on a cup-with-handle base with a 72.80 buy point.And then there's beauty, which has thus far been a market that's shown relative immunity to Amazon's appetite for brick-and-mortar retailers' business.For e.l.f. beauty (ELF) — which began as an e-commerce business — part of that advantage comes in the form of speed-to-market. It takes the low-cost makeup company as little as 20 weeks to bring a product to market, while larger, slower-moving players can take up to two years to launch product, according to e.l.f. executives at the conference.""We've been able to grow regardless of economic cycle,"" said e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin.E.l.f. is carried in retailers like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS). With only a handful of stand-alone stores, it is expanding its reach via in-store partnerships with existing retail heavyweights.""We see Ulta (ULTA) and Walgreens (WBA) as natural partners and expect a possible announcement in the next 60-90 days,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink following the presentation.""The company's trend identification, development speed, and commitment to newness are both averaging up the gross margin and driving working capital utility, but are also setting the brand apart at retail from a merchandising, messaging, and engagement perspective.""Shares of e.l.f. were down 1.6% at 28.60, near the low of a flat base with a 32.64 entry.
"
120,ULTA,"Stocks showed mildly lower, rangebound action on Friday. Small caps continued to rebound.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, defied the overall mild weakness seen in the Nasdaq as it traded virtually flat following a solid rise over the prior eight sessions that sent shares back bullishly above the 50-day moving average.Top growth stocks almost always trade above the 50-day line before staging a breakout.At one point, Apple shares got as high as 116.50, and the stock is still on course for a strong weekly gain.Now the largest company in the U.S. markets lies just points below a potential new entry at 118.79.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% while the Nasdaq 100, covering the 100 largest nonfinancial companies, was off 0.4%. Both indexes, however, stand a good chance of finishing higher for a second straight week.The Dow Jones industrials were off roughly 0.1%, the S&P 500 sank nearly 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.2%.Volume is running sharply higher on both exchanges vs. the same time on Thursday as monthly and weekly options expire today.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA) applied the brakes and eased 0.8% to 97.96 after touching the 100 price level for the first time. While the stock has made a superior run since finding support at or near the 50-day moving average three times since September, the stock has not triggered many sell signals.At 98.57, the chip designer for video game consoles, computers and machine-based learning initiatives trades 74% above its rising 200-day moving average. While that's a high level, it's not extreme.A study of top performing names researched by IBD during the 1994-1997 period found that among 95 leading small- and midcap stocks, the average maximum close above the 200-day line was 111%; among 25 top big-cap names, the average maximum close was 57%.As annotated on the IBD Leaderboard chart of Nvidia, the stock briefly pierced an upward channel line, signaling the importance for chart readers to watch the stock closely for topping signals. Among key signals to spot: new highs in low volume, the biggest one-day point drop in heavy volume, large negative reversals off a new high in big volume, and a sharp pierce of the 50-day moving average.Back to Apple, as explained in prior editions of IBD's Stock Market Today, Apple has moved as slowly and steadily as one would expect from a mature large-cap former leader. Plus, Apple has transformed into a growth and income stock, given that holders can reap an annualized dividend yield of 2%.However, Apple still continues to show growth stripes. The Sept. 14 breakout past a 110.33 buy point ushered a decent rally of 7.5% before the stock succumbed to market choppiness. However, the stock did not trigger any key IBD sell rules and found buying support at the key 200-day moving average.Other large-cap techs showed tests of support.Priceline Group (PCLN) fell 1.3% to 1480.87, shaving some of the day's sharp losses, after naming a new CEO. Former longtime CEO Jeffery Boyd will return to the post of executive chairman.Since October, the leading online travel and restaurant reservations service has successfully weathered three prior sell-offs that took the stock back to or below its 50-day moving average.Like Apple, Priceline is clearly another large-cap tech that shows the type of solid single- to double-digit top and bottom line growth seen in many members of IBD's Big Cap 20. Priceline, which sports a $72.8 billion market value, is expected to grow its earnings per share 11% to $64.63 this year and 18% to $76.24 the next.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Priceline sports a poor RS Rating but that's due to its tendency to create long bases in recent years. The SMR Rating is a top-notch A.Among other growth names, top-performing specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) stormed to as high as 266.57 before cooling off to a 1.8% gain at 26.140. The cosmetics, skin and hair care specialist has formed a double bottom base since August, but a Dec. 2 breakout past a 268.88 entry failed the same day.Ulta's Accumulation/Distribution Rating could use some improvement, currently at a C- according to IBD Stock Checkup.The stock has had a magnificent run since clearing a bottoming base pattern in late August 2009, rising 2,200% from the 12.10 entry. So keep an eye out for more instances of heavy institutional selling, which would indicate that some fund managers are taking advantage of the recent run-up to unload positions. RELATED:When Did Apple Initially Break Out?IBD's Click Blog: Why Apple's Fundamentals Look Bright In 2017

121,ULTA,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

123,ULTA,"The main indexes were mildly higher at midday Wednesday as three FANG stocks saw unusually heavy trading, while the retail sector took another blow.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were up 0.1%. Dow component Visa (V) made a new high in active trading. The small-cap Russell 2000 fared a bit better, up 0.3%.The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2%. Three of its major components — Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — were up 0.3% to 0.9% in volume well above normal levels. Turnover in Facebook was tracking three times more than its average, while Alphabet and Amazon saw smaller spikes in trading. That suggests institutional investors are moving money into their favorites.Price movements in the three were modest, yet significant. Amazon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, hit new highs. Facebook continued to make progress from a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Volume was running lower compared with the same time Tuesday.Brick and mortar retail, which is having an awful year, saw several stocks drop in heavy volume after a series of disappointing results.Tiffany (TIF) gapped down 7% in intense trading after the jewelry chain's same-store sales for the April-ended quarter dropped surprisingly and revenue missed expectations. The plunge ruined a flat base the stock had been forming.Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) gapped down nearly 5% after the company's quarterly sales and profit came in below estimates. Lowe's (LOWE) gapped down more than 4% and sank further below the 50-day moving average, triggering a sell signal for the stock. The home improvement chain missed expectations for its April-ended quarter and gave a weak outlook.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) slid 2% in volume tracking at nearly five times its average. Shares are now below the 50-day moving average and below the 289.37 buy point — a disquieting sign just a day before the company announces quarterly earnings. Ulta has been one of the most sturdy retail stocks, in large part because its format is resistant to online competitors. A sell-off in its shares would further weaken a retail sector that is short on winners.

128,ULTA,"Imagine you buy a quality stock and it never gets much past the 5% buy zone. Day after day, the stock dances either near or within the buy zone.At the same time, the stock doesn't trigger a sell rule, such as the 7% to 8% loss-cutting stop.How much time should you give the stock? And which is the more likely next step — an advance toward a double-digit percentage gain, or a descent to the 7% loss?So far this year, 20 quality stocks have cleared buy points in strong volume only to stall in or near the 5% buy zone. What happened next?The results can be sorted into four tiers of varying success and failure.First tier: Four of the 20 stocks eventually went on to rise 15% or more from the ideal buy point.Driver-assistance software maker Mobileye (MBLY) spent about four weeks loitering in the buy zone after a February breakout past a 45.03 buy point. Even an earnings report that came in 10% above expectations didn't help Mobileye much. Finally, the stock gapped up in mid-March on news that Intel (INTC) would buy Mobileye. The stock rose 37% from the original entry.Ad tech firm Criteo (CRTO) spent almost seven weeks in the buy zone after a breakout past a 44.24 entry on Jan. 11. The breakout came in low volume, but heavy volume kicked in about 12 days after the initial clearing of the entry. (The stock price remained little changed during the 12 sessions, keeping a potential buy alive.)Criteo fell about 3% on Feb. 22 despite trouncing the consensus on earnings. The next day it popped 5% and cleared the buy zone. The stock's gain eventually reached about 21%.Mortgage insurance provider Essent Group (ESNT) cleared a 34.04 flat-base buy point on Jan. 25. The stock seesawed above and below the buy zone. The gain eventually reached 16%.After clearing a 53.03 entry in a lopsided base, midcap stock Paycom Software (PAYC) bobbed within and just above the buy zone for five weeks, then rose to a gain of 15%.Second tier: Six stocks ended the post-breakout sideways action with moderate gains of 10% to 13%.The six are Priceline.com (PCLN), CommScope (COMM), Alibaba (BABA), Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY), Qorvo (QRVO) and Tarena International (TEDU).So the totals for stuck stocks that resolved the inaction with positive outcomes is 10 of 20.Third tier: Three stocks neither rose much above the 5% buy zone nor triggered a sell rule: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR). Their stories are still being sketched.Fourth tier: The bottom tier is comprised of seven stocks — initially stuck in the buy zone — that eventually triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule. However, five of the seven showed gains of 7% to 9% before starting the slide to the sell rule. A disciplined investor could've sold the stocks for a small gain before they cycled into a loss.Overall, the sideways action after the breakout has been worth enduring. Either the outcome was positive or savvy portfolio management could have helped the individual investor dodge the worst outcomes.RELATED:To Find Big Winners Seek The A In CAN SLIMLearn To Recognize Flaws In The ChartHow To Invest: Still The Golden Rule Of Selling

129,ULTA,"Here's a pair of markets not sensitive to interest rates: hair salons and cosmetics counters. Hair gets styled and skin foundations applied no matter how interest rates might crash or soar. And that has helped salon-and-cosmetics chain Ulta Beauty (ULTA) fashion formidable growth even as retail trades in general undergo harsh structural change. Ulta's shares consolidated from August to February, eventually…

130,ULTA,"The major indexes made piecemeal moves in afternoon trading Wednesday, but techs continued to lead the way higher with just three more trading sessions left in March.Cisco Systems (CSCO) is taking a breather, falling nearly 0.7% to 33.76 in light volume and hampering efforts of the Dow Jones industrial average to rally. The 30-member Dow is down roughly 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite and the tech-rich Nasdaq 100 are both up about 0.3%. The S&P 500 inched slightly higher and is just above 2360.Cisco shares, however, are still up more than 5% past a recent flat-base entry at 31.99. It's been featured frequently in IBD's Income Investor column, which highlights companies that have excellent earnings stability, a minimum 2% annualized yield, and decent relative strength.Cisco, the greatest stock market winner of the 1990s as it literally built the plumbing of the world wide web, no longer has the same growth characteristics as it did when it initially cleared a double-bottom base as a small-cap growth leader right after the stock market bottomed in October 1990. Now, with a $169 billion market cap and a 3.4% annualized dividend yield, the Silicon Valley stalwart in data networking routers, switches and other communications gear has been busy battling new upstarts including Arista Networks (ANET), currently ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50.Arista, embroiled in a technology patent court battle with Cisco, is down nearly 0.7% to 133.00, but volume is quiet and the stock's uptrend is firmly intact since its breakout past a 75.50 cup-shaped pattern in the week ended Aug. 12, 2016.That cup helped put the finishing touches on a long bottoming base pattern, seen among many current stock market leaders today. Arista went public in June 2014 at 43 and quickly ramped up to 94.84, then went into a deep freeze for nearly two years before finally building that first-stage cup pattern and eventually breaking out to 52-week highs.Arista has grown earnings per share 54%, 47%, 51%, 36%, 37%, 41% and 30% vs. year-ago levels over the past seven quarters. That amazing track record of profit growth is one reason why the Santa Clara, Calif., firm holds a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Revenue rose 33% to 42% over that same time frame. Wall Street sees FY 2017 earnings growth slowing, up 14% to $3.77 a share.As noted in a recent Big Picture column, while policy at the federal government level can certainly spur entrepreneurship and risk-taking, it's the innovative companies themselves that are the true engines of economic growth and job creation. Look for those companies that have outstanding products and services, rock-solid management, and stocks that have the ability to power to new highs and rise above their 10-week moving averages.All of these factors go into IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investment paradigm, noted by AAII as the top investment strategy for stocks across multiple time periods going back to the late 1990s.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which has redefined the way people shop for cosmetics, hair and skin care products and services, has made a terrific move since clearing a three-month cup at 188.58 back on March 11, 2016.Ulta today gained 0.57 to 283.43 and is currently in the proper buy zone, up 3% past a 274.09 entry in a double-bottom-with-handle base. Shares broke out of the slightly warped-looking pattern in early February in light volume. Both the advance and volume picked up steam on March 10, a day after Ulta reported a 33% jump in fiscal Q4 earnings per share and a 25% rise in revenue to $1.58 billion.That matched the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 16 quarters.The top-performing specialty retailer is expected to see strong double-digit EPS growth during the next two fiscal years (up 24% in FY 2018 to $8.07 a share, up 21% in FY 2019). In tech land, NetEase (NTES) also deserves continued watch. The Chinese giant in online video games is basing after rising past a 257.78 cup-with-narrow-handle entry. Watch for potential support at the 10-week line.Symantec (SYMC) is staging a stunning turnaround, not just in stock price but also in profits. The stock, up more than 1% to 30.84, has shot 19% past a 25.82 flat-base entry.Wall Street sees earnings rising 14% to $1.19 a share in FY 2017, which ends this month, then galloping 47% higher to $1.75 a share in FY 2018. Industry peer Fortinet (FTNT) rose 4% to 38.08 in above-average turnover.The stock joined IBD's new SwingTrader premium service as one with potential to make a strong move over a period of several days to potentially a few weeks.Finally, digital marketing and imaging software leader Adobe Systems (ADBE) continues to thrive, edging up for a sixth straight session to 129.21. The San Jose, Calif., firm cleared a 107.90 entry in a shallow double-bottom base with handle in early January and has climbed as much as 19%.Adobe gets a solid 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99. Wall Street sees profit rising 31% to $3.95 a share in FY 2017, ending in November, and another 26% to $4.99 a share in FY 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today I: Can Snap Finish A First-Stage Base?Stock Market Today II: 5 Solid Big Cap Names For 2017How To Invest: The Elements Of A Bottoming Base PatternHow To Invest: How To Find An Outstanding Cup-With-Handle Base

131,ULTA,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

137,ULTA,"XStocks tiptoed to modest gains in lighter trade on Thursday amid investors' multiple concerns that range from talks between President Trump and China's Xi Jinping, news that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to deleverage its monster balance sheet of debt, and the ongoing nuclear threat from North Korea.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up about 15 points, less than 0.1%, to 20,662. The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising nearly 0.3%. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%.Small caps outperformed by a mile. The Russell 2000 gained 0.9%, helped in part by a rebound among smaller banks after the Federal Reserve signaled that it's getting more committed to a tighter monetary policy and lightening the debt load on its balance sheet later this year.These future monetary actions are likely to keep interest rates on an upward path, which could boost profit margins for many lenders.

None of the 30 components in the Dow industrials are up more than 1 point, but building sector play Home DepotHD padded its recent gains, rising 0.5% to 147.59.

The Nasdaq 100, comprising 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the all-electronic stock exchange, got a 0.1% boost, in part courtesy of Apple (AAPL), which is also a component of the Dow Jones industrial average. Shares in the largest company by market cap (now at $731 billion) rose 0.1% to 139.32, holding near its all-time peak of 140.28.Currently, Apple has risen 20.3% since Jan. 1, a stellar start in 2017 after a rebuilding year in 2016.

Aggressive investors or long-term holders could have bought when the stock move past the 63.75 high within this tight trading pattern.Shares are now 5% past a 63.85 buy point. Looking at a daily chart, the recent tight trading is long enough to meet the five-week (or 25 days) time requirement for a flat base. What makes Advanced Energy's flat base unusual, however, is the fact that both the high and the low of the pattern is in the same session of trading, on Jan. 31.Advanced Energy is a small-cap name in IBD's semiconductor equipment industry group, and that group is currently No. 1 in the latest IBD Weekly.The company is enjoying a fine turnaround profits-wise. Earnings dropped 50% in the fourth quarter of 2015, then another 14% in Q1 of 2016.

143,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) delivered another Street-topping quarter late Thursday, one that marked a second consecutive period of accelerating profit and sales growth. The specialty beauty retailer's same-store sales growth of 16.6% is practically unheard of in this lukewarm retail environment.Yet Ulta Beauty tumbled in after-hours trading Thursday and fell at Friday's open to test its 50-day moving average before soon reversing higher. Shares finished 4.6% higher at 286.42 trade after setting an all-time high of 285.92 in the stock market today. Ulta is back in buy range from a 274.09 buy point, but this is the first time it's crossing that entry area in heavy volume.So what gives? Was that overnight selling a sign that investors are getting nervous about this retail outperformer's stamina?Guidance was soft, for one. For 2017, Ulta said it expects ""low twenties percentage range"" profit growth, below current analyst expectations for 26% gains in per-share earnings. First-quarter outlook of $1.75-$1.80 EPS on $1.244 billion-$1.265 billion also came in light vs. views for $1.80 a share and $1.273 billion in revenue.But longtime followers of Ulta know that management has historically provided conservative guidance.""ULTA has beaten its sales guidance in all but one quarter since 1Q10 as one of the best guiders we cover,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel. ""We expect this to prove conservative yet again.""Another cause for concern late Thursday? A miss on gross margin estimates. Ulta's gross profit fell by 10 basis points from the prior year quarter, short of forecasts for a 40 basis point gain, ""as management called out tough compares against reduced promos (last year) and ongoing fixed cost investments,"" according to Wells Fargo's Ike Boruchow.He added that while Ulta's quarter was ""clearly a standout in retail today,"" the gross margin miss was ""a little surprising,"" since it was the first quarter in two years that the company's gross margin did not expand. Boruchow maintained a market perform rating on the stock and raised full-year earnings estimates.But analysts don't seem particularly worried by the gross margin miss. Piper Jaffray's Stephanie Wissink, who rates Ulta overweight, said this was ""less of a concern given the favorable dollar contribution of lower margin rate prestige brands.""Additionally, Wissink pointed to Ulta's 63.4% e-commerce growth, which points to improved logistics and fulfillment, in her view, boosted by distribution-center investments, inventory management and quick order-turnaround times.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com is a formidable foe for retailers, but it lacks a satisfying in-store experience and other ""It"" factors that cosmetics shoppers want. Lackluster foot traffic and e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) have weighed heavily on department stores like Macy's (M) and specialty apparel retailers.But Ulta's online sales now account for 9.8% of total sales, as of Q4, even as retail same-store sales rose 12.8%, bucking a retail earnings season littered with strong online numbers but weak or declining in-store comps.Management expects total comparable sales to rise 9%-11% in the current quarter and 8%-10% for the year.That has many looking sunnily on the stock.""Although we fully understand setups & sentiment, a (high single-digit to low double-digit) traffic-driven comp guide from a perpetually conservative management seems like a win in this environment of brick & mortar pain,"" wrote Instinet's Siegel, who has a buy rating on Ulta.Separately, value cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) closed down 2.5%, ending above its 50-day line after undercutting that support level earlier. On Thursday, e.l.f. shot up 12.3% on strong earnings and guidance, though the stock closed well off its session high.RELATED:Ulta Beauty Earnings, Sales Strong, But Guidance Isn't Pretty

144,ULTA,"U.S. stock indexes tacked on minor gains midday Friday, as volume appeared poised to fall on the Nasdaq for the first time all week.The Nasdaq added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 echoed the gain. The small cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.4% gain and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume in the stock market today fell sharply across the board.Winners and losers were mixed, with the postelection uptrend looking tired. In the IBD 50, banks and financials were mostly down. Technology stocks, which were hammered Thursday, had some rebounds but others scored some additional losses. Among stocks attracting heavy volume, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped about 1%.After Thursday's close, the company delivered a three-sided beat. Results topped views on earnings, revenue and guidance.One possible reason for the stock-price drop might have nothing to do with Ulta or its earnings. The Retail-Specialty group is a laggard, rating No. 148 among 197 industry groups. For a stock to advance, a tailwind from its group is a critical component. Lone-wolf winners exist but are rare.Blue chips were mostly up, but the gains were generally small. The day's biggest pop on the Dow belonged to United Technologies (UTX), up 1% in slow trade. The Dow's biggest loser was Goldman Sachs (GS), down 1.7% in heavy volume.Goldman was in for some profit-taking. The big-cap financial booked weekly gains of 16%, 3%, 0.5% and was headed for a 5% weekly gain Friday. The stock is extended and nowhere near a valid buy point.West Texas intermediate crude oil was quiet for a change, holding above $52 a barrel.RELATED:Is More Growth Ahead For Ollie's Bargain Outlet?The Case For A Donald Trump Era Secular Bull Market
"
145,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) beat-and-raise quarter and whopping 16.7% same-store sales growth make the specialty shop something of a unicorn in the rather uncertain world of retail. What's driving growth? Good investments by management plus a broad consumer enthusiasm for beauty products, say the experts.""ULTA's multi-year investment spend is clearly generating positive results (improved ecommerce, targeted marketing, product mix, in-store experience, new planning/forecasting systems) as the concept continues to attract new customers to the box,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow, who rates the stock market perform.Ulta shares shot up to 273.90 soon after the opening bell, clearing a 268.88 buy point briefly. But the stock reversed to trade down as low as 244.75, finding support at the 50-day line. Ulta closed down 1.6% at 253.39 in the stock market today. It wasn't clear why Ulta reversed lower.Something similar happened after its Q2 earnings report, when Ulta delivered strong results but shares tumbled 6% the following day and continued to slide for the next few weeks. But with that report, Q3 guidance was a little cautious. That was not the case with Ulta's Thursday report, which included a solid Q4 outlook.Q3 comps were driven by both transaction (11.1%) and average ticket growth (5.6%). Retail comps rose 14.3%, including 10.3% salon comps.The in-house salons and makeup services ""keep Ulta 'un-Amazon-able,' "" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who believes that its service offering ""continues to become more compelling,"" particularly with the addition of online booking. He has an outperform rating on Ulta.While Amazon.com (AMZN) threatens to devour other retailers whole, Ulta's e-commerce sales rose 59.1% during the quarter.IBD's TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from eating into Sephora and Ulta's market share? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Beauty has been pegged, for now, as an Amazon-proof market. The experiential nature of cosmetics and skin care products means that shoppers like to see and try items in person, bringing foot traffic into brick-and-mortar locations. (Plus, the in-store experience is designed to be engaging — look at the product-tester playground that is Sephora.)Ulta's rewards program grew 28% to 21.7 million active members, year over year, bolstering its strong base of loyal shoppers.It's unclear as to when Amazon and other e-tailers might begin to encroach on Ulta and Sephora's precious beauty space. And high valuation concerns dog Ulta's stock.Perish the thought, says Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel.""We think investors should ignore the hang up and buy the best retailer in the business, or wait for market pullbacks & do it then,"" he wrote, ""as ULTA is proving repeatedly that it sits at the top of the retail pack, in our view.""And as the beauty train chugs along, value beauty brand e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) could also stand to benefit. Cowen says ""the momentum and significant addressable market size ULTA sees for this consumer bodes well for long-term sustainable growth for ELF.""E.l.f. shares fell 1.7% to 29.65 after rising as high as 30.69 and dropping as low as 29.05. The stock is in buy range again from a 29.02 buy point first cleared on Nov. 14. E.l.f., which came public at 17 in late September, plunged 4.2% on Thursday, moving back into the entry zone. Plunging back into a buy zone in heavy volume should raise some concerns.Amazon shares fell 0.45% to 740.34, their fifth straight decline.RELATED:Ulta Shines Late; Ambarella, Workday Reverse Down; Five Below Jumps

Just like on Tuesday, the indexes weakened into the close and ended near session lows.Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) weighed on the industrials after the New York Times reported that the heavy-equipment maker was accused of tax fraud.Volume was higher in the major exchanges, according to early numbers.Retail, a sector that's been battered, led the market. Just like it was unclear why the sector sold off Monday, there were no obvious reasons to explain Wednesday's rally.Apparel retailers did get a boost after Children's Place (PLCE) soared past the 11.30 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. The chain beat profit expectations and raised its dividend.Biotechs also were up broadly. The group climbed 1.5%, among the day's top five.Homebuilders continued their emergence in the market leadership. Century Communities (CCS), Lennar (LEN), Pulte Group (PHM) and a few other builders continued to rise from their latest breakouts.But the energy sector tumbled after U.S. oil futures slid 5.4% to $50.28 a barrel. U.S. oil production climbed last week to the highest level since February 2016, and crude inventories rose for the ninth straight week.Utilities were in the bottom as well. IBD's four utility industry groups finished in the bottom 20 of 197 groups.An early burst in financials came apart quickly. The SPDR Financial (XLF) ETF erased most of a 1.4% increase to close with a minimal gain.On Thursday, earnings are due out from Finisar (FNSR), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Embraer (ERJ).

147,ULTA,"Amazon (AMZN), Tesla Motors (TSLA), GrubHub (GRUB), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) could all soon provide actionable trading opportunities, with catalysts ranging from earnings to pending tax cuts under Trump.Amazon is still within the 5% buy range from an 821.75 handle entry cleared last Tuesday, and it's also just under an alternate entry at 847.31, which would put it at a new all-time high. The e-commerce giant reports quarterly earnings late Thursday.Tesla has rallied nearly 40% since the beginning of December and is now 6.1% away from a potential buy point at 269.44. Investors see the made-in-America electric automaker as a beneficiary of the Trump administration's pending corporate tax cuts.GrubHub has been in consolidation mode since last September, and is now trading 6.3% below a 44.68 buy point. Shares have made considerable gains over the past few weeks as analysts say the online food delivery service, too, is set to be a big beneficiary of tax cuts.IBD'S TAKE: With an IBD Composite Rating of 98 and considerable share-price gains as of late, GrubHub earns a spot on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. For details on why GrubHub is such a fundamentally strong stock, check out our latest New America article.Domino's is just pennies away from a cup-with-handle buy point of 172.10. The stock, which closed Friday at 172.02, has made considerable gains over the past year amid accelerating bottom-line growth.Ulta is 1% below a 274.09 entry in a base-on-base pattern. Shares saw a wild negative reversal in the last earnings report on Dec. 2, but the stock has steadily risen since.

148,ULTA,"A yawning trench of dirt, wood and exposed cables currently sits at the mouth of the Westfield Century City in west Los Angeles. The Apple (AAPL) store is still open and the Tesla (TSLA) showroom has been moved to a different spot, but much of the shopping center remains under construction.When it reopens this year, it will have expanded into a glamorous 1.2-million-square-foot beast of a mall — 422,000 square feet larger — complete with Italian food emporium Eataly, hip burger joint Shake Shack (SHAK) and ""new high-fashion streetside boutiques.""XIn fact, the Century City mall won't just be a mall, it will be ""an immersive sensory experience unprecedented in the modern retail space,"" according to a 2015 Westfield press release. This location hardly needs a tuneup. With $1,457 in sales per square foot, it is the ninth-most productive mall in the country, according to a CNBC story from May, citing real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. So why spend $800 million on a makeover?Looks matter more than ever, particularly as social-media bragging rights become an essential part of the millennial shopping experience. So these days, every retailer has to put on a good show, ramping up the drama to boost foot traffic and cheat death as Amazon (AMZN) spells doom for more and more American malls.""(Young people are) very into cataloging everything they do via social media, and so these more luxury experiences have more social currency,"" said Talmage Advisors CEO Liz Dunn.That could mean Snapchatting from inside a Tiffany (TIF) — regardless of whether you buy something — or taking a topside photo of your artisanal lunch. (Never has flat lay photography been so popular.)""Whatever it is, there's a lot more social currency to that than saying 'I'm at a TGI Friday's,' "" she said.The mall's transformation into an ""immersive sensory experience"" contrasts with the post-World War II bloom of malls, which attracted Americans to cookie-cutter hubs with their one-stop-shopping convenience. That has since given way to the splendid isolationism of two-day shipping via Amazon Prime, hollowing out traditional malls and forcing the survivors to become purveyors of experiences that can be shared online.Fellow L.A.-based shopping center The Grove, owned by Caruso, underscores the trend and is a social-media maven's dream.It houses many of the same stores as a regional mall does — like Banana Republic, J. Crew and Anthropologie — but also features a fountain, trolley and live music, helping put it at No. 2 on CNBC/Green Street Advisors' list with a $2,200 in sales per square foot. The photogenic plaza was even once the backdrop for Hollywood-gossip show ""Extra,"" which has no doubt upped its social cred among tourists who want a glimpse of glam.""This is where all the B-list celebs, YouTube stars, and Instagram influencers shop (I saw an Instagram male model there myself when I went),"" gushed one Yelp reviewer visiting from Toronto.The lure of exclusivity, that close cousin of luxury, is another way retailers have amped up the theatrics.It's a tactic long employed by an athletic-footwear industry that routinely releases shoes in small batches, driving up demand from sneakerheads and high-schoolers alike. There's even a sneaker stock exchange, StockX, devoted to the resale of Jordans, Kobes and anything Kanye has ever designed for Adidas.Other retailers have since caught on. Coach (COH) and Disney (DIS) last year introduced a limited-edition House of Mouse-themed handbag line. Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria Beckham is behind Target's (TGT) upcoming capsule collection. And H&M seems to have an endless series of designer linkups in the pipeline.The New York Times even declared 2016 ""the year of the drop,"" referring to the slew of limited-edition releases and pop-up shops, like Kylie Jenner's blink-and-it's-gone store, designed to create shopper frenzy.The Hollywood Reporter called the December opening of Jenner's pop-up, located within the Westfield Topanga Mall in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, ""mayhem.""Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent. A Kylie Lip Kit, however, is not long for this world.To get a teen or 20-something to the mall — and most ""drop"" shoppers are under 30, noted the Times — the mall must act a little more like a nightclub, velvet ropes and all.Even supermarkets are in on the action: Some Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR) and Gelson's locations feature wine bars, a premium add-on meant to keep grocery shoppers in stores longer.Such theater may seem gimmicky, but it works, and is also being seen in actual theaters. The local cineplex, a requisite component of any shopping mall, is also undergoing a revamp.On the defensive from Netflix (NFLX) and massive TVs, theaters have been making screens bigger, audio better, and seats more spacious. And as an alternative to grabbing popcorn from the concession stand and trying to find a decent seat, more theaters now serve cocktails and dinner to your reserved Barcalounger while that summer blockbuster plays in Imax 3D.AMC (AMC), for example, embarked three years ago on a $600 million reseating project to rip out traditional chairs and replace them with recliners.AMC, which has called its collective upgrades a ""winning playbook,"" outlined at a recent presentation that attendance has grown 53% and revenue leapt 70% in its 1,500 or so reseated theaters. It has thousands more theaters in line to be updated.Top exhibitor chain Regal Cinemas (RGC) also recently attributed recent outperformance to plush seating, calling out recliner sites as the ""biggest driver.""""Theaters have to do something to differentiate themselves from the in-home experience,"" said RBC analyst Leo Kulp. ""That's really what's driven these investments over the past several years.""Theaters, full-service restaurants and other bells and whistles have woven themselves into a successful mall's narrative, but it may be a while before the experiential stuff surpasses retail stores that sell shirts and shoes.""The future will certainly bring less retail, but it will take a few years to tip the scale"" so that retailers become a mall's minority residents, said NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen.There is also some hope for once-reliable mall anchors like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), even as Macy's reportedly considers selling itself after a brutal holiday season.The Grove has a Nordstrom, and the revamped Westfield Century City is actually adding a department store to the mix, for a total of three major names. It will now house a two-story Macy's, three-story Bloomingdale's and a three-story Nordstrom that is being relocated from the next mall over.But the massive upgrades being made to shopping arenas could even further widen the gap between top-market malls and their less-moneyed brethren.Of the more-than-1,000 malls in America, the 300 or so top-market ""A-malls"" account for 75% of mall value (a metric comprised of sales productivity, size and other factors), according to Green Street Advisors.So what's a midtier mall to do? For developers, the answer may be: Change or die.Strong anchors are ""imperative"" for a shopping center's long-term viability, according to Green Street's 2017 mall outlook report, since income-generating tenants want malls with ""vibrant,"" traffic-driving anchors.As department stores waver, Green Street's research points to restaurants, movie theaters and ""traditional power-center tenants"" — like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and pet stores — as rising power players.But Talmage Advisors' Dunn is not optimistic.""The problem is, it's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy,"" she said. ""The landlords aren't willing to invest in the lower-tier centers, and the thing that would potentially take a lower-tier center to help it jump a bracket is investment. But it's hard to justify the investment if the center's performance isn't in that top-tier range.""

151,ULTA,"March dawned with new highs for the major stock indexes. The last time U.S. stocks posted a negative month was before the November election. Thus far, the Trump effect retains its grip on the ETF market.That same old glow, a jaded investor might say, but that is no excuse for investment decisions to get stuck in a rut. While sector-equity ""Trump Trades"" are still the rage, some successful investors are on the prowl for a different approach to playing this remarkable stock rally with exchange traded funds.Eric Biegeleisen, director of quantitative research at Beaumont Capital Management, looks through the prism of factors for his best ETF investment ideas as market conditions evolve.A factor approach to investing aims to harvest the drivers of return in a group of stocks — such as the momentum and size factors, or attributes, that Biegeleisen currently favors.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017His list of potential winners all focus on U.S. stocks and are backed by the same provider, but have little else in common. Each produces a markedly distinct basket of stocks as a result of its targeted factor.""These exposures should perform well if the growth that is anticipated remains intact throughout the year,"" Biegeleisen said. Beaumont has $3.57 billion in total client assets and offers several ETF-based portfolio strategies including a popular tactical sector rotation strategy.Biegeleisen serves as portfolio manager of the firm's factor-based and smart-beta strategies. Here are the investing pro's own words:Following the unexpected results of the election in November, we have seen U.S. equities race higher along with dollar strength, initially at the expense of severe declines in U.S. Treasuries and emerging markets. Since then, U.S. Treasuries have remained down and are now trending sideways, while emerging markets came back strongly and are now positive.Through the lens of a BCM factor (smart beta) strategy, we have seen very low levels of volatility, leading the strategy to remain fully invested overall but with emphasis on momentum, yield and size. These exposures should perform well if the growth that is anticipated remains intact throughout the year.These ETFs are currently owned by Beaumont Capital Management or could be purchased at any time:Year to date through the end of February, momentum has been the best performer of the major equity factors followed by yield. Size has actually been the worst performer (yet still positive), which may be due to the strong performance it achieved immediately following the election last November.Nonetheless, the new administration seems intent on delivering on all campaign promises. We believe those firms who exhibit strong positive momentum should continue to perform well as the market continues higher.In addition, firms that deliver return to shareholders through dividends should also see a continued boost as investors remain invested generally, but also are searching for yield as interest rates remain subdued.Finally, the smaller, more U.S.-focused companies should have renewed investor interest if U.S.-centric trade policies, i.e., a border adjusted tax (BAT), are enacted.RELATED:Growth ETF Strategy Taps Rally That Trump Has Ignited In 7 S&P SectorsWhat Going On In The Stock Market Now?

Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 2.8% from a year ago, just a tad behind the fastest growth of the recovery. The Federal Reserve had already telegraphed a near-certain rate hike on March 15 before Friday's report confirmed the second straight month of stellar job gains. Job gains were lifted by warm weather, which fueled a 58,000 rise in construction employment. Yet enthusiasm about the Trump agenda of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending has clearly been a factor behind the spurt in job growth and economic confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, though dipping slightly to 55.3 in March, remained close to February's 12-year high.The key question is whether the optimism — and strong job growth — is sustained throughout the spring, in which case the Fed's rate-hiking timetable will accelerate.RELATED:House Republicans rolled out legislation to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare, with the legislation clearing some hurdles despite opposition from various liberals, conservatives and moderates.

162,ULTA,"A lukewarm shopping environment hasn't put a blemish on the beauty industry, which has been the fastest-growing retail segment for the last three years, according to NPD Group.Specialty players Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH-owned Sephora are flourishing — and value cosmetics brand and recent issue e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) appears poised to take advantage of the on-fire trend.E.l.f., which sells its wares mostly via CVS (CVS), Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty and other national retailers, went public at 17 in late September, rising roughly 70% to about 29 a share as of Wednesday.In an email Q&A with Investor's Business Daily, e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin outlined his approach to engagement, the significance of its small but growing brick-and-mortar presence, and the company's greatest growth opportunities in 2017.IBD: Social media — Instagram in particular — has become a hot spot for beauty enthusiasts. Following e.l.f.'s Beauty Scape activation, how does social media play into your engagement strategy in 2017, and how do you see that impacting the new loyalty program?Amin: Our approach to engage consumers is deeply rooted in social media and digital platforms, and will continue to be a main pillar of our engagement strategy. We were extremely pleased with the outcome of our e.l.f. Beauty Scape activation, which delivered a 25% increase in Instagram followers and reached a combined community of 53 million across social media platforms. We believe we can further build awareness and deepen engagement with our consumers in different ways, including our new Beauty Squad loyalty program. We enrolled 80,000 consumers in just the first six weeks and look forward to continuing to expand the program as we strengthen our CRM capabilities and deliver more fun, relevant content for our consumers.IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""IBD: You've previously said that the majority of growth will be driven by your presence in retailers such as Target and CVS? How do you see the sales mix of e.l.f. direct-channel, third-party e-commerce (such as Amazon) and national retailers shifting over the next few years, if at all?Amin: We expect the U.S. to be the largest source of our growth over the next few years as we grow space allocation with existing retailers, increase new customers and grow our direct-to-consumer business through elfcosmetics.com and e.l.f. stores. The majority of our growth will be driven by national retailers, given the white space that we see here in existing doors as well as new doors. That being said, our direct channel plays an incredibly important role in terms of validating our innovation and engaging with our consumers, and we believe there is significant room to grow here as well.IBD: There are fewer than 20 stand-alone e.l.f. brick-and-mortar retail locations. What's the significance of building out a brick-and-mortar presence?Amin: In Q3 of 2016, we opened seven e.l.f. stores, to bring our total to 15, including our first California stores, with two locations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Our stores showcase a broad assortment of e.l.f. products, create an environment dedicated to play beautifully, and allow us to test and validate new products. We believe our stores provide a great opportunity for us to connect with our consumers in an experiential format, and drive both awareness and engagement.IBD: Cosmetic and skin care products are still selling well, even as other areas of retail have struggled. Do you see interest in beauty peaking any time soon?Amin: We believe that the cosmetics category is highly attractive given its scale, growth dynamics and consumer demand trends. And, given the importance of cosmetics in a woman's daily regimen and the availability of products across price points, the category has demonstrated resiliency through economic cycles. We expect cosmetics to continue to be among the fastest growing and most consistent consumer categories.IBD: What's the biggest area of growth and opportunity for e.l.f. in 2017?Amin: We believe we are in the early innings of growth as we continue to make progress on our four key strategies: Build a great brand, lead innovation, expand brand penetration and drive world-class operations. We continue to see momentum in both our direct channels and leading national retailers, as well as strong operational results and remain excited about our business as we head into 2017.RELATED:How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

163,ULTA,"The stock market enjoyed a mild yet broad rally on Friday following stellar U.S. job gains and a decent rise in hourly wages for February.The Nasdaq composite's 0.3% gain exceeded advances of 0.2% for both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. But the Nasdaq is still on track to snap a six-week winning streak.Some sector indexes fared better. The Dow Jones transport average rose 0.7%. The S&P SmallCap 600 kept pace with the large-cap gauges, up 0.3%.In the stock market today, a handful of high-quality specialty retailers showed that investors are still seeking excellent companies that can capitalize on consumer spending.Restaurant-cum-arcade chain Dave & Buster's (PLAY) gained 1.6% to 59.51, gaining further ground past a 58.35 flat base entry. The flat base, which can show a decline of no more than 10% to 15% from the base's intraday high to low, began with the down week that ended on Jan. 6 this year.Dave & Buster's, which still qualifies as a small-cap stock with a $2.5 billion market cap, has the highest Composite Rating within IBD's restaurants industry group at 94 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD's proprietary time-saving research tool, Stock Checkup.Wall Street sees the Dallas-based firm posting double-digit EPS growth in both fiscal 2017 (up 36% to a record $2.06 a share) as well as in fiscal 2018 (up 16% to $2.38). Top-line growth is expected to be lighter yet still robust (up 16% in FY 2017 ended in January, up 15% in FY 2018).Industry peer Domino's Pizza (DPZ) continues to be a long-term market leader, rising more than 1% to 186.74.Notice on a daily chart how the global consumer spending play has held above its rising 50-day moving average in recent months following a light correction in December.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reversed in glamorous form, erasing early losses to rise 4% to 285.12, good for a new high. Shares are still in buy range, up 4% past a 274.09 early buy point within a choppy, unusual-looking base that began with a sharp decline in the week ended Aug. 26 last year.The cosmetics, hair and skin care retailer notched mildly accelerating EPS growth for a second quarter in a row as Q4 profit grew 33%, up from gains of 24% and 26% in the prior two quarters.Ulta's revenue jumped 25% to $1.58 billion, extending a string of 20%-plus year-over-year increases to six quarters. After-tax margin improved to 8.9% vs. 8.5% in the year-ago quarter.Ulta's Composite Rating of 89 is not great yet still decent, and it's tops in the small Retail-Specialty industry group. Keep in mind that many retail stocks these days tend to have lower Composite ratings due in part to poor industry group relative strength. Apple (AAPL) rose 0.3% to 139.14, reaffirming its dominance among blue chip techs in 2017.The megacap iPhone maker is now up 26% past a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point that IBD noted in a Stock Market Today column on Sept. 14 last year. That cup with handle is part of a long bottoming base that began with Apple's peak of 134.54 on April 28, 2015. In Apple's bottoming base, shares fell as much as 33% to a low of 89.47 in May 2016 before finally rebounding.Apple has also acted well since forming another cup with handle and breaking out of that base on Jan. 6 at 118.12.In that 11-week cup with handle, the decline was extremely mild at just 12.3% from head to toe. This is actually a good thing, however, when you consider that most solid cup-with-handle patterns tend to show a decline of 20% to 30%.Plus, Apple's handle, which formed over six sessions in late December, showed a very light drop in bone-dry trade (please see a daily chart to spot the handle forming. That's ideal action for the final shakeout of uncommitted holders before a potential new breakout and big rally to 52-week or all-time highs arrives.In the small-cap kingdom, thinly traded MYR Group (MYRG) broke out with a big gap up, rising more than 12% to 42.41 and surpassing a 41.52 flat-base entry.The specialist in transmission, distribution and maintenance services for utilities reported a 66% lift in adjusted fourth-quarter profit, roasting Wall Street views by 20%. Revenue jumped 27% to $343.7 million, the biggest year-over-year jump since the second quarter of 2012.MYR trades just 63,000 shares a day, but institutional sponsorship is clearly rising. Mutual and hedge funds owning a stake increased from 276 at the end of 2015 to 332 at the end of 2016.A mediocre 66 Composite Rating belies MYR's solid 85 RS Rating. Plus, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is spiking into new high ground.RELATED:How To Invest: Why The Bottoming Base Matters For Growth Stock Pickers, Even In 2017Investor's Corner: How To Analyze The Handle's Quality In A Good Base PatternInside The IBD 50: Will These 15 Bank And Finance Stocks Make Big Strides In 2017?News On Apple: Go To IBD's Technology Section And Click Blog

But can it keep up this pace?When the specialty beauty retailer reports late Thursday, Wall Street expects 26% profit growth to $2.13 a share on 21.5% revenue gains to $1.54 billion.Shares fell 2.1% to 269.92 in the stock market today, moving back below a 274.09 buy point and testing its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. The stock has been rising just above or below the entry area for the past several weeks.Other retailers — including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Target (TGT) — have disappointed investors. Amazon.com (AMZN) looms ever larger as the reason for many retail woes.But the off-price, home improvement and specialty beauty sectors frequently get call-outs for eluding Amazon's tentacles.And one indicator of Ulta's holiday-quarter performance may come from rival Sephora, whose parent company LVMH reported results in late January.""We're optimistic on the opportunity for sustained growth at ULTA, as LVMH reported further (double-digit) growth in revenue and profit at Sephora, driven by market share gains in all regions,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in late January, adding that strong shopper demand for specialty beauty products ""bodes well for Ulta.""In fact, he appears to prefer it over Sephora, which only carries high-end ""prestige"" brands. Ulta carries mass brands such as Revlon (REV), Maybelline and NYX in addition to upscale products from the likes of Urban Decay Cosmetics and Nars.""While we acknowledge ULTA and Sephora overlap on some brands, we continue to like ULTA's exposure to a wider demographic with a broad spectrum of brands from mass to prestige.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding back Amazon and other e-commerce pure plays from eating into Sephora and Ulta's market share? There are several reasons why Amazon has been powerless against beauty stores. But even strong reports don't always provide Ulta shares with an immediate post-earnings boost. Its last two quarterly disclosures have been accompanied by declines before shares picked up steam again.E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) reports Q4 results Wednesday after the closing bell.

170,ULTA,"High expectations got the better of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) last quarter, despite solid results and bumped-up guidance. Could that happen to the specialty beauty retailer again, even if its third-quarter results shine late Thursday?As of Monday, Wall Street analysts are anticipating per-share profit to rise 23% to $1.37 a share on 22% revenue growth to $1.11 billion.Cosmetics and skin care are retail standouts. Specialty shops Ulta and LVMH-owned Sephora have been riding the beauty trends, with Ulta able to serve up double-digit same-store sales growth during a time when many other retailers are hoping for comps that are simply in the black. And analysts often call out Ulta Beauty as a top retail pick, immune to the charms of shopping on Amazon (AMZN).So why would investors expect anything but a rally from positive results? A quick recap:Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 results in late August, shares tumbled over 6% and sank below their 50-day line. Slightly light Q3 profit guidance and concerns of high valuation were tossed around as possible causes.One equity strategist even mused on Twitter that male investors might not ""get"" the beauty business.Since then, however, Ulta has raised its Q3 and full-year guidance. For the 2016 fiscal year, it now expects mid-20% EPS growth and 12%-14% comps gains, up from low- to mid-20% growth and 11%-13% increases, respectively.Shares popped back up above their key 50-day level on the news.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta isn't the only retailer taking advantage of shopper lust for beauty products. Department stores and mall names are trying to build on a social media-driven interest in makeup to lure in foot traffic: ""How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of Retail.""Flash forward to the present: Ulta fell 0.8% to 261.60 in the stock market today, after hitting 265.38 earlier. Shares are closing in on a 268.88 buy point in a double-bottom base. Ulta had climbed in 13 of the prior 14 sessions as of Friday.The current holiday quarter is looking good so far.Beauty department traffic was solid on Thanksgiving eve and Black Friday, according to one analyst.""Traffic overall in beauty was solid; we expect ongoing strength in the category to persist through the December quarter,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink on Friday.And shoppers are currently in the thick of Cyber Monday sales, so the numbers have yet to roll in, but the National Retail Federation expects a slight uptick to 122 million Americans who intend to plunk down dollars online today.E.l.f.

Shares were able to find support at the 200-day line on Nov. 7 and have risen in 13 of the last 14 sessions.

The stock closed Friday at 46.58, nearly 16% above the entry.

182,ULTA,"Paycom Software (PAYC) has a big opportunity selling human resources and payroll processing software to small- and medium-size business, says Jefferies, which hiked its price target to 69 from 58 on Monday.""Proven execution in its core SMB (small to mid-size business) market, direct sales force with strong product expertise, and regular releases of new modules, make it well positioned to capture this opportunity,"" said John DiFucci, a Jefferies analyst in a report.""The transition to SaaS is most appealing for SMBs, which historically haven't been able to spread the cost of required expertise across a large employee base,"" said DiFucci. ""We believe SMBs remain particularly ripe for SaaS adoption given they tend to use standardized solutions that don't require customization.""Paycom on Feb. 9 reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped views and forecast 2017 sales slightly above consensus estimates. They came amid uncertainty over whether the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress will repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.Shares in Paycom Software fell 2 cents to 56.45 in the stock market today.

""However, it has been difficult for any strategic activity to take place as the industry is in the midst of multiple investment cycles that have increased profitability and valuations.""She went on to say: ""Ultimately, this industry needs to have fewer players to be healthier when current cycles end. Capital raising by many market participants in the past few months certainly raises the probability of an event, something we hope to hear more chatter about next week.""According to a Jefferies analyst, Finisar could be eyeing Oclaro or other companies.Stocks in IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group have seesawed in early 2017 amid a bumpy earnings season and weaker-than expected demand from China. But they closed the week strong, extending post-Fed gains on Friday. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) rose 5.9%, Acacia Communications 5.35%, Lumentum 1.1%, Oclaro 4.1%, Finisar 2% and Ciena 0.85%. Infinera dipped 0.6% after rising more than 8% on Thursday.Applied OptoElectronics and Lumentum have the highest IBD Composite Rating, an investing metric, in the group, with both at 99. Oclaro comes next with a composite rating of 95 out of a possible 99.Shares in Lumentum have climbed on speculation it could push into a new market, consumer electronics, and lasso a big customer in Apple (AAPL). Lumentum is developing 3D sensors for smartphones. Finisar is also targeting the 3D sensor market.IBD'S TAKE: Paycom Software and Ulta Beauty are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Demand from China has been driving revenue growth for makers of fiber-optic components and network infrastructure, as is the upgrade to 100-gigabit-per-second technology by telecom firms such as Verizon Communications (VZ) in the U.S. New demand also is coming from interconnecting cloud-computing data centers packed with computer servers.""While China will definitely be an area of conversation at OFC, we wouldn't expect component vendors to have any clearer view on 2017 demand than they did at earnings until they hear what has come out of the National People's Congress (currently in progress) early in April,"" added Marshall.RELATED:Finisar Flubs Q3 Earnings; Revenue, Outlook Miss, Stock PlungesFiber-Optic Gear Giant Ciena Dives On Earnings, Sales MissAmazon, Facebook 'Server-Side Optics' Good For Lumentum, Finisar

191,ULTA,"The major indexes hit a little turbulence on Friday, but that doesn't mean compelling chart action is lacking. Your stocks to watch this week are Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX), Tesla (TSLA), Mobileye (MBLY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).Apple is extended about 16% from its cup-with-handle buy point of 118.12, with gains fueled by a strong quarterly report on Feb. 1. When a stock gains 20% past an entry, that's usually a good place to take at least partial profits. And when the market uptrend is under pressure, it can be sensible to sell part of your position at a 15% increase to protect your gains.Starbucks dropped hard after its last earnings report, which included its slowest profit growth in at least five years, but the stock is now looking to form a base. Shares have been able to retake the 50-day moving average and are nearing a shallow double-bottom entry at 59.10. But keep in mind that Starbucks has a weak Relative Strength Rating of 28 out of 99.Tesla sold off in the wake of its quarterly results late Wednesday. That has caused the stock to go on a ""round trip"" after breaking out past an entry at 258.56, which can be deemed as a sell signal. But shares were able to find support at the 250 price level on Friday.Mobileye was hit with bearish comments from short-seller Citron research on Friday. The loss put the stock back in the upper bound of the 5% buy range after clearing a 45.03 handle buy point in strong volume on Feb. 13, but it's still holding up relatively well. When Citron targeted Mobileye back in September 2015, the stock lost 10% for that week.Ulta Beauty has sneaked into buy range past a 274.09 buy point from a flat base, inching up in low volume over the past few weeks. Though the stock is trading near all-time highs, you want to see heavy volume when a stock enters a buy zone — that indicates institutional support.

209,ULTA,"Costco Wholesale (COST) missed fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales forecasts and increased its annual membership fees, which are a major contributor to the retailer's operating income.Estimates: Profit for the February-ended quarter up 10% to $1.36 a share on 6% revenue growth to $29.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Results: EPS of $1.17 on revenue of $29.13 billion. Same-store sales rose 3% in Q2. U.S. comps in February, excluding gasoline, rose 2%, below the 3% gain predicted by Retail Metrics.Effective June 1, annual fees for individual and business memberships in U.S. and Canada will go up by $5. Fees for Executive memberships will go up by $10. Costco sees the changes affecting 35 million members, with about half of them Executive members.Membership fees contributed $2.65 billion to Costco's fiscal 2016 revenue, which totaled $118.7 billion for the year. Those fees accounted for the bulk of Costco's operating income.Stock: Costco sank 4.5% late. Shares closed up less than 0.1% at 177.98 in the stock market today. Costco stock is well out of buy range after clearing a 165.05 entry point from a cup-with-handle base.Why It Matters: For the same reason that TJX (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) matter — they're all retailers that aren't floundering.Last month, Costco reported 5% in comparable-sales gains for January, excluding currency impacts and gas-price changes, marking the biggest comp-sales gain in over two years. This comes at a time when big-box retailers like Target (TGT) are struggling amid a war with Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Plus, some on Wall Street are speculating that Costco is mulling another increase to its membership fees. UBS analysts believe a fee hike is ""still likely"" in 2017, citing Costco's history of raising fees every five or six years.RELATED:Burlington Stores Stock Hits New High On Strong Earnings, OutlookCostco Soars On Biggest Comparable Sales Gain In Over 2 Years

212,ULTA,"U.S. stock indexes were down modestly Monday, but small caps took a harder hit.The small-cap S&P 600 stumbled 0.9%, which if it holds would be the sharpest loss in about four weeks. Small caps have been leading the current market uptrend. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 trimmed 0.3%, respectively. Volume was sharply higher vs. Friday's half-session pace.The Dow Jones utility average spurted 1.5% higher, while the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index dropped 1.1%. The day's action could be pointing to an adjustment after the Trump rally.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, utilities held most of the day's top spots. On the downside, retail, cement and steel — mostly Trump-tied plays — pulled back the most.Blue chips were mostly down. In the Dow, losers led winners by an 8-3 ratio. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) suffered the biggest loss, down 1.5%. Verizon Communications (VZ) had the biggest gain, up 0.5%. Verizon has mediocre stock ratings, but offers an annualized dividend yield of 4.6%.In the IBD 50, a list of some of the strongest stocks in fundamentals and technicals, small-cap Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) leapt 6% in huge volume.  The biotech group has been riding high since early November.Sucampo is expected to show 29% earnings growth when final numbers for 2016 roll in.

213,ULTA,"U.S. stock indexes tacked on small gains Tuesday, as the market lingered near recent all-time highs.The Nasdaq crept 0.3% higher, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% as it crossed the 19,000 level. Volume in the stock market today was about 10% higher on the NYSE and about 7% higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.While the indexes haven't been rising in long strides, a number of stocks have been making aggressive moves up or down.In the S&P 500, apparel and accessories retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN) was one of the day's best performers only to undo it after hours. The stock sprinted almost 5% higher in twice its average volume in the regular session. Then the stock dropped about 9% after hours. Urban Outfitters reported quarterly results after the close. The Street's consensus estimate on earnings called for a 5% gain to 44 cents a share. Revenue was pegged at 5% to $869.07 million. The figures came in at 40 cents and $862 million, a double miss, according to preliminary data.On the chart, Urban Outfitters cleared a 37.32 buy point in a shallow double-bottom base a little more than a week ago. The double-bottom base is a pattern that is shaped like a W. The middle peak plus 10 cents becomes the buy point. Urban's 5% buy zone runs to 39.19, which was nearly reached in Tuesday's regular session.A stock should not be bought more than 5% beyond the ideal buy point.Urban Outfitters is recovering from a deep sell-off in 2015, but Tuesday's quarterly results are a setback. The stock's IBD Composite Rating is a respectable 82. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 82 puts the stock in the top 18 percentile.In the IBD 50, a proxy for highly rated stocks, fast-food chain Jack In The Box (JACK) rose 6% in heavy volume. Jack fell 3% in after-hours trade Monday on quarterly results and weak guidance, but the bulls won Tuesday's battle. Jack retreated 4% in the first five minutes of trade and then reversed higher en route to its 6% gain. The low of the day nearly took Jack to its 50-day line, where it found support and then broke out. As Jack's case illustrates, after-hours trade is not always a reliable guide for a stock's action in the next regular session.Also, in the IBD 50, metal products maker Worthington Industries (WOR) surged 5%, but volume was only average. Meanwhile, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) advanced 3% in volume 30% above average.Blue chips were mostly up. Verizon Communications (VZ) and Home Depot (HD) held the day's biggest gains, 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Verizon is lowly rated, but Home Depot's 94 EPS Rating is the highest in the Dow. A rating of 94 means the stock is growing earnings faster than all but 6% of the stocks in IBD's database.RELATED:Existing Home Sales Strongest Since 2007Marvell Technology: What Is The Chart Really Saying?

214,ULTA,"Consumers hit the malls, PCs and phones over the holiday weekend for big discounts, but they spent less than a year earlier, the National Retail Federation said Sunday, with more people shopping online than in actual stores.Average spending per person fell 3% to $289.19 vs. 2015, according to a Friday-Saturday NRF survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics.""It was a strong weekend for retailers, but an even better weekend for consumers, who took advantage of some really incredible deals,"" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. ""In fact, over one third of shoppers said 100% of their purchases were on sale.""The number of shoppers rose to 154 million from 151 million in 2015. That reflected a 4.2% rise in online shopping and a 3.7% drop in-store shopping.Analytics firm RetailNext found that in-store sales tumbled 10.4% on Black Friday.The NRF survey found that 44% shopped online and 40% went in-store.Thanksgiving and Black Friday online sales rose 18% to $5.27 billion, according to a separate survey by Adobe Digital Insights, higher than the $5.05 billion expected.Apple (AAPL) products, notably discounted Apple iPads and some Macbooks, were among the big Black Friday sellers online, Adobe said. While Apple did take part in Black Friday directly this year, Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT) were generally seen as having better online deals.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for stocks that are at or near proper buy points? Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Ulta Beauty are stocks to watch.The continuing shift to online should be good news for Amazon, which has dominated e-commerce growth in recent years. Amazon said Thursday-Friday sales would top a year earlier, but that's not really a surprise. Eight of the 10 retailers that had the fastest e-commerce growth were brick-and-mortar locations.Target was bullish about Thursday-Friday sales generally.With deals more widely available throughout November and December, Thanksgiving weekend may be less important. That could explain why the average consumer said they reduced spending this year.Just 9% of consumers have finished holiday shopping, down from 11% a year ago, NRF said. And 23% have yet to do any gift buying, up from 19%.""With mid-season shopping behind us, it's not too late for retailers to tweak their online and in-store strategies to help increase traffic and see a big payoff during the last few weeks of the holiday season,"" Shay said.Next up is Cyber Monday. But with online deals so omnipresent already, how much buzz can retailers generate for this traditional online shopping day? Wal-Mart (WMT) launched its ""Cyber Monday"" deals at the crack of midnight on Friday.

Analysts see 25% growth.In addition to guiding 2017-2019 EPS growth above 20%, Ulta sees comparable sales growth of 7%-9% for that period, up from prior guidance of 5%-7%.Ulta jumped 11.4% to 266.14 on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day line for the first time since giving earnings guidance in late August that was a little light.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta stock plunged in August on its Q3 guidance, but a bullish indicator on the company's shares could have been seen on insider purchases following the market dive.

"
221,ULTA,"Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Super Saturday. The annual retail running of the bulls is a treacherous terrain of sharpened elbows and trigger-happy mouse clicks for shoppers trying to get the best deal possible.The stakes are even higher for the stores themselves: The National Retail Federation has said that sales in November and December can account for anywhere from 20%-40% of a retailer's yearly sales. Perhaps fortunately for department stores like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others, there's nowhere to go but up this Christmas.""Given the fact that last year was so horrible, the comps are easy,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.As weather, inventory issues, heavy discounting and e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) weighed, Macy's reported a 4.7% same-store sales decline in November and December of last year. Kohl's Q4 2015 comps edged up a mere 0.4%. Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle. Athletic wear also continues to dominate street fashion.Nike (NKE), TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) remain Siegel's long-term choices.Holiday shoppers, unconcerned about the fate of retail stores, will continue to like what they like.Millennials, who favor experiences over tangible goods, may not be retailers' favorite customers. But PwC research found that the teen set, Generation Z, likes ""stuff — and shopping in stores.""""To them, stuff matters,"" said the report. ""Stuff like personal electronics, clothes, shoes, and toys. Which is what they're hoping to receive this holiday season.""RELATED:Black Friday Is The New Cyber Monday: Wal-Mart Pushes Up Sale

222,ULTA,"Most major stock-index ETFs opened lower Wednesday as the Trump rally faded and concerns about U.S. oil stockpiles mounted. But the retail sector made a modest advance amid a slew of mixed earnings reports.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) dipped 0.2% on the stock market today in early trading.This exchange traded fund, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is flirting with its August high of 219.60, having advanced almost 2.0% since the Nov. 8 election.Consumer sectors topped advancing S&P 500 sectors with a 0.3% gain. The financial sector, which has led the postelection rally, trailed as banks pulled back from a run that took them to their best level since 2008.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) popped 0.5% higher in morning trade. Among retailers, Target (TGT) gapped up nearly 9.0% on its earnings beat and holiday guidance.Major department store chains like Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's (M) also have reported strong results or given upbeat guidance in recent trading sessions.IBD'S Take: The retail ETF has had a lackluster showing in the past year. While Amazon has left Macy's and Kohl's struggling to maintain and expand their customer base, Ulta Beauty hasn't been as easily disrupted by online shopping and free shipping.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) traded around the flat line Wednesday, a day after making a stand at the 115 level for the third time since April. The yellow metal has come under pressure postelection as investors flocked to risk assets and the U.S. dollar rallied.The gold ETF's trend remains under pressure following the breach of the 200-day moving average last week, Ari Wald, a senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer, told IBD on Tuesday.In the current market, he favors risk trades and is looking for GLD to stabilize.Here's a look at the performance of major exchange traded funds across key asset classes on the stock market today.The Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months vs. all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.2%, RS 56PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.5%, RS 56SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.2%, RS 58IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.1%, RS 65IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +0.3%, RS 73IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.9%, RS 34Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.6%, RS 48SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.3%, RS 34United States Oil (USO), +0.4%, RS 25IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), 0%, RS 31PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.3%, RS 51IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +1.2%, RS 1
"
223,ULTA,"More than 9 million posts on Facebook's (FB) Instagram get the hashtag #selfiesunday, 6 million-plus are marked #selfienation, about 275 million are tagged #selfie, and 302 million are simply tagged #me.So is it any surprise that products like Make Up For Ever's ""Ultra HD"" foundation, Temptu's airbrush foundation kits, or Pur Cosmetics' ""Love Your Selfie"" palette exist?""Millennials have a mindset of being 'selfie-ready,'"" Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. That has helped drive lip and eye products to become two of the best-performing cosmetic categories for the last three years, she says, highlighting that the beauty sector's growth tracks ""almost exactly"" with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices.Camera-friendly cosmetics — once the realm of news anchors and movie stars — are now mainstays at specialty beauty stores Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora. But as Amazon (AMZN) continues to suck up more dollars from consumers, brick-and-mortar chains are increasingly latching on to the social media-driven fire for cosmetics and skin care products, which are proving to be a glimmer of hope for a surprising range of shops trying to lure Instagram-savvy shoppers.Last year, cosmetics, skin care and fragrance made up a $37.7 billion market in the U.S. vs. $266.8 billion in apparel and footwear sales, according to Euromonitor research. But beauty has been the fastest-growing retail segment for at least the last three years, outpacing apparel, footwear, food, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing segments online, said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.Echoing that trend, Ulta continues to crank out double-digit same-store sales gains — 14.4% in its most recent quarter — while the Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) each posted comps of negative 2% in their latest reports, while Nordstrom (JWN) reported a 1.2% decline. Their respective stocks have followed the diverging sales trajectories as well.IBD'S TAKE: Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock.The major chains have taken notice, and are looking for a makeover with some social-media flair.Retail icon Macy's, which by Cowen & Co.'s estimates will be overtaken by Amazon next year as the biggest U.S. clothing seller, is planning to open more in-store locations of luxury beauty retailer Bluemercury, a 2015 acquisition, and is expanding its brand assortment beyond traditional prestige names to include smaller labels.And for any shoppers who bought $35 in Rampage accessories, the nation's largest department store also recently offered a free selfie stick.""Beauty is the new hoodie, in terms of being a product that works well with social media,"" said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, noting that retailers are looking for categories that are less vulnerable to promotions and unseasonable weather. ""You can't deny the power of social media. On average, someone will spend over 15 hours a week on social media.""Social media help shape and stimulate new trends, he added, as well as educate others about those trends. Makeup lovers now scour Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube for contouring tips and skim hashtags for brow-shaping tutorials from the seemingly endless parade of self-appointed beauty gurus with a domain name and an Instagram account.Department store beauty counters remain a fixture but are in particular danger of losing relevance in this digital age. NPD Group said that compared to two years ago, 11% more women are doing cosmetics product research online.By the time the customer enters the store, she's frequently past the product research stage, says Wissink. ""She walks in, she says 'I need palette 212,' and (the salesperson) goes 'Wait a second, don't you want to see our lip, our eye (products)?'""The social-media driven shift in habits means retail heavyweights have to enhance the store experience. In fact, chains that previously had no service aspect are adopting in-house experts to guide customers through the beauty aisle.For example, CVS Health (CVS) now has in-store beauty consultants and last year upgraded its makeup and skin care offerings in a few thousand locations. In its August earnings call, CEO Larry Merlo said the drugstore chain was focused on shifting its assortment toward health, beauty and store brands, all of which are higher-margin segments.And Target (TGT) features a ""beauty concierge,"" clad entirely in black and available to answer questions about the big-box retailer's brands.""It's meant to create retail theater,"" said Wissink, noting that customers ""crave that tactile in-store experience.""Shoppers enjoy sampling new products in store, and the quest for a Holy Grail blush can become a day out with the girls. In the process, it's not uncommon to snap a selfie and send it to a friend — or to Twitter (TWTR) followers — for immediate feedback.For their part, premium brands like Estee Lauder and Clinique are loosening their grip on exclusivity as they accept that shoppers like to sample different brands from a variety of retailers.They've broadened their distribution to specialty retailers like Ulta and lower-tier department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP), which nixed creating a whole new in-store beauty experience in lieu of bringing in an already-successful titan: Sephora.Its in-store Sephora locations were among the department store's top-performing divisions, the company said in its Q2 earnings release in August, and there are plans for more Sephora shop-in-shops to drive beauty-revenue growth.""Seems like everyone's trying to get a piece of that pie,"" said FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""It's working, at least for Sephora and Ulta, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon.""And as beauty products increasingly drive traffic to stores, chains that traditionally haven't sold them are now testing them out.A Barnes & Noble store seems like a peculiar place to open up a beauty counter, but it may be inclined to seize trends early, given that Amazon laid waste to book sellers.The Glossary, as it is cleverly called, is a college-focused shop-in-shop stocked full of makeup and skin care products from Smashbox, Burt's Bees and other millennial-friendly brands, not far from the Jane Austen paperbacks and math textbooks needed to survive freshman year. Barnes & Noble College — a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Education (BNED) -- has rolled out the pilot program at a handful of locations, including Emory University, Southern Methodist University and the University of California at Riverside.""(It's) similar to what they did a few years ago with coffee shops,"" said NPD's Grant. Barnes & Noble wants shoppers ""to browse, to know that they can hang out."" After all, the longer retailers can get customers to stay in the store, she said, the better the chances of them buying something.Apparel stores like Urban Outfitters (URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are also cultivating nascent beauty offerings. Teen retailers have broadly been trying to reconfigure their identities now that their millennial consumer base has grown up and out of midaughts trends.Urban's curated ""Back-to-School Beauty"" collection showcases a small mix of products, including trendy Korean brand Tonymoly and uberhip Milk Makeup. (Besides select Urban Outfitters, the only other place to buy Milk in a store is Sephora.) In its mid-August earnings call, Urban Outfitters management called out the strength of its beauty segment, as well as its home and intimates divisions.American Eagle's foray into the beauty space has been more hesitant, though it may have more up its sleeve. Its Aerie Global Brand President Jennifer Foyle noted in American Eagle's May earnings call that the company has assembled a team ""to venture into the beauty business, but we are going to walk before we run."" It, too, sells Tonymoly face masks, plus some assorted Aerie-branded lotions and body washes.Rolling out new display cases is one thing, but building up a healthy following on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is another.Out of all of its department store brethren, Nordstrom has the strongest social presence, with 2.1 million Instagram followers to Bloomingdales' paltry 608,000 and J.C. Penney's 300,000 follower count. It was one of the first major companies to incorporate Like2Buy into its Instagram profile, allowing customers to click through and buy the pictured products.All of them pale in comparison to Sephora's 8.8 million followers and Ulta Beauty's 2.4 million Instagram devotees. Still, the department stores are seeing progress at the cash register.Nordstrom's summer ""Glam-Out Days"" offered free makeup tips and services during its yearly ""anniversary sale"" event. According to Piper Jaffray research, beauty products had the highest sellout rate during the promotional period, with 51% of Nordstrom's makeup and skin care products selling out, up from 30% last year and 8% in 2014.""One of the things that makes beauty important within department stores is (that) it's a gateway,"" said Grant. ""It helps the retailer attract other consumers, whether it's apparel or footwear. One of the things they've used the beauty space to do is carve out new consumers or drive traffic through the rest of the store.""RELATED:Beauty's A Hot Industry, But Does That Make E.L.F.

"
230,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which ramped up third-quarter and full-year earnings guidance ahead of its investor-day presentation Thursday, may have outlined in one slide why Amazon (AMZN) hasn't yet been able to penetrate the beauty retail castle that specialty stores like Ulta and Sephora have built.Culling data from its own ""beauty enthusiasts,"" Ulta management told analysts Thursday that less than a tenth of its online sales come from online-only shoppers, meaning that most still manage to find a way into a brick-and-mortar Ulta store, even if they're able to order items online.And that online experience ""reflects interest in discovery, trial and newness."" In other words: B+eauty buyers like new things.The main worry behind Amazon's potential for being a beauty-business usurper is that it is an easy source of replenishment — that recurring makeup and skin-care needs can be fulfilled in the way that Amazon's dash buttons allow for a quick and convenient reorder of laundry detergent or cat litter.But beauty shoppers, by and large, love the in-store experience. Ulta's impressive double-digit same-store sales contrast with other retailers' negative comps in this often-lackluster retail landscape.""Newness drives the business,"" said Ulta management at the presentation.IBD'S TAKE: For a meatier look at Amazon's struggle to overpower specialty beauty retailers, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Ulta says the e-commerce environment is meant to complement the in-store experience, and indicated in an earlier slide that it sees its digital presence ""as an Ulta Beauty retail store traffic driver.""Plus, omnichannel customers, i.e. those that shop both online and in-store, tend to spend more — much more. Omnichannel shoppers spend an average of $474 annually at Ulta, vs. $177 from those who only visit the store and salon, and $112 from the online-only crowd, according to Ulta's presentation Thursday.Ulta Beauty shares jumped 11.4% to close at 266.14 in the stock market today, nearly recovering all the losses from an Aug. 26 plunge sparked by light earnings guidance.RELATED:Ulta Beauty Lifts Views, Sees EPS Growth Above 20% Through 2019Do Male Investors Not 'Get' Ulta Beauty And The Beauty Business?Ulta Beauty EPS Guidance Is Blemish On Priced-For-Perfection Stock

But not so much for Estee Lauder (EL).MAC remains the No. 1 preferred cosmetics brand among both upper- and average-income young women, but its decreasing market share among those groups prompted her to downgrade MAC parent Estee Lauder to neutral.Specialty beauty stores are still on top: LVMH-owned Sephora dominates as the most-preferred beauty destination for affluent young women (41%), followed by Ulta (20%). Among average-income female teens, they're neck and neck, with Ulta at 29% and Sephora at 27%. Both gained share among the latter group.Broadly, teens are dedicating more and more of their allowance to cosmetics and skincare. Among young women, beauty products now occupy 11% of ""wallet share"" -- i.e. the proportion of annual spending on each category, per Piper Jaffray's definition -- up from 8.5% five years ago and 7% a decade ago.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at Amazon's struggle to elbow out specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and Sephora, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Separately, Wissink raised her estimates on Ulta following its investor day conference on Thursday, as she sees the beauty retailer becoming ""a much larger business with the potential to double earnings.""Piper Jaffray rates the stock overweight with a 290 price goal.Ulta upped its Q3 and full-year guidance Thursday, prompting an 11.4% surge that largely erased the slide that occurred after the company's last quarterly report, which topped expectations but offered slightly light guidance.Shares of Ulta fell 1.3% in the stock market today.

He said a delayedsale of its high-end HiSeq X5 or X10 genome-sequencing system, likely to a China customer was one reason. These systems can cost $1 million-plus, so the sales cycles are long, often longer than expected. U.S. sales of the company's 2500/4000 line also drove the miss, says Massaro, who calls the weak U.S. outlook ""troubling.""The aluminum giant's Q3 EPS rose 52% to 32 cents, missing forecasts by 3 cents, as revenue dipped 6% to $5.21 billion, below expectations for $5.31 billion.

""Apple executives have given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system and decide on a final direction.""The Bloomberg article follows a similar report on Sept. 9 from the New York Times, which also said Apple had reset its car initiative with a focus on automotive technologies rather than building its own vehicle.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 72, but other stocks are more attractive. Check out the article ""Stocks To Watch: Ulta Shapes Up; Facebook, GrubHub, Domino's Rebound.""Meanwhile, other companies are aggressively pursuing self-driving car projects, including Tesla Motors (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), ride-hailing service Uber, and major automakers such as Ford (F) and General Motors (GM).Tesla has scheduled a news announcement for Wednesday, which is rumored to be about its semiautonomous driving system Autopilot or potential ""Model Y"" SUV.Some on Wall Street say Samsung's recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone will help Apple iPhone sales. But not Nomura Securities analyst Jeffrey Kvaal.In a research note Sunday, Kvaal said he sees little impact to Apple from Samsung's recall.""Our checks indicate that, to date, 80% to 90% of consumers returning Galaxy Note 7s have opted to stay within the Samsung family,"" Kvaal said. The most common replacement phone is the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, he said.The Galaxy Note 7 cancellation likely will put 16 million handset purchases in play, he said.""Apple's benefit may ultimately prove small, and hard to spot,"" he said. Apple would do well if could capture 2 million to 4 million of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 handset purchases in play, Kvaal said.Kvaal rates Apple stock as buy with a price target of 135. Apple stock slipped a small fraction to 117.53 on the stock market today.Goldman Sachs on Monday said Apple should offer video subscriptions to rekindle growth as smartphone sales mature.Internet television is ""the next key battleground"" for the company, Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski said in a report. She suggested that Apple ""go big"" in original and exclusive online video content. That would put it in competition with internet TV network Netflix (NFLX).Ideally Apple could launch a subscription bundle for $50 a month that includes the iPhone, Apple Music and an Apple television service. She called this bundle ""Apple Prime,"" in a wink to Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Prime service.""We think Apple should launch a subscription bundle as a way to reinforce iPhone loyalty and leverage it into content,"" Jankowski said. ""This strategy would help Apple fend off smartphone commoditization and position it well vs. Amazon and Alphabet as content shifts to streaming.""She rates Apple stock as buy with a price target of 124.RELATED:Apple, Google Product Leaks Proliferate, But Don't Tell Whole StoryApple Car Moving Forward, But Direction And Speed UnknownApple Seen Riding iPhone 8 ""Supercycle"" Next Year

245,ULTA,"Retail sales rose 0.6% in September, despite not much help from launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, the Commerce Department reported Friday.Sales hit the consensus forecast of a 0.6% rise overall and a 0.5% gain outside the auto sector.Last month's report, which showed that nonauto sales fell 0.1% in August, was revised to a 0.2% decline.After consumer spending slowed over the summer, a healthy recovery isn't expected to affect the Federal Reserve's timetable for rate hikes — one in December and two next year.The retail sales report reflected and shed light on evolving industry dynamics.Auto sales hit the gas in September, rising to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. While unit sales dropped from a year ago at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs performed relatively well.Sales from nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) rose 0.3% from August and 10.6% from a year ago following a rare 0.1% drop the prior month that was possibly an aftereffect of Amazon Prime Day in July.IBD'S TAKE: Health and personal care retailers have seen 7.8% year-over-year sales growth, strongest outside of nonstore retailers. Ulta Beauty, an IBD 50 stock, boosted sales and earnings forecasts on Thursday and saw its shares surge above a seven-week consolidation zone.Sales at electronics and appliance stores such as Best Buy (BBY) fell 0.9% despite the iPhone launch in mid-September. Best Buy shares are trading near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs after strong initial iPhone 7 demand and again this month as Samsung faced repeated overheating problems with its Note 7, finally deciding to end sales and production of the smartphone.Sales at food service and drinking places had been decelerating, as fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) cite pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out. But sector sales rose 0.8% in September after a revised gain of 0.7% in August.RELATED:U.S. Auto Sales Sluggish, But Top Views On Strong Truck DemandAugust Retail Sales Fall 0.3%, Worse Than Expected

246,ULTA,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

The shares were valued at $630,000.While the streaming service's shows are well-reviewed, its stock hasn't been a big hit lately, and there are several reasons why its latest breakout wasn't a winner.Netflix dipped 0.3% for the week.CFO Andrew Levy, appointed to the position last month as part of other recent leadership moves, acquired 15,000 shares of the carrier.Late last month, United named Scott Kirby as its president. Kirby had until then been the president of American Airlines (AAL).United shares rose 2.7% this week.CEO Jen Hsun Huang was active this week, with the sale and options exercise of 43,727 shares worth $2.75 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Nvidia shares lost 4.8% for the week.Director Dennis Eck acquired 11,000 shares of the specialty beauty retailer, according to a Thursday SEC filing. That follows last week's sales by CEO Mary Dillon and CFO Scott Settersten.The company recently bested quarterly expectations while issuing slightly cautious guidance. Shares on Aug. 26 sliced below their 50-day line in heavy volume, tumbling 6.1% that day.Ulta shares retreated 3.1% this week.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia and Ulta Beauty are two featured stocks on the IBD 50, a flagship screen of leading growth stocks.The action-camera maker's president, Anthony Bates, was also active in the last week with the sale and options exercise of 9,704 shares valued at $137,389.The latest Apple (AAPL) iPhone appears to have a pretty heavy-duty camera for a smartphone, and that could dissuade consumers from shopping for a GoPro, said Pacific Crest on Wednesday.Shares gapped down 9.1% vs. a week ago.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Camera Improvements Rile GoProUnited Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutDear Millennial Investor: Focus On What You Know, But Also The Stock Chart Do Male Investors Not 'Get' Ulta Beauty And The Beauty Business?

254,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reported second-quarter earnings late Thursday. A standout in an often volatile retail environment, the specialty beauty retailer beat on both the top and bottom lines, but Q3 profit guidance came in a little light, and shares are sliding in after-hours trade.Estimates: Profit was expected to rise 21% to $1.39 per share, on 21% revenue growth to $1.06 billion.Results: Q2 EPS rose 24% to $1.43. Sales rose 21.9% to $1.069 billion. Same-store sales rose 14.4% on top of Q2 2015's's 10.1% comps. E-commerce sales rose 54.9%.Prior Quarter: Q1 EPS grew 39%, the biggest increase in 14 quarters. Sales rose 24%, the best gain in 11 quarters. Same-store sales increased 15.2%. Loyalty program membership rose 25% to 19.4 million.Guidance: Ulta sees current third-quarter EPS of $1.25-$1.30, the midpoint of which is shy of consensus for $1.29. The midpoint of its Q3 revenue outlook for $1.072 billion $1.09 billion beats estimates for $1.075 billion. The company raised full-year EPS to low- to mid- 20% range vs. prior target of low 20% range, and now sees 11%-13% in comps vs. prior guidance for 10%-12%.Stock: Ulta Beauty shares fell 1.8% to 266.50 in after-hours trading. Shares closed down 0.9% to 271.45 on the stock market today.The stock hit a record intraday high on Wednesday. Ulta has been in a strong rally since early May.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty shares are extended above buy range. But several quality stocks are near buy points, including two retailers. To find that list, as well as stocks actually breaking out, take a trial of IBD's Marketsmith.What It Means: Ulta's light Q3 profit outlook is one of the few blemishes on an otherwise regular-looking — for Ulta, anyway — Q2 report, but it's possible investors believe the stock was already priced for perfection going into earnings results.On the earnings call, management said Ulta's loyalty program membership had crossed the 20-million mark, growing 27% year over year to 20.6 million members. (By contrast, Starbucks (SBUX) -- whose rewards program is generally well-regarded -- only has 12.3 million active members in the U.S. and Canada.)The company said it sees strength across all ages and demographics, but is excited about its growing millennial and teen customer base. Ulta also recently rolled out a private-label credit card as it hopes to convert some of its membership base to Ulta card users.What's Next? In the regular trading sessions following the prior three quarters' after-the-close results, Ulta shares have gapped up in big volume.RELATED:What To Expect From Ulta Beauty Earnings On ThursdayUlta Beauty Shines Amazon Armor As It Crushes Views, Ups Outlook

255,ULTA,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and others were among the notable insider trades disclosed this week.CEO Tim Cook sold 269,883 company shares this week worth $28.7 million.Some have speculated that Apple could unveil a new iPhone and Apple Watch at an event on Wednesday.

Similar sales have been disclosed over the summer.The family has said that it ""expects to sell Walmart shares from time to time in order to help offset possible further increases in its ownership percentage and to help fund charitable contributions.""Wal-Mart has begun to step up price cuts recently, a move that could potentially weigh on smaller discount rivals like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Shares rose 1.9% for the week, but failed to close above the 50-day line.CEO Mary Dillon sold 51,885 company shares this week, while CFO Scott Settersten sold 10,490 shares.The specialty beauty retailer reported second-quarter results on Aug. 25 that topped Street expectations.

261,ULTA,"U.S. stocks stepped higher midday Thursday, even as the two major indexes continued to communicate somewhat different stories.The Nasdaq advanced 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.8% each. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the NYSE and slightly higher on the Nasdaq.The different stories for the indexes involve their 50-day moving average lines. The Nasdaq is bouncing off its 50-day moving average in above-usual volume, which is bullish. The S&P 500 is stuck under its 50-day line, which suggests it is still in an uncertain position.Over the past four weeks, the market has been more of a stock-pickers market than a broadly bullish market. Plastics, chipmakers and fiber optics have done well. But oil and steel stocks have taken hard hits. IBD-style investors prefer to have a strong tailwind that lifts all stocks. Tailwinds make it easier for breakouts to advance.On Thursday, August initial public offering Airgain (AIRG) thrust 9% higher. The IPO has acted in a bullish fashion, though also wild, since debuting on the Nasdaq about a month ago.Airgain designs and develops embedded technologies for the wireless segment. The San Diego-based company will report second-quarter results after Tuesday's close. Few analysts cover the stock, but those who do expect a loss of a penny a share.

Gainers in above-average volume included cyber security specialist Gigamon (GIMO), online marketplace Alibaba (BABA), chip-equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and chip designer Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).On the downside, retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gapped down 1.5% in heavy volume. The stock broke out of a base in March and in five months rose 47%. Ulta has pulled 16% off its high over the past three weeks.

263,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports after the close of regular trade Thursday. The specialty beauty retailer has already experienced a 49% year-to-date rise in share price, so can investors expect more gains from an already high-flying stock?Earnings and revenue are each expected to rise 21% -- to $1.39 per share and $1.06 billion, respectively -- according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That would be consistent with growth rates of quarters past.Its stock has been climbing steadily higher, and Ulta shares often spike after earnings results: They rose 9.1% the day after its Q1 report in May, spiked 17.3% the session after its Q4 report in March, and popped 12.8% in one day after its Q3 results in December.The beauty-product seller fell 1.4% to 270.70 in the stock market today after hitting a record high on Friday. On Monday, Piper Jaffray raised its price target on Ulta to 290 from 250. Shares haven't dipped below their key 50-day or 200-day moving averages since the stock's post-Q4 gap-up in March.The experts on Wall Street will be particularly interested in both Ulta's loyalty program membership figures and same-store sales growth, two areas that have been strong performers.Ulta's sales at stores open for at least a year have far outpaced the broader retail landscape. The company reported 15.2% comparable-store growth in Q1, preceded sequentially by 12.5% comps in Q4 and by 12.8% comps in the quarter before that. Thursday's same-store sales will come on top of Q2 2015's 10.1% comps.By contrast, the 63 retailers that have reported earnings so far this season collectively have same-store sales growth of 1.1%, according to Retail Metrics.Driving Ulta's appeal are several factors, including an increased consumer interest in beauty products and only one major rival in the specialty beauty retail space.Beauty is the one of the fastest-growing segments in retail, NPD Group analyst Karen Grant told IBD. And ""prestige"" products -- think higher-priced products from brands like MAC and Urban Decay -- are proving to be popular, outpacing the ""mass"" or drugstore brands by sales growth in 2015.LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora is Ulta's primary competition, although the two companies differ in strategy. Sephora is a prestige-only shop, while Ulta carries both high-end labels, as well as drugstore brands such as Revlon and L'Oreal.IBD'S TAKE: It can be tough to figure out when to let go of a stock, especially when shares are climbing higher. But this profit-taking rule can help fill in the ""Missing Chapter.'' So is now a good time for investors to hop on? Or is it too late to get in on this hot retail name?Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink in a Monday note laid out the argument for Ulta's valuation.""The mega trends in beauty provide a highly compelling backdrop for growth; Ulta's position is increasingly favored among consumers and brands; and the defensibility of the model is becoming increasingly clear as the mix of prestige and mass brands coupled with a growing list of service elements is differentiated,"" she wrote.RELATED:Can Ulta Beauty And Veeva Systems Keep Win Streaks Intact?

264,ULTA,"The stock market closed higher Monday, when a couple of leading stocks broke out of bases.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.6% gain. The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Nasdaq 0.3%. Preliminary numbers showed volume fell noticeably from Friday, when Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen made a speech that fanned trading.Winners topped losers by 13 to 5 on the NYSE, a better breadth than on the Nasdaq, where advancers had a 12-to-7 advantage.Steel stocks rose after Deutsche Bank upgraded Allegheny Technologies (ATI) to buy from hold. The maker of specialty materials and components jumped 11%, ending near the 18.77 buy point of a pattern.Telecom infrastructure stocks also led, as Acacia Communications (ACIA) rose 5% in heavy trading. The stock is bouncing after taking a break last week from a torrid advance earlier this month.Medical services, outpatient care providers and hospitals were among a group of health care industry groups that also led, although biotechs and generic drug companies lagged. Utilities fared relatively better too, as the Dow utility average jumped 0.8%.Two leading stocks broke out of bases Monday.LGI Homes (LGIH) topped the 36.54 buy point of a flat base in more than double its usual volume. The homebuilder has the best combination of fundamentals and chart action among the homebuilding stocks.HealthEquity (HQY) cleared the 31.79 buy point of a flat base, although the pattern may also be interpreted as the handle of a larger base. Volume doubled the average pace for the operator of health savings accounts.But some consumer stocks were weaker. Five Below (FIVE) closed more than 2% lower, after erasing early gains. It reports earnings on Wednesday. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued lower, shedding a fraction as it tries to climb back above its 50-day moving average.On Tuesday, earnings are due from Veeva Systems (VEEV), which is an IBD 50 member; AeroVironment (AVAV), which makes unmanned aircraft and alternative energy systems; and shoe retailer DSW (DSW).The S&P Case-Shiller home price index comes out at 9 a.m. The Conference Board releases its consumer confidence report for August at 10 a.m.RELATED:LGI Homes Breaks Out; Rival Builders Near Buy Points Steel Makers Rally On China, Aerospace, Auto, Construction Demand

Revenue rose 22% to $1.069 billion, topping forecasts for $1.06 billion.…

266,ULTA,"Stocks ended mixed Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled that interest rates were set to go higher.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.3%, dragged down by Verizon (VZ) and McDonald's (MCD), and the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq edged up 0.1%. Volume rose 22% on the NYSE and 8% on the Nasdaq compared to Thursday, according to preliminary data.Yellen said early Friday that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened,"" while Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said a September increase is possible.Fitness equipment maker Nautilus (NLS) gapped up to soar more than 7% to a new high in heavy volume, rising decisively past a 21.22 buy point of a 27-week consolidation. It will join the small-cap S&P 600 index after the close Sept. 1.On the downside, computer networking stock Brocade Communications (BRCD) led the S&P 500 lower, plunging nearly 12% after its quarterly earnings report.Retailers were among the stocks hardest hit on Friday.Cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) plunged 6% in heavy volume. Ulta announced late Thursday that Q2 profit rose 24% to $1.43 a share on a 22% increase in sales to $1.07 billion.The results beat Wall Street forecasts, but Ulta's Q3 earnings forecast missed views. Ulta has enjoyed a big advance since it cleared a buy point in March, but it ended just below its 50-day moving average Friday.IBD'S TAKE: A stocks that pierces its 50-day line in heavy volume after a big advance could be in trouble. It's important for investors to learn how to handle stocks that test this key support line.Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among companies due to report quarterly earnings next week.Economic data due next week include personal income and spending for July, the Institute for Supply Management's index of U.S. manufacturing for August, and nonfarm payrolls for August.
"
267,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) beat on both the top and bottom lines in its second quarter and raised full-year profit guidance -- so why are shares down Friday?The beauty retailer has consistently delivered strong numbers. In Q2, same-store sales growth accelerated to 14.4% from 13.9% in Q1, and up from 12.5% in Q4, 12.8% in Q3, and 10.1% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Gap (GPS) and department stores like Nordstrom (JWN) have posted negative comparable sales (-2% and -1.2%, respectively, in their most recent reports).The one blemish on Ulta's Q2 was the company's earnings guidance for Q3 -- a range of $1.25-$1.30 vs. consensus for $1.29 -- which might have dampened some enthusiasm.Still, Ulta's recent track record of outperforming retail peers has started to stir some disdain, at least online. But Zacks Research Equity Strategist Tracey Ryniec tweeted that some investor-commenters on StockTwits were ""getting more hostile"" amid Ulta's success ""because they don't 'get' the biz.""When asked whether it's male investors who aren't getting it, she replied:@IBD_elow Yes. They don't understand how it can be doing that well. But don't want to learn about it either.— Tracey Ryniec (@TraceyRyniec) August 25, 2016One male commenter acknowledged not getting Ulta's business, as he regretting missing out on its stock run.$ULTA Wish I'd invested in it ages ago. I look at it as a male and I think, ""how can so much money be spent on all this nonsense?"" #stocks— Hugh J. Robbins (@HughJRobbins) August 26, 2016Ulta shares were down 6.1% to 254.85 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day average for the first time since March. The stock is still up around 38% so far this calendar year.IBD'S TAKE: Got in on Ulta before this year's run but not sure if you should sell? IBD University has a few tips on when to take profits.The reaction from Wall Street analysts has been more positive. Nomura upped its Ulta price target to 287 from 244, and Cowen raised its target to 286 from 265 late Thursday following earnings, days after Piper Jaffray bumped up its target to 290 from 250.Lofty expectations appear to have gotten the better of Ulta on Friday, particularly as its previous three quarterly reports have prompted big gap-ups. And analysts note that high valuation is prompting some investor pushback.""We believe Street's high expectations were likely already priced into the shares ahead of the solid print, and we would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on the stock.Meanwhile, other Ulta metrics continue to shine. Its loyalty program grew about 28% to 20.6 million active members during the quarter, well ahead of other strong loyalty players such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has 12.3 million active U.S. and Canadian members at last count.RELATED:Ulta Beauty EPS Guidance Is Blemish On Priced-For-Perfection Stock

268,ULTA,"Stocks were still in the red early afternoon Friday, after giving up early gains as traders focused on Fed comments out of Jackson Hole, Wyo. IBD 50 stocks, including Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and NetEase (NTES), were active.The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.3%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2%, and the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower. Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Thursday.Early Friday, Fed chief Janet Yellen said the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened,"" while Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said a September increase is possible.Retail stocks dominated the downside in the stock market today, with specialty and consumer electronics taking the hardest hits. Ship transporters, fiber optics and gold miners advanced.Fiber-optics company Acacia Communications (ACIA) bounced 6% in fast trade to stem a three-session slide. The IBD 50 stock and recent new issue is up more than 350% from its May 13 offering price.Other IBD 50 stocks on the rise included Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) and NetEase, up north of 4% each. Silicon Motion is attempting to recover its 50-day line after a five-session decline. NetEase, meantime, struck a new high and is back in profit-taking range from a 179.20 buy point.

290,ULTA,"After venturing into positive ground, U.S. stock indexes went slightly negative Thursday as the market ventured into afternoon trades.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were down marginally while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.4% gain. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges.Blue chips were about evenly split, but Caterpillar (CAT) rode the brake on the Dow, as the construction and mining equipment maker's stock dropped 1.5% in strong volume. The company's report on retail machine sales -- for the three-month rolling period ended in July -- disappointed the bulls. Sales reported by dealers fell 43% in Latin America; 20% in North America; 13% in the Europe, Africa and Middle East region; and 7% in Asia.Caterpillar broke out of a base in July. The stock is in the 5% buy zone above a 80.99 buy point. The stock's annualized dividend yield is 3.6%. Caterpillar's EPS Rating is 17, which means 83% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster. In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks by fundamentals and technicals, four stocks rose for every one that fell. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was one of the better performers. The stock thrust to a new high, rising about 1.6% in strong volume. Ulta is up about 44% from a March breakout. In Q2, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) expanded its stake by 72%.The biggest losers in the IBD 50 were two China-based stocks. NetEase (NTES) was down nearly 3% in heavy volume despite a strong quarterly report, and e-commerce company Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) fell 2.1% in fast trade.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the Oil & Gas-Drilling group led with a 3.5% pop. Within that group, Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN) retook its 50-day line with a 6.4% jump. Houston-based Patterson is working on a pattern and is only 4% off its high. The potential buy point is 22.32. The stock, though, has a miserable EPS Rating of 9 and is expected to lose money this year and next year.West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures advanced almost 3% to just over $48 a barrel. The price of oil has been rising since early August.IBD'S TAKE: To see which growth companies are leading the market, the IBD 50 is a great place to start.

298,ULTA,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further."" Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

"
300,ULTA,"A common pitfall for new and experienced investors alike is to buy a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's ""acting right."" Fundamentals are top-notch, there's a compelling growth story, and the stock is in a bullish setup.Sometimes, the strategy works. Other times, it can end badly, especially if the stock gaps down on earnings.Buying shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) when it was in a cup-with-handle base ahead of its July 21 earnings report turned out to be the right call. Shares gapped up on the news. But it didn't work out with Mobileye (MBLY) recently when shares crashed 8% on the day it reported its quarterly results. The company delivered another strong quarter of earnings and sales growth, but news that the company would be ending its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) rattled investors.IBD recently introduced an options strategy to limit risk around earnings. The strategy provides a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the risk of a negative reaction to an earnings report. Weekly or monthly options can be used -- so long as the cost for the option is right.The options market might sound a bit daunting, but the strategy isn't complicated.First, look for stocks at or near proper buy points. Most will be building bases. After that, look for a slightly out-of-the-money weekly or monthly call option. This means the strike price is just above the underlying stock price. Every strike price comes with a premium, or the cost of the option. Divide the premium by the stock price, and multiply by 100; this gives you the downside risk for the trade in percentage form. Looks for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.The strategy is detailed every week in the Earnings Preview column of the IBD Weekly edition on page B2. Several stocks featured in recent weeks delivered nice options wins.One of the early winners was Nvidia (NVDA), featured in the May 9 edition of IBD Weekly as it got support at the 10-week moving average. When shares were trading around 35.50 on May 12, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 36 strike price (May 13 expiration) came with a premium of $1.27. That offered a trade with 3.6% downside risk.Shares gapped up May 13 on earnings and closed at 40.98. The option could have been exercised that day at 36. If you didn't want shares, you could have sold the option itself for a nice profit.Other winners in recent weeks included Salesforce.com (CRM), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), Paychex (PAYX), Yum Brands (YUM) and Domino's.Of course, earnings option plays aren't always going to work, but they're a lower-risk alternative to buying a stock outright ahead of earnings because risk is predefined.
"
301,ULTA,"Will seeing the world the way a millennial sees it make you a more successful investor? There may be no right or wrong answer. After all, investing is a complex game that transcends generational differences.The factors of success are many. They include knowledge, discipline, diligence, determination, courage, humility, emotional control, market timing and luck -- just to name a few. It's probably fair to say that a 75-year-old does not have a monopoly on all of these qualities any more than does a 25-year-old, and vice versa.Yet in a world of constant change, Americans in their early 20s to mid-30s today generally share a heightened consciousness about what impact corporations are having on the world. Men and women of the digital generation expect, in the main, to get any information at their fingertips; they feel the impact of news around the world acutely, and naturally wish to respond more directly to a wide range of social, environmental and humanitarian issues.Some investment experts strongly believe, then, that how the millennials invest their assets, including those they inherit in the future from baby boomers, will impact the long-term returns of public companies.""If you think about their obsession with social media, they self-identify with brands very much as a reflection of who they are as a person,"" Christina Alfonso, co-founder and CEO of New York-based advisory and analytics firm Madeira Global, told IBD in a recent interview. ""They want to be associated with things that are more sustainable as a brand or product.""Alfonso worked in the private wealth management industry on Wall Street before starting Madeira with a partner five years ago. Her company has grown to a staff of 10. She's hired scientists and analysts to help family offices, private equity firms and other clients evaluate investments that were made to make a positive impact on society.The terms SRI (socially responsible investing) and ESG (environmental, social, governance) are now part of the mainstream vocabulary of the investment world. Alfonso notes that two-thirds of large corporations give an annual sustainability report. Income inequality, pollution and climate change are top-drawer issues. On the home page of Starbucks.com, ""responsibility"" is the fourth word on the main navigation bar.Members of the millennial generation ""don't have the luxury to wait around to solve these problems,"" Alfonso said. ""Investing is not neutral. Ultimately, where you put your money says something about you.""Certainly, companies that are emphasizing a lighter environmental and more positive social impact have thrived. The stock of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Motors (TSLA) may be bouncing around in a wide range since last summer's peak at 286, yet it's still up sharply since it broke out of a long base at 40.10 in the week ended April 5, 2013.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which ranks high in the IBD 50, notes on its website that it requires all vendors to comply with the cosmetics and skin- and hair-care product retailer's ethical standards regarding forced labor and human trafficking related to the manufacturing process.""If ULTA discovers that a vendor is not in compliance with the expected ethical standards, which include the elimination of human trafficking and forced labor within its supply chain, ULTA will provide such supplier with the opportunity to remedy any potential noncompliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan,"" the company writes on its website. ""If the supplier fails to remedy the noncompliance, ULTA reserves the right to eliminate such vendor from its supply chain.""So, will IBD add an eighth letter to its CAN SLIM acronym for smart growth stock investing? Will CAN SLIM become CAN SLIMS, with the second S standing for ""social""? In a word, no.Jerry Dodson, the head of $16.5 billion Parnassus Investments' family of mutual funds, points out that investing purely on social objectives alone does not guarantee success. Earnings power, sales growth, good management and a competitive edge are all important factors.He recounts a story when one of his firm's funds decided to invest in the supercomputer company Control Data. ""They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK,"" Dodson said in an interview in July 11's IBD Weekly. ""We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.""The Parnassus funds screen out companies that extract, explore, produce or refine fossil fuels. The funds favor companies that provide outstanding workplaces that include benefits such as profit-sharing and time off for volunteer activities and parenting. The Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX) fund ranked No. 1 in the category of ESG over the past 10 years through June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return, according to Morningstar. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% gain over the same time span.

Analysts expected 17 cents diluted EPS and $520.95 million sales.It was the second quarter in a row that Express' earnings fell short.President and CEO David Kornberg said in a statement that foot traffic at Express mall stores was disappointing and that ""this was compounded by a lack of clarity across the assortment."" Kornberg said he believed the company's fall assortment ""is more cohesive across our wearing occasions.""Still, Express expects Q3 diluted EPS of 9-15 cents, while Wall Street had forecast 32 cents. The company's earnings will be impacted by $105 million-$110 million in capital expenditures this year as it reorganizes and rolls out new lines to boost sales.For the full year, Express guided for adjusted EPS of $1-$1.14, well below consensus for $1.46.Express shares closed at 11.94 in the stock market today, after falling intraday to their lowest levels since May 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Although specialty retailers such as Express are struggling amid intense competition from Amazon.com and an overbuilt sector, there are exceptions. For example, cosmetics and beauty supplies retailer Ulta Beauty boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. Ulta Beauty reports earnings Thursday.

322,ULTA,"Art instructor and mother of three Amy Frankson has cut back on her trips to Pavilions supermarket from three times a week to maybe three times a month. For the most part, her groceries — including perishables like eggs and milk — are now dropped off at her doorstep in green totes marked ""AmazonFresh.""Her household used to rack up about $300 in weekly supermarket receipts from Pavilions, a Safeway chain. Now Frankson's family spends about $200 a week on groceries, and buys an estimated 85% from the Amazon's fresh-grocery home-delivery service. There's also the convenience factor.""If I order it in the morning, it could be there by dinner time,"" she said from her home in Newport Beach, Calif.Shoppers like Frankson have Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and others scrambling to get ahead of Amazon (AMZN). The e-commerce giant has swallowed up segment after segment of the retail business and spit out bookstores, electronics retailers and clothing chains along the way. Now Amazon hungers to pile groceries onto its plate.And millennials, who are finally starting to form their own households, could accelerate Amazon's push into refrigerators around the world.In fact, even as Amazon rolls out new shows on its streaming video service and new gadgets with artificial intelligence, some analysts believe everyday groceries could deliver the biggest boost to its revenue.Amazon shares have pulled back a bit after hitting new highs earlier this month but were up 0.1% at 744.86 Friday. The stock is up 10% so far for 2016, compared with the S&P 500's 6% year-to-date gain.Wal-Mart rose 3 cents to 73.55 on Friday, and Kroger edged up 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's earnings report next week could propel the stock even higher. Here is how investors could have approached Amazon's earlier run-up and why the lowest stock price isn't always the best.For now, Amazon controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen. Kroger's 9% market share puts it at a distant second, and Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.But when it comes to online grocery sales, Amazon is already No. 1, bagging a 22% share in 2015 vs. Wal-Mart's 13%.First tested in Seattle almost a decade ago, AmazonFresh has quietly popped up since then in about a dozen cities along the coasts. They include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore and New York.A new offensive has brought Fresh back into public focus. The service recently launched in Boston and across the pond in London.An Amazon spokesperson said the company does not comment on its product roadmap.""We're branching out as fast as we can while being careful not to sacrifice the quality and convenience our customers expect from AmazonFresh,"" says Amazon's help page.To shop on AmazonFresh, customers have to sign up for Prime Fresh, a higher-tier Prime membership that costs $299 annually. At $200 more than a regular Prime subscription, the service isn't exactly cheap, but Frankson said it ""definitely pays for itself.""Gen Xers like Frankson and her husband, Brian Mackerer, both 42, are contributing to growing online-grocery penetration. According to a recent Cowen analysis, 16% of surveyed 35- to 44-year-olds used such a service in February. As for millennials, the firm found that 21% of 25- to 34-year-olds had bought groceries online, with 28% pegged as ""likely future buyers.""""Particularly with a younger generation, there's no desire to drive to a store and push a cart down an aisle and load heavy items and stand in line at checkout and then throw stuff in your trunk or in bags on the bus or whatever and take it home, when there are other more convenient options,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian told IBD.Fellow tech titan Alphabet, meanwhile, has taken a different route with its Google Express service, positioning itself as a courier between residents and nearby stores like Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), rather than a direct competitor.Google Express memberships cost $95 a year or $10 a month; nonmembers are charged $4.99 per delivery. It's available in a sprinkling of cities across the country. Cold grocery delivery is only featured in parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Perhaps mercifully for legacy players with established supplier relationships and infrastructure, the complex fulfillment strategy associated with fresh food is slowing down Amazon's grocery takeover.Handling produce and perishables is a whole different animal at an Amazon fulfillment center. There are temperature checks, quality requirements and inspections, according to an MIT report cited in Cowen's analysis. Plus, just like at the supermarket, bags have to be packed with extra care to ensure that berries are not smashed and eggs aren't cracked.Why bother with a low-margin business that has difficult logistics?Because people go grocery shopping about four to five times a month, and the added operating income dollars outweigh the unattractive margins, say Blackledge and Chen. Plus, it lures shoppers into Amazon's Prime ecosystem.""For (Amazon), we think the purchase frequency fits well with the Prime value proposition and the incremental operating-income (dollars) offset the low-margin profile,"" they wrote, adding that Amazon will benefit from scale and logistics expertise, among other things.That should translate to billions more dollars at the top line. The Cowen analysts estimate the U.S. food and drink market is Amazon's ""biggest category for upside impact to revenue and/or"" gross merchandise volume. They see the company's grocery volume shooting up to $23.2 billion five years from now from an estimated $8.7 billion this year.Of the additional spending that goes to online food and beverage sales in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021, Blackledge and Chen think Amazon alone will capture 38% -- and that's a conservative forecast.Longtime food suppliers to grocery stores are expected to hop on board the Amazon train as shopping habits shift, margins be damned.""At this point, a lot of suppliers realize Amazon is absolutely a must — a channel they have to be on, even if it comes at the expense of their margins,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The amount of velocity and product sales you're going to get through Amazon, you absolutely have to be a partner in some way.""When it comes to online grocery shopping, traditional grocery bigwigs are throwing everything to the wall to see what sticks, including partnerships with last-mile delivery services like Instacart or features such as in-store pickup.""It's very clear that all of those players are looking for a solution,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton. But which solution works best is still a mystery.Target (TGT) has been testing online grocery delivery in Minneapolis. Kroger shoppers can use ClickList to order online and pick up in a store, or Vitacost.com to order health foods and vitamins for home delivery. Wal-Mart offers curbside delivery pickup in dozens of markets, and has plans to expand.Of the major players, market leader Wal-Mart ""appears to be the farthest along with future-proofing, in our view, with online grocery pickup up in 20 markets now and adding an additional 22 this year,"" according to the Cowen report. It noted that Wal-Mart sees online grocery pickup as a ""key growth strategy"" for its U.S. stores and online business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.At a Deutsche Bank consumer conference in mid-June, Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs sounded bullish on the company's online grocery prospects, while noting that its shoppers may in fact prefer in-store pickup over home delivery.""(Customers) like — while they're out — being able to come pick up their groceries,"" he said. ""So it's an area that will evolve a lot. We think we have a good competitive position where we're at, and I think it'll be a big part of our future.""Costco, on the other hand, doesn't care for the ""order online, pick up in store"" model. Instacart and Google Express enable home delivery of certain perishables and other items, but Costco mostly wants customers to pay its warehouses a visit.""We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up,"" said CFO Richard Galanti during the company's Q2 earnings call in March. ""Maybe that would change if we were having minus-3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term.""Whole Foods Market (WFM) has taken its relationship with Instacart up a notch. The specialty grocer announced in March that it would roll out in several new markets over the next year, in addition to the 17 metro areas that it already serves.But for Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and the like, AmazonFresh isn't the only worry.Meal-kit services like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver pre-measured ingredients along with a recipe, are a ""fast-growing market"" and an ""incremental headwind"" to the specialty grocery space, according to Naughton. He said 25% of people who say they shop primarily at specialty grocery stores have tried home-delivery meal kits.Indeed, Frankson said Blue Apron is ""eroding"" what is left of her family's need for Pavilions. She has also tried snack subscription box Graze, but said she was ""not crazy about all the snacks and they just piled up.""Amazon has its nose in that, too. Tyson Foods (TSN) will debut a meal-kit delivery service, Tyson Taste Makers, in partnership with AmazonFresh later this year.But for some people — and some foods — the in-store experience will continue to be essential.A Nielsen global study found that 61% of poll respondents think going to a supermarket is ""enjoyable and engaging,"" and 57% believe the act of grocery shopping is ""a fun day out for the family.""Plus, people get picky about their produce.""There's still an element of consumers wanting to touch and feel what they're buying,"" said Hottovy. ""I think that's still the biggest hurdle for them in becoming a major disruptive player.""Frankson, however, is ""very happy"" with AmazonFresh's produce.""They don't give me dodgy-looking avocados,"" she said.

324,ULTA,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) new rewards program doesn't care about points or dollars, but it does very much care about how often you visit every month. But that set-up could limit the program's appeal to casual Chipotle customers, says an analyst who reiterated a sell rating on the stock.Chipotle's new short-term loyalty play -- unlike those offered by Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and others -- is looking to bring back repeat customers in the wake of devastating same-restaurant sales brought on by a series of food-borne illness outbreaks.Under its three-month-long Chiptopia Summer Rewards, which runs from July through September, four visits with entree purchases -- not just a drink or a side of beans -- in one month confer ""Mild""-level achievement, i.e. one free entree.Eight entrees a month gives Chipotle customers ""Medium"" status (and another free entree), and 11 entrees earns ""Hot"" status (and yet another free entree).That's relatively generous: Jack in the Box (JACK) burrito chain Qdoba Mexican Eats essentially has a buy 10 entrees get one free, while Freebirds World Burritos lets customers get a free burrito for every $150 spent.But diners have to come back to Chipotle on different days to earn rewards, so making multiple purchases in a day doesn't translate to more freebies. That means that buying four entrees on one visit still counts toward one visit and is worth less than buying three entrees on three different days.Adding another layer of complexity, earning any of the three status levels for three straight months during the promotion period unlocks more freebies, such as catering for 20 people.The program encourages return visits instead of dropping big bucks. While Starbucks rewards customers on a per-dollar basis (a recent change from its per-visit rule), and allows users to rack up ""stars"" over time, Chipotle's rewards levels all reset at the start of each month.The structuring of the program likely has some ties to the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks late last year that scared off customers -- first-quarter comparable-restaurant sales for the March-ended period plummeted 29.7%.Chipotle's complex-but-generous rewards program risks giving away a lot of free burritos and goodies for already-paying customers, but not attracting lapsed or new diners.Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson reiterated a sell rating and 285 price target on Chipotle in a note discussing the rewards program:""We acknowledge that the rewards offered by the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program are not as extreme as the free and buy-one-get-one burrito giveaways instituted earlier in 2016, and may succeed in getting the 'Chipotle loyalist' to make incremental purchases. Nevertheless, we believe that this promotion does not offer much for the larger population of less frequent Chipotle customers (according to a July 2015 study by market research firm Technomic, only 43% of CMG's customers visit more than once a month), and that the company may need to take additional promotional measures in the coming quarters to bring these customers back.""Few other retail loyalty programs operate on a per-visit basis. Starbucks customers kicked up a fuss when the newest changes were unrolled, but they continue to sign up in droves -- and Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in February that the new program would prompt people to spend more money.Specialty beauty retailer Ulta Beauty rewards shoppers with a point per dollar, offering $3 off per 100 points earned, with up to $125 off for 2000 points earned. And American Express (AXP) last year introduced a cross-branded program that includes Macy's (M), AT&T (T) and other companies.Chipotle shares fell 3% to 388.78 on the stock market today, the worst close since July 2013 and just above a recent intraday low. The restaurant chain reports Q2 results on July 21. Jack in the Box lost 2.7%, Starbucks 1.8%, and Ulta lost 1.7%. The broader S&P 500 was lower by 1.8%.RELATED:Starbucks 'Star' Bucks Gain Currency Beyond Its Shops

332,ULTA,"Stocks surrendered most of their early-morning advance by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, as the U.K. referendum on retaining or rejecting membership in the European Union grew closer.Meanwhile, Emergent BioSolutions (EBS) plunged nearly 19% to about 32 to 31.05 as volume soared approached 8 million shares vs. its float of 33 million. The anthrax vaccine firm's average daily volume over the past 50 sessions is 451,000 shares.The Nasdaq composite let an early 0.7% wither to a fractional gain. The S&P 500 faded to trade just a hair positive, while the small-cap S&P 600 traded lower.The Dow Jones industrial average also shed early gains and was 0.1% lower, led by McDonald's (MCD), the only member of the 30-stock average to fall nearly 2%. The world's largest burger chain gapped down at the open and was testing buying support at 120, a psychologically key round number.Notice how on a daily chart, the stock was beginning to live beneath its 50-day moving average, which flattened out in May.McDonald's is expected to grow Q2 profit by 11% to $1.40 a share, which would mark a fourth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. But sales continue to wither, and Wall Street sees Q2 sales slimming by 3% to $6.29 billion.Emergent, a leader in vaccines against the bioterrorism agent anthrax, is falling after news that the U.S. government has issued two solicitation notices for the development of vaccines for its strategic stockpile. Reports noted that the Department of Health & Human Services does not specifically state the number of vaccine doses to be procured each year.The stock had formed a somewhat sloppy base that began with its Dec. 30, 2015, peak at 40.49. The four-month base featured a triple-bottom look, which is generally a flaw. Still, Emergent staged a breakout past a 38.69 early buy point on April 6 in big volume. That eventually led to a 14.7% gain through its peak of 44.38 in early June.Amid the current choppy market, a good sell rule these days is to sell more quickly on the way up; so rather than wait for a 20%-to-25% gain to emerge, an investor can take at least partial profits in a position at 10% to 15%. In the case of Emergent, a second key sell signal emerged on June 17, as the stock sliced sharply below its 50-day moving average in volume 47% above average. In the following two sessions before Wednesday's big spill, the stock barely rebounded in light volume, a subtle sign that its character had changed.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, top-ranking stocks Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Dycom (DY) fell mildly in ultra-light trade -- that's the right combination of price-and-volume action you want to see when a good stock takes a break. Dycom, a solid play in the telecom infrastructure space, is still in buy range from a recent new handle buy point of 86.14.As seen in Tuesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook was downgraded from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure."" This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower, given the increased intensity of professional selling. The S&P 500 recently saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to 5, while the Nasdaq composite's count is currently at 4.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

334,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Chief Executive Mary Dillon made clear Tuesday that while prestige brands are enjoying a period of growth, the specialty beauty retailer has no intention of straying from the high- and low-end assortment of cosmetics, skin care and hair care products that has made it so popular.When asked at Oppenheimer's 16th Annual Global Consumer Conference about potentially adding more prestige brands to stores, Dillon replied, ""One might ask, 'Why would we do that?' """"We really believe the magic of our proposition is we're not going to be shifting and becoming so predominantly prestige,"" she said, emphasizing the strength of Ulta's curated mix of prestige and mass brands.While not explicitly naming Sephora, Dillon said that Ulta might add slightly more prestige products, but it is ""important to know that we won't ever dramatically continue to shift"" Ulta's product mix toward a more heavily high-end assortment. LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora, Ulta's main competitor in the specialty beauty space, does not carry mass brands like Revlon or L'Oreal.The company also touched on its real estate strategy, with Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten telling investors that a ""theoretical perfect co-tenant mix"" largely includes off-pricers like TJX's (TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx and shoe seller DSW (DSW).""We love to be near Target (TGT) stores, historically, but we've seen our stores in all types of different environments,"" he said.The sluggishness of the broader retail space hasn't extended its tendrils to buyers of cosmetics and beauty products, and Ulta's e-commerce numbers are hopping. First-quarter e-commerce sales alone grew 38.8%, and overall same-store sales rose 15.2%, year over year.""(E-commerce) is clearly very fast-growing for us, (a) small percentage of our business today,"" said Dillon. ""We obviously expect that to grow a lot -- it will probably be double what it is today over the next few years. And it's a constant area of focus and attention.""Ulta shares closed up 0.1%.RELATED:Ulta Beauty Shines Amazon Armor As It Crushes Views, Ups OutlookUlta Beauty's Amazon-Resistant Model Impresses Wall Street.

"
345,ULTA,"Stocks stuck to small moves in early-afternoon trade Friday, but Alphabet (GOOGL) is attempting a new breakout after its Feb. 2 attempt ended in flames.The Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, were each off less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials edged roughly 0.1% lower. Volume climbed on both exchanges due to expiring weekly and monthly options.If the listless movement continues, both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 are likely to finish the week with firm gains; both indexes in fact notched closing highs for the year on Wednesday as IBD's Market Pulse outlook flashed a change in the market's current outlook to ""uptrend resumes"" from ""uptrend under pressure."" This means that the environment for high-growth stocks breaking out with success is more positive. Still, all losses in any stock investment must be managed well -- that is, cut the loss at a maximum 7% to 8%.The Dow utility average stood out in the stock market Friday, rising nearly 0.7% and likely to finish the week up as well. Water supply names boosted the market's upside as the group gained more than 1.5%. Aqua America (WTR) jumped more than 2% in light volume and retook its 50-day moving average. It boasts a 2.3% yield and an excellent 5-year Earnings Stability Factor of 5 from IBD on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (volatile).It's been a solid week for mega-cap techs. Following the footsteps of a breakout by e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet is trying to put a 777.41 handle buy point in its rear-view mirror. The stock is up 0.4% to 778.61, minimally past that proper entry in a 10-week cup with handle. Volume is running at a below-average pace, but it is likely to pick up next week when Alphabet reports Q1 results after the close on Thursday.Alphabet's latest cup with handle is highly unusual in that the left side of the cup was formed in the space of just four days. Normally, that would be a big flaw, due to asymmetry of the base. However, one could argue that Alphabet has been digesting recent gains since the end of December, when the stock dropped quickly. The shares rebounded quickly and tried to break out past a 798.79 cup entry, but that cup was clearly flawed; at four weeks long, the stock failed to meet the minimum length of proper cup bases at six weeks, and it had a V-shaped look. Great cup bases have a rounded contour, just like the silhouette of a porcelain tea cup.Thanks in part to cost discipline enforced by CFO Ruth Porat, Alphabet has been able to more effectively leverage its steady low-double-digit revenue growth into amazing bottom-line gains. Plus, EPS growth has been accelerating, going from 5% to 17% to 18% to 28% in the past four quarters, respectively. That compares with revenue gains of 12%, 11%, 13% and 18% over the same period.The world's No. 1 search engine has branched out into new fields, including driverless vehicles. However, the overwhelming majority of its revenue still stems from online and mobile advertising. Wall Street sees Q1 profit rising 23% to $7.96 a share on an 18% boost in revenue to $20.3 billion.Alphabet's after-tax margin in Q4 last year was 28.3%, up from 25.7% in the year-earlier period. The stock earns a highly justified A rating for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity) from IBD Stock Checkup.Elsewhere in the market, consumer sector leaders continued to thrive. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) slipped almost 1% to 203.80 but remained headed toward its fourth up week in a row. The beauty products retailer is extended from a recent cup breakout past 188.58. Ulta also boasts a maximum 99 Composite Rating from IBD. Its current fiscal first quarter ends in April.

347,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has toppled Sephora to become the favorite beauty destination of average-income teen girls, says Piper Jaffray, which highlighted Ulta's rewards program and hiked its price target to 220 from 188 following the results of its semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens poll.Ulta now has 27% share among average-income teen girls vs. 15% in the previous spring, and it has gained popularity even as it sits in the No. 2 spot behind Sephora among more affluent female teens.Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink, who also raised her fiscal 2017 and 2018 profit estimates on Ulta, wrote that the price-target increase reflects confidence in the company's position as a share-gainer, as customers ""shift from legacy to emerging purchase environments.""Mass merchandisers, department stores like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and drugstores like Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) are no longer the de facto places to buy cosmetics and skin care products, as Ulta, LVMH's (LVMUY) Sephora and even Amazon's (AMZN) beauty offerings have grown in popularity.While teens are spending less than they used to in general, they are nevertheless willing to shell out money on beauty products, with beauty wallet share hitting a new high of 10.5% among upper-income female teens. Beauty spending rose 20% from last year among more affluent teens, the firm said, with growth in all areas: makeup, skin care and fragrance.Wissink specifically called out Ulta's rewards program as a successful lure for return customers.""From surveys of both women and teens, the single common thread is that beauty spending is rising, and the shift to specialty and (e-commerce) formats is accelerating,"" wrote Wissink in a separate note on Ulta. ""Ulta's loyalty program is a key asset, driving frequency and reinforcing a growing content library to inspire brand discovery, test & trial, and basket value.""The company's Ultamate Rewards program now has over 18 million members, with over 80% of sales coming from those customers.Shares of Ulta were up 1.7% in the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of LVMH climbed 2.5%. Macy's and Nordstrom rose less than 1%, while Walgreens and CVS fell fractionally.And there's room for more share gains in the beauty space.""Ulta and Sephora represented over 50% of destination preferences but only 10% of industry share, implying significant runway for growth,"" she said.RELATED:Ulta Beauty’s Amazon-Resistant Model Impresses Wall StreetWhy Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.

353,ULTA,"Amazon (AMZN) is dominating many retailers, but there are two names in particular that are holding their own as the e-commerce giant grows: Costco (COST) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).In a report out Thursday, Cowen said it continues to see Costco as an “un-Amazonable retail concept,” as the wholesale superstore reported a 4% rise in May comps, which was in line with estimates.After an earnings beat last week, the analyst said Costco’s “superb price/value, luxury product and streamlined assortment helps drive a sustainable high-margin membership stream.”Cowen has also said Ulta is “un-Amazonable,” while other analysts have noted Amazon’s lack of strength in the beauty products space as well.Costco fell 0.7% in above-average volume Thursday, dropping back below its 200-day line but finding support at its 50-day line. The stock has struggled to stay above its moving averages since attempting to retake those levels after reporting earnings. Shares are trading 10% below their high reached in December.And Ulta hit a new all-time high in light turnover before paring its gains to close up 0.2%. Shares are now extended 26% from a breakout past a consolidation base buy point cleared in March, meaning they’re in a profit-taking zone.Meanwhile, traditional retailers like Macy’s (M) and Target (TGT) are feeling the heat from Amazon.Macy’s has been able to climb off of its May 18 low, reached in the wake of a weak earnings report, but it’s still trading 53% below its 52-week high. Shares closed up 4% Thursday.Target is trading 20% below its 52 week high, and down 0.1% Thursday.

Small-caps outpaced the general market, sending the Russell 2000 ahead 1.2%.The stock market today wrestled with mixed trade. Volume rose 7% on the NYSE, relative to action at the same time Thursday. But the Nasdaq's advance came in weak support, with volume slipping 7% below Thursday's morning levels.In economic news, the Commerce Department reported businesses saw wholesale inventories contract 0.5% in February.

375,ULTA,"The already-depleted Sector Leaders list held up relatively well through Friday and Monday's global sell-off, but investors should not be smug if some of their positions remain strong.

"
378,ULTA,"Charcoal cleanser. BB creams. The 10-step Korean skin-care regimen.The modern woman's bathroom counter likely looks very different from her grandmother's, and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) knows it. Stocked with both higher-end prestige products and value-focused mass brands, the specialty beauty retailer has carved out a unique space for itself amid offerings from department stores, drugstores and the ever-looming 800-pound gorilla, Amazon (AMZN).While the beauty shopper of yesteryear might have frequented a favorite department store cosmetics counter for all her Estee Lauder (EL) or Lancome supplies, today's consumer doesn't feel as tied to specific brands.""The beauty bag is more diverse -- so there's category loyalty and interest but there is less buying across a single brand range,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. The average shopper is ""mixing and matching brands more routinely.""As brand loyalty wanes, the rising concept of ""destination loyalty"" may begin to matter more, particularly as a plethora of competitors vie for attention, including not just department stores like Macy's (M) or privately held Saks but drugstores like CVS Health (CVS) and big-box retailers Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Ulta and rival Sephora, owned by Paris-based LVMH (LVMUY) have become the reigning specialty stores in the beauty space. Sephora lines its glossy black-and-white shelves only with prestige brands such as Dior, Nars and Yves Saint Laurent, while Ulta offers a mix.Conventional drugstore brands like Revlon and L'Oreal are featured alongside edgier titles at Ulta, such as Smashbox and Urban Decay. Ulta also offers both a full-service salon in every store and ""brow bars,"" or eyebrow treatment areas, at some of its almost 900 locations.Traditionally, customers who opted for a department store makeover would have to ""go home and try to figure out how she did it,"" said Wissink. But makeup trends once relegated to the service model are now accessible online and via other venues.Now, anyone can simply hop on YouTube and look up, say, a video tutorial from beauty guru Michelle Phan on contouring -- highlighting and shading facial features to the cosmetically challenged -- or head to their local Ulta for a makeup consultation.The sample-friendly ""test-and-trial"" nature of specialty beauty stores -- minus the salesperson pressure -- appeals to shoppers who want to experiment with a new look. Ulta has ""floating artists and salespeople who can talk intelligently about a beauty trend who aren’t (commissioned) to sell you a specific brand,"" said Wissink.""You might be buying a $3.99 compact of glittery eye shadow and a $49 base compact and putting on $7 mascara,"" said Wissink. ""That’s the Ulta way.""Ulta also has a rewards program, offering samples and perks in exchange for shopper loyalty. The Ultamate Rewards program membership has grown to over 18 million members, and those members offer the company precious insights into their shopping habits, including frequency of salon service use, spending patterns, favorite products, and other data.""That’s very valuable information,"" Ulta Beauty Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten told IBD. ""It helps us position new stores, where we’re going to build those stores -- we like to go where we already have an existing customer base, so it’s very valuable.""In a bid to capture and keep customers, the company has been shifting from discounts and delving into direct email marketing with personalized messaging. Its hold over shoppers is proving to be strong: More than 80% of the company's sales come from loyalty program members, said Chief Executive Mary Dillon in last August's earnings call.Ulta's online sales, while a single-digit fraction of its overall net sales in 2015, has been growing at a 40% to more-than-50% clip every quarter without weighing on same-store sales.""It’s been incredible,"" says RBC Capital markets analyst Brian Tunick of Ulta's e-commerce growth. ""It’s been one of the biggest parts of the story. But at the same time, their store comps have been high single digits as well. In retail today, there’s not a lot of companies that are showing positive store traffic.""In the fourth quarter, reported on March 10, Ulta's e-commerce sales leapt 44.2%, while retail-only comps rose 10.4%. And the company's per-share profit climbed 25% to $1.69 on 21% revenue growth to $1.27 billion, both beating consensus estimates. Ulta also announced an accelerated share buyback program.Ulta shares continue to float in buy range after breaking out of a period of consolidation on March 11, gapping up past the key 50-day and 200-day levels.Following the results, a bevy of analysts upped their price targets, including those from Piper Jaffray, Nomura, RBC and Jefferies, though concern over the stock's apparently full valuation lingered.""We continue to like the strength of the business model, ULTA's unique market positioning and future growth prospects,"" wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik in March. ""However, we believe valuation already prices in these positives.""Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel called out the company's accelerating comps amid share gains in low- to -mid-tier markets. ""We continue to expect that with minimal mall and (e-commerce) penetration, ULTA remains isolated from the main issues facing retail as the company’s self-help initiatives drive ongoing top- and bottom-line growth,"" Siegel wrote in a note to clients last month.Any talk of e-commerce typically leads to talk of mega-retailer Amazon. But even after the online one-stop shop and known brick-and-mortar killer set up its own storefront in 2013, Amazon Beauty, the beauty space has not been subject to as much disruption as some initially feared.A mild assortment of higher-end brands means the e-commerce giant is still at a disadvantage to specialty players when it comes to the top-shelf stuff. And while one might think that Amazon would be a perfect place to conveniently restock supplies, most cosmetics and skin care shoppers actually like being in stores to play with samples and try out new makeup techniques.That appeals to Ulta's core customer, the ""beauty enthusiast and beauty enthusiast on a budget,"" says the company's Settersten.""(They're) not so prone to this replenishment concept, so when you think about our e-commerce business it’s not people just necessarily price shopping or looking for convenience,"" he said.Plus, consumers can't exactly get a haircut over the internet.""(Ulta is a place to) have your hair done, your nails done, your eyebrows waxed,"" said RBC's Tunick. ""That’s what’s unique here.""

389,ULTA,"Stocks traded mildly higher in the first half hour of trading Tuesday following decent data showing that both personal income and spending in the U.S. rose in April. Meanwhile, Chinese internet giant Sina (SINA) broke out, rising past a 51.90 aggressive entry within a long, deep cup-with-handle-style base.The Nasdaq composite edged almost 0.3% higher, while the S&P 500 gained nearly 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Biotechs helped push the Nasdaq higher as the Nasdaq Biotechnology index rallied 1.4%.Income grew 0.4% for the month in April, meeting the Econoday forecast, while spending jumped 1%, smashing the 0.7% expected gain. The PCE index, a measure of inflation, rose 0.3%, meeting views. Meanwhile, the latest Case-Shiller survey of 20 key cities showed home prices rising 0.9% in March, above the consensus forecast for a 0.7% lift. Year over year, prices rose 5.4%, also beating views.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gave up less than 1% after last week's nearly 12% surge in huge volume. The fast-growing retailer has made a strong gain since its November 2014 breakout from a long base at 121.53. Last week it posted a 39% jump in Q1 earnings per share as revenue rose 24% to a Q1 record $1.07 billion.Sina, a key source of web content for a gigantic base of Chinese-language internet users, rose 4% to 53.40, so the stock is within buy range from the 51.90 handle buy point. The 11% slide in the week ended May 13 proves how volatile this mid-cap play can be. Revenue growth slowed in Q1 to 8% vs. gains of 14%, 14% and 21% in the prior three quarter, and Sina posted a net loss of 4 cents a share in Q1. However, the Street sees Q2 profit rebounding 150% to 15 cents a share.Workday (WDAY), an expert in HR management software, rose nearly 0.8% to 76.57. It's slated to report fiscal Q1 results today after the close. The Street is expecting a loss of 2 cents per share despite revenue growing 35% to $338.7 million. Workday has created a long double-bottom base with an 85.77 buy point but has also encountered stiff resistance near the 80 price level.Steel stocks gained ground after the U.S. Commerce Department late last week jacked anti-dumping tariffs on corrosion-resistant steel products imported from China, India, South Korea, Italy and Taiwan, with China seeing extra duty of up to 450%.U.S. Steel (X) gained more than 3% to 14.84 but is still deep within a bottoming base. In a bottoming base, a stock has made an extremely deep decline, usually 50% to 80% or more off its high, but is starting to show signs of bottoming out while forming a base that presents an opportunity for stock to break out to 52-week highs. Numerous bottoming bases formed within the tech sector in the aftermath of the 2000-2002 dot-com crash.Nucor (NUE) gained 1% to 48.99. It's just 4% off a 52-week high and has formed a long cup with handle with a 51.20 buy point.As seen in the latest Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend, which means an investor may buy breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points with a reasonable amount of risk.Do you know if your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

392,ULTA,"Staying on top of the stock market involves more than knowing whether the stocks in your portfolio are rising or falling.What else is there to check? How about a sector count of the IBD 50?The IBD 50 is a computer-generated list of the stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technicals. Breaking down the IBD 50 with a sector count can give you an idea of where the strength resides in the stock market.In the list published in IBD Weekly for the week of June 13, the sector breakdown looked like this: Nine stocks from the medical sector; six in software; five each in retail, building and chips; and three for internet. Other sectors involved only one or two stocks.The first question we might ask is this: How does this compare with the IBD 50 lineup at the start of the year?At the end of 2015, there were eight medical stocks; six from the software sector; five in finance; four each in retail and business services; and three each from banks and chips.At first glance, there appear to be similarities. The medical, software, retail and chip counts stayed about the same.However, we need to ask a second question: Has rotation occurred within the sector?The medical sector shows the biggest change, despite an essentially unchanged count. For example, at the end of 2015, the biotechs were well into a downward trend. Former leaders such as Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) peaked in the first half of 2015. By the end of 2015, only three biotechs were in the IBD 50. And in the recent IBD 50, two biotechs made the list, but they were not the big winners of the previous up cycle. The two stocks are Medivation (MDVN) and Emergent BioSolutions (EBS).Could they be leaders of a biotech rebound? Possible but unlikely: Only four biotechs have a Composite Rating of 90 or better -- the two mentioned above, along with Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) .Software stocks have been a steady story. Four software stocks in the IBD 50 at the end of 2015 are still in the list. In the building sector, only one stock made the IBD 50 at the end of 2015. Now there are five, but none of them are homebuilders.Retail is a mix of fresh names and old names. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were in the IBD 50 at the end of the year and are in it now. Two stocks left the list -- Alibaba (BABA) and Starbucks (SBUX).Alibaba has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 65, meaning that a hefty 35% of the market is outperforming the China-based stock. Also, earnings growth decelerated over the past three quarters, and the Street has revised annual earnings lower for this year and next.Starbucks also has struggled since departing the IBD 50. The RS Rating is a miserable 37. Annual earnings revisions, however, are upward. Quarterly earnings growth has been steady, though revenue growth has stepped down.The other current retail stocks in the IBD 50 are Five Below (FIVE), Copart (CPRT) and Dollar General (DG).Sometimes a sector check won't lead to many big conclusions. Aside from the rotation in the medical sector and the increase in the building sector, the changes appear minimal.
"
393,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is sitting pretty as its loyalty member program grew 25% from the prior-year Q1 to 19.4 million members, and CEO Mary Dillon sees the beauty sector as being ""insulated"" from factors hitting retail as a whole.While she didn't go into much detail about the specific factors impacting retailers, it's not news that Amazon (AMZN) and other online players are eating into brick-and-mortar market share.Ulta management told analysts on a call Thursday that the chain has about 3% of U.S. beauty market share, so there's ""certainly"" more room for growth. And it is banking on its expanding ULTAmate Rewards program to help, with over 80% of sales being fueled by loyalty program members.Ulta shares jumped 8% in late trading.Specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and LVMH's Sephora have been deemed un-Amazon-able by some analysts, and Ulta continues to outperform amid a grisly retail earnings season. Loyalty programs and the in-store test-and-trial nature of cosmetics help to fortify defenses against the e-commerce assault that has taken chunks out of many other areas of retail.Ulta crushed first-quarter expectations, with earnings up 39% to $1.45 per share, way above consensus views for EPS of $1.29 and the greatest earnings growth in more than three years. Revenue grew 24% to $1.07 billion, easily topping estimates for $1.03 billion in sales.Same-store sales rose 15.2% during the quarter, accelerating from Q4’s 12.5% gain and well above views for a 10.7% increase. E-commerce sales alone jumped 38.8%. Retail comps grew 13.9%, which included salon comp growth of 7.7%.Dillon said in a statement that the company was ""off a phenomenal start to the year."" During the call, management overall sounded pretty happy with the company's loyalty program, brick-and-mortar performance and growth potential.For Q2, the company sees EPS of $1.32-$1.37 on $1.041 billion-$1.058 billion in revenue — a mixed bag, given views for EPS of $1.40 and sales of $1.033 billion.For the year, Ulta boosted guidance -- citing the strong start to the year -- to low-20% EPS growth on high-teens percentage range sales growth, up from prior outlook for 18%-20% EPS growth and mid- to high-teens percentage range revenue growth.Current Wall Street estimates are for a 20% EPS increase on 17% revenue growth.Ulta also now expects 10%-12% in same-store sales growth, up from previous guidance for 8%-10%.

394,ULTA,"The country's top funds ramped up their buying of building stocks in May, as the market's signal turned green in the second half of the month with a confirmed uptrend outlook.In the stock market rally, building stocks have emerged as fan favorites among top-performing funds. They include Universal Forest Products (UFPI), U.S. Concrete (USCR), Drew Industries (DW), Chase (CCF), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Masco (MAS) in their latest reporting periods.Other industrial materials stocks acting well include metal fabricators Gibraltar Industries (ROCK) and Insteel Industries (IIIN).Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsBig computer software firms such as NetEase (NTES), Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Citrix Systems (CTXS) were also on top funds' radar.A handful of retail stocks have turned higher from recent lows, including discount variety store Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), pool equipment supplier Pool (POOL), salvage vehicle auctioneer Copart (CPRT) and specialty beauty and cosmetic guru, Ulta Beauty (ULTA). Thirty-five leading funds added the beauty firm, investing an estimated $147 million in their latest reporting period. The $14.3 billion JPMorgan Large-Cap Growth Fund (OLGAX) added the stock to its portfolio.IBD found 29 best-performing funds loading up on U.S. Concrete, investing an estimated $39 million. The $1.9 billion Oppenheimer Discovery Fund (OPOCX) owned a small position.The Euless, Texas-based firm makes ready-mix concrete and related products for commercial, residential and public works construction. U.S. Concrete groups its products into two main categories: Ready-Mixed Concrete and Aggregates.U.S. Concrete has benefited from improving municipal and state budgets, boosting construction activity in large metropolitan cities and core markets of San Francisco Bay area, New York metro area, Washington D.C. area and Dallas Fort Worth area.The stock is forming an elongated handle of a cup-with-handle base. It's trading within range of its buy point of 59.50. As of Friday, IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete group was ranked No. 23, down from 17th place three weeks ago.It's been growing the company through acquisitions. In 2015, U.S. Concrete completed eight acquisition and will continue to seize buying opportunities to solidify its products and services moving forward. Earnings growth has accelerated 457% and 158% the past two quarters on solid double-digit revenue growth.Leading funds have been unloading big tech firms, NCR (NCR), Intuit (INTU), IBM (IBM) and HP (HPQ) in their latest reporting periods.

395,ULTA,"When it rains, grab an umbrella. The managers of $799 million Oppenheimer Discovery Mid Cap Growth Fund (OEGAX) are applying that adage about finding shelter in a storm to their mutual fund.Amid a blah macroeconomic environment, they've been betting that the few companies capable of generating superior growth will be increasingly attractive to investors. Those are the stocks they are aiming for, according to their March 31 commentary.Hasbro (HAS), the world's second-largest publicly traded toy company, was a key contributor to fund performance in the first quarter. It was helped by holiday-season sales of toys based on the big success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" a film that was released in December.Q4 sales rose 13% as earnings per share climbed 14%. Hasbro has quickened its pace. Q1 revenue rose 16%, driving an 81% EPS surge. EPS have grown three quarters in a row.Shares are up 29% so far this year, going into Friday.The stock has a 2.4% dividend yield. And it as a 99 Composite Rating from IBD.The stock got powerful free advertising in recent days. Texas mom Candace Payne donned a mask depicting ""Star Wars"" character Chewbacca that emitted the Wookiee’s trademark growl every time Payne opened her mouth. A video of Payne laughing hysterically as the mask growled -- dubbed ""Happy Chewbacca"" -- was posted on Facebook (FB), drawing over 140 million views as of Tuesday.As IBD reported, Piper Jaffray said the video could drive sales of 1 million units or more of the $30 mask, generating 2 to 3 cents of near-term EPS for Hasbro.Kohl's (KSS) posted a video of Payne and her family, further promoting Hasbro products.Then Payne appeared on CBS’ (CBS) ""The Late Late Show,"" recreating her viral video hit, with host James Corden and ""Star Wars"" director J.J. Abrams also wearing the Hasbro-made masks.The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Comp Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.Seven of the fund's top 10 holdings as of March 31 had Comp Ratings of 80 or higher. So did eight of the fund's 10 top new buys.Trading around 256, top-10 holding Acuity Brands (AYI) is extended from an earlier entry at 225.28 and from an alternate entry at 242, as IBD's markets team points out. The stock has a 98 Comp Rating and a dividend yield of 0.2%.

396,ULTA,"It's now working on a new flat base with a 260.93 buy point. Its Accumulation/Distribution is neutral at C, but the rating is offset by a strong up/down volume ratio.The supplier of lighting products is seeing strong demand. On April 6, Acuity reported earnings per share in the February-ended fiscal second quarter of $1.80 a share, up 53% and nicely above analysts' consensus estimate of $1.51. Sales rose 26% to $777.8 million. Analysts were modeling $752.3 million.Ulta Salon (ULTA), another top holding, is up 14% so far this year.
"
397,ULTA,"Ulta has a 99 Comp Rating.In after-hours trading, Ulta jumped 7% after the big-box cosmetics retailer reported that fiscal Q1 profit rose 39% to $1.45 a share on a 24% increase in sales to $1.07 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.29 in per-share profit on $1.03 billion in revenue. EPS grew 22%, 22% and 27% in the previous three quarters.Ulta, which rose 1% to a new high during the regular session, has climbed out of buy range following a March breakout past a 188.58 buy point.Previously, the beauty segment has been lauded as Amazon (AMZN)-proof by analysts who cite the strength of Ulta and Sephora’s loyalty programs and the fact that customers like to sample cosmetics in-person.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a top new buy, is suturing up gains within the medical sector. The company is debt free.After EPS shrank in all four quarters of 2014 and grew just 1% in Q1 2015, it has grown at a double-digit pace in four frames since then. Revenue grew 7%, 12% and 12% the past three stanzas.Intuitive Surgical was not hurt by a May 12 U.S. District Court ruling that, if upheld, would bar government payments of billions of dollars to insurance companies participating in ObamaCare, enabling the insurers to reduce customers' out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles for low-income people.Shares of many insurance-oriented health care stocks went down after the decision.Ronald Zibelli Jr. took the fund's helm on June 5, 2007. Justin Livengood has been on the job with him since early 2014. The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner among midcaps for outperforming the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.The fund's 7.36% average annual gain over the decade going into Thursday ranks in the top 35% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peers averaged 6.81% and the S&P 500 averaged 7.36%.Over the past three years the fund outperformed 86% of its peers. So far this year, its 0.30% loss tops 44% of its direct competitors.

400,ULTA,"A busy morning of headlines fueled modest gains for the major averages early Friday, even as FEI Corp. (FEIC), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) made double-digit moves.The Nasdaq added 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial gained 0.2% apiece in the stock market today. Volume was light ahead of the Memorial Day weekend.In deal news, lab-equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) agreed to buy FEI Corp., a maker of high-end electron microscopes, for $4.2 billion in cash. Earlier this year, Thermo Fisher completed its acquisition of Affymetrix for just over $1 billion. Shares of Thermo Fisher edged higher on the news. FEI soared 14%.Early gainers in the Dow included Nike (NKE). Shares rose nearly 1%, but they are nowhere near a proper entry after several weeks of institutional selling. Earlier this week, competitor Under Armour (UA) inked an exclusive 15-year sponsorship deal with UCLA worth an estimated $280 million.On the earnings front, a couple of IBD 50 components made nice moves.Ulta Beauty soared 10% after reporting accelerating earnings and sales growth late Thursday.Veeva Systems, meanwhile, jumped 10% after the software firm delivered its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth.

"
401,ULTA,"Wall Street analysts say specialty beauty retailers such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH’s Sephora are immune to the charms of Amazon (AMZN) and other online pure-plays. Amid the recent retail earnings carnage, will that stay true when Ulta reports Q1 results on Thursday?Analysts expect 24% profit growth to $1.29 a share on 19% revenue gains to $1.03 billion, on the upper end of Ulta’s previously provided Q1 guidance.While the apparel space slumps, makeup and skincare have been hot sellers. Macy's (M) acquired specialty beauty brand Bluemercury in 2015 and plans to open 42 more Bluemercury locations in fiscal 2016.Likewise, JCPenney’s (JCP) in-store Sephora locations were one of its best-performing divisions in Q1.Among women and teens, beauty “continues to gain wallet share,” Piper Jaffray said in April, following its teen survey.Specialty stores’ loyalty programs, plus the test-and-trial nature of cosmetics, are keeping customers coming back.“Ulta and Sephora provide a place to play. ... It’s like a good glass of wine.” Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink told IBD in December.Ulta shares gapped out of a consolidation on March 11, surging 17% to a new high after the retailer's last earnings report. Shares continued to climb to 212.92 on April 27. Ulta closed down 1.2% at 206.02 on Monday.RELATED:Ulta Beauty’s Amazon-Resistant Model Impresses Wall StreetWhy Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.

Sales climbed 23.7% to $1.073 billion, topping estimates for $1.03 billion. Comps jumped 15.2%.Analysts have praised the cosmetics retailer, whose in-store salons, loyalty program and vast array of offerings have enticed customers to return and try out new products, rather than buy their supplies on Amazon (AMZN).A jury ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet, rejecting a $9 billion copyright claim from Oracle, deciding that Alphabet’s Google had made fair use of Oracle’s Java code. Oracle had argued that Google needed a license to use its Java programming language in its Android mobile operating system. The legal case, which began in 2010, revolved around Google's use of Java APIs.Oracle plans to appeal the jury verdict.Oracle had won partial jury verdict in 2012, but a judge threw out the ruling.Alphabet stock rose slightly in late trade.

Splunk guided Q2 revenue to $198 million-$200 million, the midpoint just below consensus views of $199.4 million.Shares fell 6% in after hours trading after closing up 1% at 54.93.Veeva Systems, a cloud-based life sciences software developer, reported a 25% rise in first quarter earnings per share to 15 cents, beating analyst forecasts by 4 cents.

404,ULTA,"As drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA) on Tuesday helps to ring in a new earnings season, ETF investors await more than its latest quarterly results.They're hoping for insights on the retailer's proposed merger with rival Rite Aid (RAD). Signs of progress could send Walgreens stock higher.Investors in exchange traded funds have a pressing question about the broader consumer discretionary sector, too. When this S&P 500 sector is expected to show earnings growth leadership in 2016, why is it lagging in the stock market?Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) is up 2% year to date through April 1. By comparison, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) jumped 16% in the same period.Yet in the recently concluded reporting season, the consumer discretionary sector posted an impressive 11.53% earnings-per-share growth over the year-ago quarter -- ahead of all S&P 500 sectors except telecommunications services.""This (discrepancy) may partly reflect the sector's outperformance in 2015,"" Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in a recent note.Indeed, that strong showing factored into Miracle Mile Advisors' decision to get out of the sector in the middle of 2015.After a strong run, consumer discretionary and retail stocks had looked fairly valued, said J.J. Feldman, portfolio manager at the Los Angeles firm, which manages roughly $500 million.Miracle Mile also expected defensively oriented sectors to hold up better if the market pulled back. The decision to tilt towards utilities and consumer staples paid off in 2016's volatile first quarter.XLY has rebounded nicely amid a broad stock rally in the last month, rising 4.4%. However, Feldman's still cautious about consumer discretionary and retail stock ETFs.""We're not looking to enter until it gets a little bit cheaper,"" said Feldman. ""It's a valuations call.""However, both recent economic data and recent policy moves are supportive of domestically oriented sectors, such as retail. These include job gains, emerging signs of wage growth and a Fed that's in no hurry to raise interest rates.""Consumers have money in their pockets to spend"" when mortgage and auto loan rates are low, said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research.And in an earnings recession, the consumer discretionary sector is holding up fairly well. It's expected to see a 1.4% EPS decline in first-quarter earnings and a 2.5% decline in first-quarter revenues -- better than most S&P 500 sectors and subsectors, according to Zacks estimates.""The only concern I have is that consumers have not really been spending, despite low gas prices,"" Mishra added. What Americans have been willing to spend on is leisure and entertainment activities. That helps to explain the wide dispersion in the consumer discretionary sector.For example, Market Vectors Gaming (BJK) and SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) are up 7% year to date. XRT invests in companies that own and operate big-box general merchandise, drug, grocery, department, automotive, apparel, and specialty retail stores.Besides Walgreens and Rite Aid, XRT's 98 equal-weighted stock holdings include highly rated IBD stocks such as parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), discount retail store Five Below (FIVE) and beauty chain Ulta Beauty (ULTA). This ETF has a smaller-cap skew than XLY.Investors seeking to invest in this sector should look for stock holdings that benefit from rising consumer trends, such as online shopping and home improvement, Mishra advised.The two largest stock holdings in XLY and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR) are Amazon (AMZN) and Home Depot (HD). Amazon and Home Depot have soared 62% and 21% in the past year, respectively.Miracle Mile managers are more likely to invest in XLY than XRT when they decide to dive back into the consumer discretionary sector.""We tend to go towards more household, blue-chip names,"" Feldman said.

Germany's DAX soared 3.5%, the Paris CAC-40 gained 3.3% and London's FTSE added 1.7%Despite the stock market's strong gains, Friday's session was curiously light on breakouts.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) barely cleared a 580.10 buy point in light volume. Shares rose 1.2%.Alaska Air (ALK) cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 78.59. Shares jumped nearly 6% in solid trade. The handle area can be seen on the daily chart but not the weekly chart. Ideally, it's good to see a clear handle on both a daily and weekly chart.In earnings news, Nasdaq 100 component Ulta Beauty (ULTA) soared 17% after reporting strong earnings and giving bullish guidance late Thursday.China-based stocks also did well in the Nasdaq 100. JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and Ctrip.com (CTRP) all rose 3% or more.Elsewhere, fast-growing China Lodging Group (HTHT) jumped nearly 10% as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base.

418,ULTA,"Utilities and consumer staples raced past most sector equity ETFs this year, but investors shouldn't get stuck in a defensive-minded, dividend-focused rut.""Consider cyclical sectors over defensive and high-dividend-paying sectors,"" BlackRock advises in its latest Investment Directions note. As of December 2015, BlackRock managed $4.64 trillion, more than any other investment firm in the world.Both utilities and consumer staples are vulnerable to rising yields, which BlackRock anticipates over the intermediate term as inflation expectations pick up.Consumer staples look particularly unattractive to the firm's strategists, with valuations appearing stretched despite the earnings stability of companies such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola (KO).""As the global growth outlook improves, we think cyclical stocks give more bang for the buck,"" the BlackRock team of global investment strategists wrote.Which sectors in particular? They're overweight consumer discretionary and technology.Job growth and low energy prices are fueling revenue and earnings momentum for consumer discretionary companies, including retail, media, automobile and leisure businesses. The sector is expected to deliver the best earnings growth among all sectors.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) has gained 4.3% so far in 2016 through March 23, making it a best-performing consumer discretionary ETF.

449,ULTA,"Some investors may bemoan the mediocre performance of stocks in the retail industry. The retail sector is ranked No. 17 out of 33 sectors as of Wednesday's IBD.

"
450,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares rocketed late Thursday following a comfortable fourth-quarter beat and strong guidance, though recent indications point to Amazon (AMZN) gaining beauty market share.The beauty retailer's earnings climbed 25% $1.69 per share in Q4, well above forecasts for $1.54 a share and an acceleration from the previous quarter's 22% EPS growth. Revenue rose 21% to $1.27 billion, topping estimates for $1.23 billion.Same-store sales, which include online sales, grew 12.5% during the quarter.Ulta also announced a $200 million accelerated share buyback program.Shares popped 13% in late trading after logging almost 2.8% growth during the regular session. As of Thursday's close, the stock had still been trading below two key levels: its 50-day and 200-day lines. Shares now look to retake those averages.Ulta's e-commerce sales alone climbed 44.2% during the quarter. Specialty beauty-product sellers like Ulta and LVMH's (LVMUY) Sephora have been forging ahead in the online retail space as they build out market share in the real world. Unlike Sephora, Ulta also carries mass drugstore brands like Revlon and L'Oreal in addition to prestige makeup and skincare products.Despite the crushing power that Amazon appears to wield against traditional brick-and-mortar shops, Ulta and Sephora still appear to be popular destinations for beauty shoppers.Loyalty programs, the need to try cosmetics in person, and a satisfying in-store experience have all helped Ulta and others maintain sway over consumers, analysts have previously told Investor's Business Daily.“We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and Ulta Beauty’s highly differentiated offering that propels our business to transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape,” said Ulta CEO Mary Dillon in a statement Thursday.For fiscal 2016, Ulta is targeting ""mid to high teens percentage range"" total sales growth and 18%-20% EPS growth. Wall Street sees 15% earnings and revenue growth for the year.Ulta anticipates growing online sales ""in the 40% range"" in 2016.For Q1, Ulta sees 9%-11% comp growth and EPS of $1.25-$1.30 EPS on sales of $1.016 billion-$1.033 billion. Analysts expect EPS of $1.22 on revenue of $1.012 billion.Cowen & Co. has previously pegged the beauty space as an ""un-Amazon-able"" retail proposition, whose emotional connection to shoppers offers a viable path vs. Amazon.But that path may become more difficult. A new survey from Piper Jaffray, published this week, says that Amazon gained share among respondents as a preferred beauty destination, reaching 10% after lagging behind at 3% only two years ago. Wal-Mart (WMT) remains first at 30%.

452,ULTA,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list. Foot Locker (FL), which carries both Nike and Under Armour in its stores, also made the cut.Starbucks (SBUX), for its part, isn't afraid of a slowdown in China. The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

Sales rose 30% to $43.6 billion. Shares rose 3%.Inside the IBD 50, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) looked poised to halt a three-session slide. Shares gained 3%. More than 80% of IBD 50 components are below their 50-day lines, including Ulta.In the financial sector, Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 2%. The investment bank turned to a profit from a loss during the period, and earnings easily topped consensus projections. Revenue declined less than expected.Cruise line operators outperformed in heavy volume. Royal Caribbean (RCL), Carnival (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) delivered gains of 1%-2%.Earnings season picks up momentum this week, with IBM (IBM), Netflix (NFLX) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all scheduled to report after today's close.

456,ULTA,"Discount retailer Big Lots (BIG) reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and offered guidance that was ahead of its earlier outlook, managing to post positive results for the period while others in the sector were faltering.Big Lots earnings grew 37% to 82 cents a share on 2.5% revenue growth to $1.31 billion. That was ahead of analyst views for 70 cents earnings per share and $1.3 billion in sales.Same-store sales at outlets open more than a year during the quarter rose 3%. The value-store chain sells food, furniture, household items and electronics.For the second quarter, Big Lots expects 42-47 cents earnings per share and flattish to 2% gains in same-store sales.For the year, the company guided per-share profit to $3.35-$3.50, up from an earlier outlook for $3.20-$3.35, and affirmed guidance for low-single-digit same-store sales in fiscal 2016.Shares shot up 14.1% to 50.95 in the stock market today, blasting out to a 14-month high and nearly setting an all-time bestBig Lots' well-received results come on the heels of Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) eye-popping quarterly earnings, proving that it's not entirely a retail wasteland out there. Off-price retailer TJX (TJX) has proven to be another star in an otherwise bleak segment. Ulta Beauty shot up 9% after its late Thursday report, while TJX advanced 1%.Value retailers Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI) are on tap to report in the upcoming week.

457,ULTA,"Investors this week learned to stop worrying and love the rate hike. Even as Fed officials and fresh economic data bolstered the case for a summer interest rate increase, stocks rallied. Apple (AAPL) and banks continued to climb, while energy stocks took heart from $50 oil. Top-rated Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and deep-discount stores shrugged off retail earnings woes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) kept spinning. Alibaba (BABA) disclosed an SEC accounting probe, while Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC) won key court battles.Odds for a Federal Reserve rate increase at the June or July meetings continued to climb, but stocks rallied. The Nasdaq rose 3.4%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Dow industrials 2.1%, with all three regaining their 50-day lines as the market direction returned to a confirmed uptrend. Apple advanced 5.4% after climbing 5.2% last week. Financial and energy stocks also rallied, with the latter rising along with oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $50 a barrel Thursday, a seven-month high, as U.S. inventories and production fell. Crude rose 3.3% for the week to $49.33.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who has been among the more dovish policymakers publicly in recent months, said Friday that raising rates cautiously would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months as the economy continues to improve. Earlier in the week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he sees two or three rate hikes this year, with three or four more next year. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated that the U.S. job market is tight and may start to push inflation higher -- cause for another rate hike. Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said the benchmark rate could go up soon, but weak productivity growth could curb further increases.While odds of a rate hike at the June policy meeting are about 33%, the chances for at least one quarter-point hike by the July meeting are above 60%.Economic data largely backed calls for a rate hike. New-home sales spiked 16.6% to an eight-year high, while pending-home sales shot up to their best level in 10 years. Durable goods orders rose 3.4% on soaring aircraft demand, but the report also showed core capital goods bookings slid to a five-year low.In the coming week, May data on manufacturing (ISM index), U.S. auto sales and employment may lock in expectations for or against a Fed rate hike.Automaker-tech pairings continued. Toyota (TM) said it will invest an undisclosed amount in Uber after last year disclosing plans to invest $1 billion in R&D on self-driving cars. Toyota will offer auto leases to Uber drivers. BMW i Ventures said it will invest in Scoop Technologies, creator of the Scoop carpooling mobile app. Volkswagen (VLKAY) will invest $300 million in Gett, an Uber rival in Europe and New York City. The trio join Apple, which in early May said it would invest $1 billion in top China ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing as it reportedly works in secret on an Apple Car project. (Didi itself is backed by Alibaba and Tencent (TCEHY), while Uber partners in China with Baidu (BIDU)). Also, General Motors (GM) in January said it would invest $500 million in Lyft, an Uber rival.The specialty beauty retailer continues to be an outperformer among a field of retail disappointments. Ulta Beauty notched a 39% EPS gain -- the biggest in three years -- on 24% revenue growth to $1.07 billion, way above views. Ulta also amped up its full-year outlook. Q2 guidance was mixed. More retailers are scheduled to report this week.

Find out at IBD Stock CheckupDollar-or-less variety store chains Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates Thursday amid strong expansion. Dollar General reported a 23% EPS gain and plans to open 900 new stores this year. Dollar Tree reported a 25% EPS advance. One troubling sign was that both fell short of Wall Street revenue targets. Still, Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said he was generally pleased with the company’s performance in “what continues to be a challenging economic environment.”Dollar General stock leapt 10.1% this week, and Dollar Tree gained 15.7%, both breaking out to new highs.Alibaba disclosed an ongoing SEC investigation into potential violations regarding the e-commerce giant’s transaction and consolidation practices, as well as its operating data from Singles Day, the Chinese company’s most lucrative shopping day of the year.Shares plunged 6.8% Wednesday, Alibaba’s worst one-day percentage decline in more than a year.

(CSC), a move the company said would create a $26 billion global IT behemoth. HPE, itself a spin-off of Hewlett-Packard, also kept its full-year EPS guidance above views.HPE stock rose 15.1% for the week. Computer Sciences spiked nearly 41% to a six-month high.Bank of America, Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks are back on the hook for a potentially crippling sum of cash after a U.S. appeals court overturned a 2013 lower-court ruling against antitrust lawsuits that alleged the banks rigged Libor and hurt investors. The lower court found the plaintiffs didn’t show sufficient harm, but the appeals court felt the opposite. Now the lower court will deliberate further on the matter and decide whether the plaintiffs are justified to sue at all.That same appeals court overturned a $1.27 billion suit against Bank of America that alleged the bank’s Countrywide Financial misled mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) on loan sales in the run-up to the financial crisis. The court said Countrywide’s actions were likelier to fall under ""breach of contract"" rather than outright fraud.

The No. 2 cybersecurity firm's fiscal Q2 sales grew 48% year over year to $345.8 million, topping Wall Street for $339.5 million.

463,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) may well become more attractive to the millennial crowd going for a healthy lifestyle with the addition of the eco-friendly and safe Honest Beauty makeup and skin-care line in select stores starting this month.That's one of the points that Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen made in a report this week on Ulta, a one-stop shop for beauty and salon products at a variety of prices.The report follows Ulta's announcement that Honest Beauty's makeup and skin-care collection will be available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores as well as on its Ulta.com website starting this month. The 250 stores comprise around 29% of Ulta's store base, Chen noted.The company describes the Honest Beauty line, created by healthy lifestyle brand The Honest Company, as a collection of ""safe, high-performance"" products that feature naturally derived botanical ingredients such as chamomile, calendula, aloe vera and barbary fig.""We like Ulta's announcement to carry Honest Beauty in select stores and online,"" Chen noted in his report. ""Honest is a growing brand (with) a unique, healthy lifestyle proposition. We believe Honest is a well-known brand with broad appeal to millennials, given the strong brand proposition (and) emphasis on transparency, responsibility and effectiveness. This likely will resonate with both the millennial and post-millennial's personalized, authentic lifestyle.""Chen notes that the near-term upside to same-store sales stemming from the addition of the Honest Beauty line in select Ulta stores will be small at first.He expects Honest Beauty to likely be less than 1% of Ulta's sales, given that Ulta carries 500-plus brands and more than 20,000 products vs. Honest Beauty’s roughly 80-piece collection.""We believe Honest will be a positive traffic driver and underscores Ulta's commitment to carrying the most compelling brands,"" Chen added.Prior to the Ulta launch, the Honest Beauty makeup and skin-care collection was only available on honestbeauty.com and in one retail outlet at The Grove, a Los Angeles shopping venue.""We believe Honest Beauty and The Honest Company could take share from bigger players, as their niche brand proposition continues to gain loyal customers,"" Chen added.He cites those ""bigger players"" as Proctor & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB).Ulta offers products ranging from high-priced so-called prestige brands sold in department stores and specialty stores to lower-priced labels sold via the mass channel, including drugstores and discounters.""Securing the initial distribution of Honest Beauty is one more way we believe Ulta can gain market share through their unique balance of prestige, mass and private-label brands,"" Chen added.

465,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which operates stores offering personal care products and salon services, has been a bright spot in a dim market. The stock has retaken a 175.88 buy point and is just 4% off an all-time high. Furthermore, its relative strength line continues to trend higher.Ulta is benefiting from gradual improvement in the economy and from troubles at rivals such as Macy's (M). The biggest U.S. department store operator said earlier this month that it was closing 40 stores due to lackluster holiday sales.By contrast, Ulta opened 45 stores in the latest quarter.""We continue to look quite favorably upon Ulta's prospects and view store rationalization in the department store space as another positive"" for the company, Oppenheimer said Jan. 8, rating the stock outperform. ""In our view, Ulta is well positioned to garner at least a portion of the business"" from Macy's store closures.Ulta leads the specialty retail industry group with a Composite Rating of 97 out of a best possible 99.Ulta initially cleared its buy point Dec. 4 after a better-than-expected earnings report for the fiscal third quarter that ended in November.Profit for the period rose 22% to $1.11 a share on a 22% gain in sales to $910.7 million. Both were in line with the company's three-year profit and revenue growth rates of 24% and 21%, respectively.Sales at Ulta Beauty stores open at least 14 months rose nearly 13% in Q3 from the same period a year earlier, while revenue from salon services jumped 20% and e-commerce sales soared 56%.Yet investors considering buying Ulta now should remember that its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has slipped to C- and its up/down volume ratio stands at 0.6, indicating net selling by institutional investors.

Shares are trading 14% below a consolidation buy point. They're up 2.6% today.The shoe retailer has a 93 Composite Rating.Edwards Lifesciences has a 94 Composite Rating.

The stock is now just 3% below an 83.53 flat-base buy point. But the stock fell 4 cents to 80.16.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Ross Stores (ROST) and Campbell Soup (CPB) are among other IBD 50 members working on bases.While breakouts provide buying opportunities, the current market environment warrants a cautious outlook.

The S&P 500 added nearly 0.2%, and the Nasdaq edged up 0.1%.

471,ULTA,"Just like a basketball team needs solid players at all positions to win, many key factors go into a successful breakout. If a team has a weak center, it won't matter much even if the point guard is strong.Likewise, a stock can show good price action, but weak upside volume or a lagging industry group can get in the way of a potentially powerful breakout.""It is the unique combination of your finding stocks with big increases in sales, earnings and return on equity plus strong chart patterns revealing institutional buying that together will materially improve your stock selection,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""""The best professionals use charts,"" he added. So why not make like the pros and hone your chart-reading skills?There are many factors to consider when looking for stocks to add to your watch list. The prior four columns covered a number of key fundamental and technical gauges.To review, investors should focus on quality stocks. They should set a minimum stock price of $10 a share. Stocks they consider should also trade at least 400,000 shares daily on average.They should be one of the top players in its industry group, which should also be outperforming. On the technical front, the stock should be trading above its 50-day moving average ahead of a breakout.Today we'll focus on a couple of more key traits to look out for when studying a stock's chart.When a stock is building a base, you'll ideally see tight trading in quiet action.Volume should rise as the stock works on the right side and at the breakout.Heavy volume in the midst of the base, especially with wide and loose price action, is what you don't want to see. Quiet trade as a stock consolidates is good; it indicates the big money is holding or building a position. But big downside volume shows unwillingness among fund managers to hold shares.To help determine if a stock is showing quiet action in a base, you can compare weekly or daily volume vs. the 10-week or 50-day moving average. The up-down volume ratio (in Stock Checkup at Investors.com) indicates demand for shares, too.It's best to stick with stocks that have an up-down volume ratio greater than the neutral 1.0 level. A high ratio indicates institutional investors are grabbing shares.Leaderboard stocks can make good watch list candidates. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) displayed tight, quiet trade in its flat base ahead of its Jan. 23 breakout. One of the fastest growing players in the retail industry, Ulta joined Leaderboard on Jan. 22.When it started basing in early December, there were five days of above-average trade. The heaviest volume occurred during a Dec. 18 decline, but was still relatively tame at 35% above usual (1).No more big-volume days came until Ulta broke out past a 134.60 buy point Jan. 23, rising 2% in volume that was 67% heavier than average (2).It was trading above its 50-day line before the breakout and led its Retail-Specialty group with a 99 Composite Rating.After a brief pullback right after the breakout, Ulta has trended mostly higher; shares are currently up 22% from the breakout.

The retailer earned $1.11 a share, up 22%. Sales climbed 22% to $910.7 million.The company raised its forecast for the full 2015. It sees sales growth in the low 20% range, from previous guidance of a mid- to high-teens, and comparable-store sales gains of 10% to 11% from 8% to 10%. It also expects EPS growth in the low twenties vs. previous guidance of high teens. Shares rose more than 6% in extended trading.LGI Homes (LGIH), one of the winners in the IBD 50, plunged 11% in heavy volume, closing near its 50-day moving average.

It also announced 2,971 homes closed for the first 11 months of 2015, a 41% increase.A rise in oil prices helped the energy sector perform better than most.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones utility average was among the few sector-based indexes to show a gain, up 0.8%.Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges compared with the previous session. Generally, low volume on a down day can be constructive.Defensive-type food and gold mining stocks were posting the best gains for the day among IBD's 197 industry groups. Retail stocks were taking the hardest hits.In the gold camp, Toronto-based Franco Nevada (FNV) added nearly 2%. The stock sports one of the better-looking charts in the gold group. Franco formed a series of cups in 2014-15 that essentially went nowhere. This year the stock advanced nicely from January to April, establishing a prior uptrend for the current base. The base is first stage; while the daily action has been choppy, the base's depth of 15% from high to low is on the mild side. The potential buy point is 71.58. The stock is trading below 71.On the fundamentals side, Franco Nevada is a turnaround story. Earnings declined in each of the past three years, yet Wall Street expects earnings to grow 32% this year on a 29% gain in revenue. The 29% growth in revenue would be Franco Nevada's best in five years. The stock has some quality institutional support: Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) upped its exposure by 98% in Q1.Franco Nevada is not a pure gold play. About one-sixth of royalty revenue is from oil and natural gas.How does Franco Nevada rate vs. its peers in the gold-mining camp?Retail stocks were hammered. However, there were a few places within the sector that didn't move much Thursday. A few names in the Retail-Specialty (including Ulta Beauty (ULTA)), Retail-Discount & Variety (think Five Below (FIVE)) and Retail-Restaurants (Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Tex-Mex dining chain Chuy's (CHUY)) industry groups are holding up well.

The S&P 500 ended Thursday's session about 2% below its 200-day moving average after meeting resistance near that line several times throughout the week.  It had also tried and failed to retake support at the psychologically important level several times in December before diving to a deeper correction.The Nasdaq picked up a distribution day Thursday,  but its 0.3% decline didn't indicate heavy institutional selling. Still, the higher-volume decline raised the index's overall count to three distribution days -- not a danger sign, but also not what you'd like to see in a young uptrend and a reminder that defensive trading represents a large share of the market's recent action.Oil stocks packed the top of the S&P 500 in early trade, as oil prices bobbed more than 2% higher. West Texas Intermediate traded just below $39 a barrel, up almost 8% for the week. Brent crude traded near $41, with a weekly gain of more than 9%.

"
517,ULTA,"It doesn't have an online shop. It doesn't promise luxury brands. And its fluorescent lighting and long, uninterrupted racks of merchandise aim in no way to replicate the glossy feel of a Bloomingdale's or Macy's.But Ross Stores (ROST) is widely considered a solid, if not particularly flashy, find as other retailers struggle against the Web tide, and as shoppers increasingly take their business to off-price channels.""They are so well positioned. They’re one of the best,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said of Ross, adding that the off-price industry overall has hit the ""sweet spot of pricing and distribution.""Ross is also a safe bet in this  increasingly hostile world for retailers, where online giants like Amazon (AMZN) are swallowing market share away from conventional brick-and-mortar stores by the plateful.The realities of the modern retail landscape reflect a consumer base that is increasingly drawn by Amazon's gravitational pull and the appeal of ordering things online. Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""

It added 1% after breaking out Tuesday.Another breakout came in more muddied circumstances. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) surged above an 89.48 buy point in triple its usual volume. However, the handle it cleared was lower than ideal. Breakouts past a low handle often lead to failure. Walgreens' EPS Rating is 81.

538,ULTA,"With a heavy load of distribution days on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, the market uptrend is under pressure. Here's a look at five IBD 50 stocks that are holding up in the wake of Monday's plunge and trading near highs: Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Fleetmatics (FLTX), Manhattan Associates (MANH), Ellie Mae (ELLI) and Illumina (ILMN). Ulta Beauty is…

539,ULTA,"Stocks climbed Tuesday to extend a weeklong rebound and remove some more gloom from the market. The Nasdaq led with a 0.7% advance. Biotechs were a source of strength on the composite index for a third straight day. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, aided largely by an energy sector that rallied despite an international agreement that eventually lets Iran put…

540,ULTA,"While retailers across a wide range of industries are struggling to compete with Amazon (AMZN), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has remained virtually blemish free. Now the question is, can Ulta's stock keep its glowing complexion in the face of the current market downtrend? In 2013, Amazon launched a luxury beauty portal that some feared would do to cosmetics stores what CEO…

541,ULTA,"There wasn't much good that can be said about Friday's rout. Leading stocks took a beating. The only bright spot was Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), which gained, although it found resistance at its 200-day moving average. Even there, it wasn't cheery news that lifted shares. An Indiana turkey farm confirmed a bird flu outbreak and said the USDA was going to…

542,ULTA,"Given Thursday's market sell-off, it's not too surprising that one more Sector Leader fell out of the list, leaving three stocks in Friday's IBD.

The latter two have been holding up much better than other leading stocks, many of which…

Figures for the prior two months were also revised higher.But the rally fizzled after Commerce Department figures showed that wholesale inventories unexpectedly fell in November, raising concerns about economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year.Retailers were among the hardest hit after a slew of analyst downgrades following disappointing holiday sales. Energy stocks rebounded.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) plunged 17% after announcing that it might miss its Q4 earnings estimate. Gap (GPS) dropped 14% after reporting that same-store sales fell 5% in the five weeks ended Jan. 2 vs. the same period a year earlier. Macy's (M), which announced store closures and job cuts earlier in the week due to weak 2015 sales, fell 3%.Paycom Software (PAYC) led most IBD 50 stocks lower, sinking more than 6%. The stock is nearly 30% off its 52-week high after falling below its 50-day and 200-day support lines.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a retailer of beauty and personal care products, has been a rare exception amid the market's sell-off. It held losses to 0.4% Friday and is still in buying range from a 175.88 buy point.

560,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty easily beat third-quarter forecasts and offered strong guidance late Thursday, while showing that it continues to aggressively grow its loyalty program.The specialty beauty retailer's Ultamate Rewards program had 17 million active members as of the end of Q3 (Oct. 31), marking a 17% year-over-year gain. Membership has been accelerating from previous quarters, up from 16.1 million members at the end of Q2, 15.5 million in Q1 and 15 million in Q4.Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink, who has an overweight rating on Ulta (ULTA), wrote on Nov. 22 that ""tapping into this base of loyalists could provide a stream of high-margin revenue at some point in the near future.""Shares jumped more than 6% in late trading, after closing the regular session down 0.2%.Ulta's Q3 earnings leapt 22% to $1.11 per share, well above consensus estimates for $1.05 a share. Revenue also rose 22% to $910.7 million, topping forecasts for $880 million and continuing a years-long trend of gains around 20% or more.Online sales surged 56.3% to $46.2 million. Same-store sales, which include online sales, grew 12.8% on 10.6% transaction growth and 2.2% average ticket growth. Retail comps rose 10.9%. Same-store sales were expected to be around the upper end of the guided 8%-10% range, wrote Wissink.The specialty beauty retailer, which carries both mass cosmetic brands like Revlon and Maybelline, as well as luxury brands such as Benefit Cosmetics and Urban Decay, also offers salon services. Salon sales rose 20% to $51.7 million in Q3.""As a result of our financial performance in the third quarter and our position of strength heading into the holiday season, we are raising our guidance and now expect our 2015 full-year earnings growth rate to be in the low 20s,"" said Ulta CEO Mary Dillon in a statement.Ulta's prior outlook was for high-teens percentage growth. The beauty chain also upped its fiscal 2015 sales growth guidance to the low-20s from the mid-to-high teens. Analysts expect 19% EPS growth on 18.5% sales growth for the year.Ulta also forecast 10%-11% comp growth for the year, up from previous guidance for a 8%-10% increase.For Q4, Ulta expects EPS of $1.48-$1.53 on sales of $1.212 billion-$1.233 billion, the midpoints of which are slightly above current Wall Street views for EPS of $1.50 on $1.218 billion in revenue.Ulta opened 45 new stores during the reporting period, bringing the retailer to a total of 860 stores by Q3's end.""With only 5% of the described 'beauty enthusiast' market, Ulta's new stores, brand building initiatives and growing loyalty program should continue to increase new members and frequency of existing customer visits, driving industry-leading comps and unit growth,"" wrote Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel on Oct. 7, following a meeting with Ulta senior management. He rates Ulta a buy.The company has a ""long runway of growth ahead,"" he said.

566,ULTA,"The market's solid showing this week should be taken with a grain of salt. It didn't do anything to change the fact that the uptrend remains under pressure. Tuesday's and Wednesday's strong gains were mostly because of a big rally in beaten-down oil and gas names.

"
569,ULTA,"One institutional-quality name that could be a beneficiary of window dressing is Facebook (FB).

572,ULTA,"The market sagged last week, with U.S. diversified stock funds losing 0.64% for the week ended Dec. 10. That was their second straight weekly setback. Investors were jittery over the widely expected rate rise this week by the Federal Reserve.They were also worried about stock market news concerning slumping oil prices, weak commodity prices and weakness among technology-sector shares.""The Fed and oil were the big problems,"" said Erik Ristuben, Russell Investments' chief investment strategist.History provided a potential silver lining to the dark cloud of the week's market blahs. ""The market often shows weakness before a rate rise,"" Ristuben said. ""But it often recovers right after the rise.""Oil's weakness stems from a price war. Saudi Arabia is determined to protect its market share, so it is pushing its OPEC partners into keeping production high. The Saudis expect low prices to drive North American producers out of business, Ristuben says.The good news is that outside the energy sector, the economy is in moderately good shape — fueled in part by low energy prices.""Eventually the market will see past the Fed rate increase and see that U.S. economic growth is likely to continue, even if modestly,"" he added. ""Earnings growth will drive stock prices. We expect mid-6%, single-digit returns for equities next year. Up, but not anything spectacular.""Mutual funds lost ground despite getting off to a good start with a strong U.S. job report, which many investors saw as sealing the deal on a rate hike.For the week, dedicated short bias funds did best among all categories of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds. They gained 1.98%.Among just market capitalization and style groups, large-cap growth funds did best. They rose 0.39%, one of only two categories to post a gain.Small-cap value funds did worst, losing 2.35%.Among stock funds with more than $100 million in assets and which don't do a lot of shorting, hedging or borrowing, $342 million Transamerica Growth Opportunities was the week's top performer, gaining 1.43%.As of its latest disclosure, it held Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which rose 3.4% in the week.The robotic surgical system maker has a good IBD Composite Rating of 95.The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Intuitive's earnings per share rose 1%, 23% and 34% the past three quarters.Lending Club (LC) rose 10.5% in the week.The provider of an online marketplace for borrowers and lenders has a 71 Comp Rating.EPS rose 100%, 200% and 300% the past three quarters.The $3.8 billion Morgan Stanley Institutional Mid Cap Growth gained 1.42% in the week.As of its latest disclosure, it held Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a cosmetics chain, which looked pretty as it rose 12% in the week.Ulta has a strong Comp Rating of 96.Also, Ulta is in the IBD 50, New America and 85-85 indexes.The $169.8 million Catalyst Dynamic Alpha rose 1.28%.It held NetEase (NTES) as of its latest disclosure.The Chinese provider of online gaming rose 4% in the week.The stock has a 99 Comp Rating.EPS rose 9%, 20%, 24% and 56% the past four quarters.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND), which has a 97 Comp Rating, rose 4% in the week.Commodity/precious metal funds led sectors in the week, gaining 1.44%.European region funds led world equity fund categories by losing the least in the week, 1.67%.Taxable bond funds overall were down an average of 0.35%.U.S. Treasury funds, up 0.99%, were the strongest taxable category.Tax-exempt funds gained 0.27% on average.Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter @IBD_PKatzeff.

""This includes the actions we have taken and continue to take to drive improved performance in the North American business.""The company said it regularly reviews its business and operations options and takes into account shareholder opinion. It did not confirm or deny talks with Cerberus.The statement comes after a Wall Street Journal report late Thursday that Avon was in advanced negotiations with Cerberus Capital Management over the acquisition of its North American business.That same day, an investor group led by Barington Capital publicly called for the restructuring of the company, and urged against a sale of Avon's North American business on the reported terms.""We would oppose any sale of the North America business on terms that are disadvantageous to current shareholders or limit the options for a new senior management team to maximize long-term shareholder value,"" said Barington.Avon is ""significantly undervalued,"" said the letter, which criticized Avon's board and senior execs for mismanaging the company. The group, which includes NuOrion Partners AG, owns more than 3% of outstanding Avon shares.According to Barington, the cosmetics seller's failures include its 2012 rejection of Coty's (COTY) $23.25-per-share takeover offer, ""inopportune"" share repurchases, and ""poor choice of new CEO,"" among other things.The group said its plan, which includes cutting costs and reinvesting in operational improvements, would save Avon $500 million to $700 million annually and achieve 90 cents in per-share earnings.Shares of Avon jumped 5.8% to 4.22 in the stock market today after rising as high as 4.52. The company has logged earnings and revenue declines in three of the last four reported quarters. Coty rallied 0.8%. Beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) surged 12.8% to a record high.

596,ULTA,"The Santa Claus rally fizzled out in the later part of December amid the oil rout and the Fed's long-awaited rate bump. The S&P 500 rose 6.8% for the fourth quarter, but edged down 1.6% in December. The Nasdaq gained 8.4% in the last quarter of the year, but fell 2% in the Christmas month.Stock mutual funds followed the same track in December and Q4.Managers of the nation's top funds the past three months have been gathering medical stocks, such as ICON (ICLR), Allergan (AGN), Centene (CNC), Akorn (AKRX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) in their latest reporting periods. Also on the top funds' buy list is China Biologic Products (CBPO), which was ranked No. 16 on IBD's Best of 2015 list in IBD's Personal Finance Action Plan 2016 year-end edition .Among the best-performing funds, gaming chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), lighting system provider Acuity Brands (AYI), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were a few standouts.Several financial REITs were strong performers, including Public Storage (PSA),Extra Space Storage (EXR) and Equity Lifestyles Properties (ELS).IBD noted 46 top-rated funds buying Constellation Brands (STZ), investing an estimated $169 million in their latest reporting periods.

597,ULTA,"The practice of shopping for high-end makeup has not yet gone the way of book-buying and succumbed to the weight of Amazon's (AMZN) can't-beat-'em discounts and free shipping — contrary to the hand-wringing over the 2013 launch of the e-tailer's luxury beauty portal.In fact, specialty beauty retail leaders Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora are doing just fine. More than fine, if anything.Ulta shares hit a new intraday high of 188.48 on Dec. 17, and Sephora continues to shine for luxury parent LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY).So what elusive ""It"" qualities does the specialty beauty industry have that make customers immune to the charms of Amazon?For one thing, it offers something that the pure-play e-commerce giant, by definition, can't offer: a satisfying in-store experience.""It's like a good glass of wine,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink. ""You can find yourself in your own space for a period of time. That 15 minutes is glorious.""Vanity FairWalking into a Sephora is a bit like wandering backstage at a Victoria's Secret runway show — it's all flattering vanity lighting and glossy makeup kits and the tacit promise of looking like Gisele Bundchen upon exit. Ulta comes equipped with full-service salons and Benefit Brow Bars in-store for those seeking the full makeover-montage experience.""Ulta and Sephora provide a place to play,"" said Wissink, adding that there's an ""intangible benefit"" of being in the store.A Beautiful EducationPlus, the ""test-and-trial"" nature of beauty products prompts first-time buyers to head to a brick-and-mortar shop instead of ordering online, she said.Testers and samples abound at beauty stores. Buying items like lipstick and eye shadow on the Internet is a tricky business — what appears to be one shade in one's browser can be very different from what appears in one's mailbox.There is, however, potential for Amazon to steal share when it comes to replenishing products.""In theory, (cosmetics) should be the perfect online business,"" Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""On the other hand, even repeat customers will walk into these stores and find new products all the time. There will always be an element of discovery with cosmetics.""YouTube and beauty bloggers offer a fairly well-rounded education online, for those willing to dedicate the time to it. But deciphering the latest makeup application techniques — think contouring or strobing — can be a little overwhelming.Ulta, which sells both mass brands like Revlon and L'Oreal, in addition to luxury brands like Urban Decay and Smashbox, offers makeup consultations at no charge. Sephora holds free makeup classes that conveniently allow shoppers some time to buy newfound products before the store officially opens for the day.No Seasons — Or DiscountsBeauty has the added buffer of not being a seasonal industry, say analysts, which keeps prices in check. Makeup colors keep changing, but the products generally remain the same. A facial cleanser knows no season. An acne cream is a year-round need.Contrast this to the season-dependent world of apparel, where fast-fashion retailers are pressuring traditional department stores and clothing boutiques.""There aren't four seasons; there are 52,"" said Siegel of the apparel space. When a product doesn't work, it goes on sale, and retailers have to hurry to push out inventory, creating what he calls a ""circular promotional death spiral.""Plus, prestige beauty brands have managed to keep pricing and distribution on a fairly short leash as they keep product availability exclusive to certain merchants.Still, there's nothing technically stopping Amazon from offering deals on Estee Lauder (EL) and other higher-end names.""My understanding is that luxury brands that are hesitant to partner with Amazon are concerned that this pricing consistency may be at risk,"" said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.But even brands that don't have an official presence on Amazon are often sold via third-party sellers on the site. And counterfeit beauty products are a documented problem on Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), eBay (EBAY) and elsewhere.""(Brands) are deluding themselves into thinking Amazon doesn't have a large impact on their business because they're not officially distributed"" on the platform, said Scott Galloway, founder of research firm L2 and a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.Amazon's luxury beauty portal has been a ""disappointment"" for the company so far, he said, but it ""shows no signs of giving up"" — outspending Sephora and Macy's (M) on beauty-related search-engine keywords on Alphabet 's (GOOGL) Google.And as the online retailer continues its assertive march toward retail domination, it holds a bargaining chip or two. Brands that choose to distribute via the platform can enlist its cooperation in erasing third-party listings, according to Galloway, who said once Burberry and Calvin Klein gave Amazon the go-ahead to sell a ""small number"" of their fragrance products, ""unofficial SKUs (stock-keeping units)dropped dramatically.""""The implicit message from Amazon is: Work with us, or we will (mess) with you,"" he said.No Specifics On RelationshipsAmazon would not provide specifics on its relationships with brands, but a spokeswoman told IBD that Amazon's luxury beauty segment is one its ""fastest-growing categories,"" and its online storefront offerings have resulted in ""more brands want(ing) to join Amazon's Luxury Beauty store.""For now, however, specialty beauty retailers are holding their own, especially as they build out their e-commerce reach.Ulta's online sales soared 56.3% in Q3 as it crushed estimates and boosted guidance. Sephora's e-commerce sales are ""rapidly increasing in all regions,"" according to LVMH's latest earnings report. Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote that ""Sephora is best-in-class with regard to their mobile/online execution."" Plus, it has been gaining share ""in all its markets,"" with same-store revenue growth ""particularly strong,"" said LVMH.And never discount the appeal of being part of an exclusive backstage club.Ulta's loyalty-program membership has been accelerating, quarter over quarter, reaching 17 million active members. By comparison, Starbucks' (SBUX) much-lauded rewards program has over 20 million members globally.Amenities ProvidedThe things that Amazon does so well — offering a wide variety and free shipping — are amenities Ulta and Sephora already provide. Members of both Ultamate Rewards and Beauty Insider (Sephora's loyalty program) have the added benefit of redeeming points for products.Over the summer, Sephora shoppers had the chance to redeem ""Epic Rewards,"" ranging from a foursome of full-size Givenchy lipsticks for 1,000 points to a trip to Paris to visit Lancome for 10,000 points. (Notably, the rewards promotion faced scrutiny for selling out items too quickly, prompting a social media backlash.)Perks like that have so far been enough to steer beauty buyers away from the less lavish space of an online megamart. Cowen analysts wrote Thursday that beauty is one area with an ""un-Amazon-able"" retail proposition, and that offering a differentiated shopping experience and/or selling a product with an ""emotional component"" offers a viable path to compete against Amazon.""Loyalty programs are extremely compelling,"" said NPD's Grant. ""It's like candy.""""(They) incentivize you to shop and to shop with them, and they do an excellent job of it,"" she said. ""Price isn't everything. But they also offer a good price and good service and all of the rest.""

693,ULTA,"Sephora and Ulta (ULTA) are stealing market share from CVS (CVS) and other drugstores as teens gravitate toward ""authentic indie"" brands, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey, out late Tuesday.Mass beauty brands are ceding share to indie brands and labels that get social media backing, said analysts. A quick peek on Facebook's (FB) Instagram yields about 885,000 results for #Revlon and fewer than 499,000 for #CoverGirl — both drugstore brands — but more than 2.5 million results for #UrbanDecay, a popular cosmetics label that can be purchased at both Ulta and Sephora.CoverGirl has steadily slipped down the rankings with upper-income female teens, falling to fourth place from second place, year over year, while Urban Decay's share has risen with all teen girls.Tied to that is the increased preference for specialty beauty retailers. Sephora nabbed a significant 38% chunk in Piper Jaffray's latest survey, climbing from 19% in the spring and up from 22% in fall 2014's poll among upper-income teenage girls. Sephora is owned by LVMH, which trades on the Paris exchange.While Target (TGT) took top honors in the spring, Ulta knocked it down to third place this fall, taking the No. 2 spot behind Sephora with 19% share of the vote, up from 13% last year. Target has 14% share.Drugstores that mostly carry mass beauty brands have also slipped down the rankings. CVS ceded about half its share, sliding to 6% at the No. 4 spot from 14% in the spring and 13% last fall. Wal-Mart (WMT) and Walgreens (WBA) have also slipped down the Top 10 list over the last 12 months.Ulta has a solid history of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96. Piper Jaffray carries an overweight rating on the stock.Ulta shares closed down 2.8% to 159.26 in the stock market today.

713,ULTA,"Learning to recognize and read the correct stock chart patterns (IBD calls them ""bases"") is, among other things, a process of assessing risk. Many stock bases come with one or more flaws. This means their length, depth or some other element falls short of the rules that IBD research has shown characterize the bases that preceded many of the stock market's biggest winners.
"
714,ULTA,"Among the most important and easiest elements to gauge is the position of the handle within a cup-with-handle base.
"
715,ULTA,"The rule says the midpoint price of the handle must be above the midpoint of the left-side decline of the overall base.
"
716,ULTA,"This simply means that the mathematical halfway point between the highest and lowest marks of the handle must be higher than the halfway point between the base's left-side high and its lowest price.
"
717,ULTA,"Consider the recent base built by CyberArk Software (CYBR). Using a daily chart, you can see the stock marked the left-side high of the pattern at 70.48 on Feb. 20.
"
718,ULTA,"The Israel-based security software developer hit a low of 47.51 on March 16. Add these two numbers together, divide by two and you get a midpoint of 58.99.
"
719,ULTA,"The handle started with a left-side high of 62.98 on April 8 and ended with a low of 56.87 on April 14. Add them and divide by two. This tells you the handle midpoint is 59.92, above the overall base's 58.99.
"
720,ULTA,"This shows the handle is in a healthy position. The stock formed its handle after spending enough time building the right side of the base as institutional demand for the stock grew.
"
721,ULTA,"You can stack the numbers like this:
"
722,ULTA,"70.48 | 62.98
"
723,ULTA,"47.51 | 56.87
"
724,ULTA,"58.99 | 59.92
"
725,ULTA,"Plot your buy point by adding a dime to the handle's left-side high. In this case, that's 62.98, so the buy point is 63.08.
"
726,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) recent yearlong base's left side high started at 132.72 in November 2013. It hit a low of 80.35 in January. The handle started with a 121.43 high in the week ended Sept. 26. It dipped 12% in four weeks, to a 106.87 low.
"
727,ULTA,"Adding the base's high and low and dividing by two gives you a midpoint of 106.53. Do the same for the handle and you get a midpoint of 114.15, plenty high enough to make the buy point valid at 121.53.

728,ULTA,"The number grid looks like this:

730,ULTA,"80.35 | 106.87
"
731,ULTA,"106.53 | 114.15
"
732,ULTA,"A handle or buy point that is slightly low can sometimes work. But the breakout will carry added risk of a breakdown.
"
733,ULTA,"In any case, you'd like your breakout to come with a big gain in strong volume.
"
734,ULTA,"Also, a correct midpoint for your handle does not assume the base's other characteristics are in order. The base's total decline, top to bottom, should generally be less than 35%. If it has a handle, the base itself should be at least seven weeks long from left-side high to breakout.
"
735,ULTA,"The handle itself should be no more than 8%-12% deep in a normal market uptrend, and you'd really like to see it drifting lower in dwindling trade.

Revenue jumped 47% to $49 million.Mostly small and midsize companies use Paycom's software to manage payroll and human resources activity.

"
933,ULTA,"The term ""fast casual"" conjures up a certain image in the restaurant industry — eateries that serve fresh food at affordable prices but without full table service.
"
934,ULTA,"Beyond that, there are vast differences.
"
935,ULTA,"At one end of the spectrum are ""burger in a bag"" restaurants, as Kevin Miles calls them. These places specialize in fresh-made burgers, hand-cut fries and soft drinks.
"
936,ULTA,"At the other end are restaurants that focus on wholesome fare that is free of additives and preservatives, and offer choices for customers on vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free diets.
"
937,ULTA,"That's the end occupied by Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), where Miles serves as CEO.
"
938,ULTA,"Zoe's specializes in healthy, freshly prepared Mediterranean food such as chicken pita sandwiches, hummus, kabobs, salads and tabouli. Although it occupies a place in the fast-casual universe, several things set Zoe's apart from the usual crowd.
"
939,ULTA,"For one thing, much of its competition comes from outside the traditional fast-casual sector.
"
940,ULTA,"Although Miles sees Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA) as his rivals, ""there are a few in the space that we don't see as direct competitors, such as burger or pizza restaurants. When our customers aren't eating at Zoe's, they are eating at Whole Foods (WFM) or at 'better-for-you' grocers.""
"
941,ULTA,"Another thing that sets Zoe's apart is the fact that it serves beer and wine. Most of the large fast casual chains don't. And unlike most chains, customers at Zoe's have food brought to their tables after they order at the cash register.
"
942,ULTA,"Upscale Appeal
"
943,ULTA,"Zoe's clientele also sets it apart. Women make up about 70% of customers, according to a recent note from analyst Stephen Anderson of Miller Tabak. Its core customer base is composed of college-educated women in the 25-to-54 age group who come from households with at least $100,000 in annual income.
"
944,ULTA,"""Women are our predominant consumer because most of the dining decisions are made by women,"" CEO Miles told IBD.
"
945,ULTA,"Because Zoe's gets most of its business from women, it tends to locate restaurants where the women are.
"
946,ULTA,"Analyst Anderson notes that the company ""seeks co-tenancy with retail chains catering to more affluent women with active lifestyles, such as Lululemon (LULU), Ulta (ULTA) and Ann Taylor (ANN) . Zoe's also seeks properties with high concentrations of offices nearby to sustain daytime traffic.""
"
947,ULTA,"Finally, the way Zoe's picks its markets is also different from the industry norm.
"
948,ULTA,"The company uses a ""hub and spoke"" strategy whereby it locates a major U.S. market — the hub — and then ""spokes out"" new locations from there. Most restaurant chains base their locations on local population density metrics.
"
949,ULTA,"Where Zoe's Goes
"
950,ULTA,"Miles points to the Dallas metro area as an example of its hub and spoke strategy. The company has 14 locations in the Dallas metro area and can probably expand to as many as 50 locations, he says.
"
951,ULTA,"""That's a huge concentration of locations, so from there we could spoke out to locations an hour or so from Dallas,"" Miles said. ""We could manage it from Dallas and be able to penetrate a lot of surrounding markets and bring a lot of efficiencies. We've done that in a lot of markets, including Atlanta, Charlotte (N.C.) and Jacksonville (Fla.).""
"
952,ULTA,"As of March 12, Zoe's had 140 restaurants in 15 states, including three franchises. Most are located in Southern states such as Texas, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia, though it will soon move into the Kansas City metro area, which will put it in both Kansas and Missouri.
"
953,ULTA,"The vast majority of its restaurants — about 90%, according to Anderson — are located in shopping centers rather than as stand-alone locations.
"
954,ULTA,"The company has delivered robust overall sales growth through the years thanks to an aggressive expansion plan. It opened 30 company-owned restaurants last year and acquired five franchise units.
"
955,ULTA,"Anderson looks for management ""to ease back to a high-teens to low-20% unit growth rate through the end of this decade, followed by 15% unit growth thereafter.""
"
956,ULTA,"Most of its near-term growth will take place in or near existing markets, Miles says.
"
957,ULTA,"Food And Finance
"
958,ULTA,"During its fourth quarter, Zoe's opened six company-owned restaurants and acquired three franchises. It logged overall Q4 sales of $40 million, up 40% from a year earlier and slightly above consensus views. Comparable-restaurant sales increased 7.8%.
"
959,ULTA,"The company posted a loss of 3 cents a share on an adjusted basis, better than the 5-cent shortfall that analysts had expected and vs. a 6-cent loss a year earlier.
"
960,ULTA,"For 2015, Zoe's expects revenue of $215 million to $220 million. The company guided 2015 comparable-restaurant sales growth to a range of between 4% and 6%, down from 2014's 6.7% gain.
"
961,ULTA,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year EPS of 6 cents in 2015 and 16 cents in 2016.
"
962,ULTA,"Like many restaurant chains, Zoe's got hit last year by rising costs of chicken and other food items, Miles says. He expects the company's cost of goods to decline ""ever so slightly"" this year as it gets bigger and as the company gains more buying power.
"
963,ULTA,"""A few years ago, we were too small to have much purchasing power, but that's not the case anymore,"" Miles said. ""We will continue to leverage our size with manufacturers and distributors"" to lower food costs.
"
964,ULTA,"Progress Since IPO
"
965,ULTA,"The restaurant chain had its initial public offering last April, priced at 15 a share. Zoe's stock rose as high as 38.42 on Oct. 31 and currently trades near 33.
"
966,ULTA,"The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 82. It belongs to IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranks No. 9 out of 197 industries tracked.

"
990,ULTA,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
991,ULTA,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

The pop came after an 8.5% surge in after-hours trading Thursday following the fourth-quarter report.An IBD 50 stock, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty and salon products at a variety of prices.In a report out Friday morning, Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow called the fourth-quarter ""one of the company's strongest all-around quarters in recent years.""Why is Ulta poised to keep shining? 1. A strong growth record is seen continuing.Part of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, Ulta ranks No. 1 in the group with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, based on a variety of metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.Ulta has logged 17 straight quarters of double-digits earnings growth. And analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see it turning out double-digit earnings growth for all of fiscal 2015. 2. The company's strategy is striking a chord with consumers.Ulta has stayed on top of its game by regularly rolling out new products and brands while enhancing its service and shopping experience. It also boasts an attractive customer loyalty program that keeps drawing new members.""The company's various strategic initiatives are all clicking (marketing, in-store experience/services, brand additions, e-commerce), resulting in elevated brand awareness and an acceleration in traffic,"" wrote Boruchow, who rates Ulta a buy.Ulta remains one of the best growth stories in retail, he says. 3. Ulta's customer loyalty program keeps growing.The company continues to benefit from management's strategies to drive brand awareness, noted Boruchow.He says those initiatives include the company's customer loyalty program, which continues to grow, boasting 15 million members. Boruchow notes Ulta's ""strong CRM (customer relationship management) platform results in a more targeted marketing program (less reliance on broad discounts)."" 4. Ulta is focused on improving customer service.""While new customer acquisition is a key initiative, management recognizes the need to drive repeat visitation via an improved store experience,"" he noted.Ulta is investing in more ""customer-facing"" labor hours, he adds, as well as in in-store technology to aid associates in their customer service function. 5. Supply chain initiatives are expected to prove beneficial.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen also came out with a bullish report on Ulta Friday following the company's fourth-quarter results. He has an outperform rating on Ulta.He noted that supply chain enhancements should ""benefit"" several areas of Ulta's business.""We are comforted by ULTA's goals to build a supply chain that will be able to support their growth plans (1,200+ stores) and believe sustained efficiencies will be able to be realized as they are able to continue gaining scale,"" he noted.The benefits from an enhanced supply chain include ""increased delivery frequencies to improve in-stock conditions; delivering cartons packaged in easier 'stock-to-shelf' manners; and leveraging inventory across store footprint to fulfill omnichannel orders,"" he said. 6. E-commerce is a bright spot for Ulta.In assessing Q4 results, Chen noted: ""Momentum at Ulta.com has been driven by higher instances of click-and-conversion rates on promotional e-mails, and consequently drove sales productivity higher. Our enthusiasm for the continued success in the e-commerce (division) is underscored by growth in incremental transactions (more than doubling) from customers who are actively buying online and in-store vs. solely in-store, leading us to believe there isn't much cannibalization going on between online/bricks and the customer.""Ulta is the second-largest company by market cap in the specialty retail industry group, after Luxottica Group (LUX), and before Petsmart (PETM), Michaels Cos. (MIK) and Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH).

The social network giant will report Q2 earnings July 29. The company is expected to earn 47 cents a share, up 12% from a year ago. But that would mark a slowdown from recent quarters.

1380,ULTA,"Tech stocks led, lifting the Nasdaq 0.1%. The S&P 500 lagged, slipping 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average faded 0.3%. Volume was soft, down 4% on the Nasdaq and 8% lower on the NYSE compared with action at the same time Wednesday.

1381,ULTA,"The stock market today faced some early pressure from a rising dollar, weak commodity action and sagging trade in European markets following the European Central Bank's decision not to alter its stimulus efforts.

1389,ULTA,"Sector Leaders is IBD's toughest screen, singling out companies with the best fundamentals with the most technically sound stocks.

Most have dropped below their 10-week lines, often an intermediate support area for a stock. Investors should watch closely for…
"
1390,ULTA,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
1391,ULTA,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
1392,ULTA,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1393,ULTA,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
1394,ULTA,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
1395,ULTA,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
1396,ULTA,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
1397,ULTA,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
1398,ULTA,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
1399,ULTA,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
1400,ULTA,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
1401,ULTA,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
1402,ULTA,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
1403,ULTA,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
1404,ULTA,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
1405,ULTA,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
1406,ULTA,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
1407,ULTA,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
1408,ULTA,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
1409,ULTA,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
1410,ULTA,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
1411,ULTA,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
1412,ULTA,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
1413,ULTA,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
1414,ULTA,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
1415,ULTA,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
1416,ULTA,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
1417,ULTA,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
1418,ULTA,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
1419,ULTA,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
1420,ULTA,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
1421,ULTA,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
1422,ULTA,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
1423,ULTA,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
1424,ULTA,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
1425,ULTA,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
1426,ULTA,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
1427,ULTA,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
1428,ULTA,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
1429,ULTA,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
1430,ULTA,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
1431,ULTA,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
1432,ULTA,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
1433,ULTA,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
1434,ULTA,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
1435,ULTA,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
1436,ULTA,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
1437,ULTA,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
1438,ULTA,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
1439,ULTA,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
1440,ULTA,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
1441,ULTA,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
1442,ULTA,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
1443,ULTA,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
1444,ULTA,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
1445,ULTA,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
1446,ULTA,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
1447,ULTA,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
1448,ULTA,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
1449,ULTA,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
1450,ULTA,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
1451,ULTA,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
1452,ULTA,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
1453,ULTA,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
1454,ULTA,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
1455,ULTA,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
1456,ULTA,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500.

That's another justification for owning Apple.IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.

1457,ULTA,"Amid a broader market selloff, it can be tough to know which stocks to let go of and which to accumulate.The IBD 50 features a number of consumer stocks with solid fundamentals that are holding up well and still poised to rise along with the steadily improving job market.Under Armour (UA) continues to impress, with analysts noting the activewear seller's good momentum despite the fact that many other retailers are struggling.Deutsche Bank recently reiterated its buy rating and raised Q3 earnings estimates to 41 cents from 38 cents a share on the strength of the athletic apparel and footwear sector. The Wall Street consensus is for the company to report a 18% earnings rise to 40 cents a share in Q3.The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, which means it has outperformed 98% of other publicly traded companies in areas such as earnings and relative strength ratings. In the IBD Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing group, Under Armour ranks third.In the same vein, Foot Locker (FL), a national retailer that carries Under Armour and Nike (NKE) merchandise, rode the back-to-school shopping wave with solid September same-store sales. A 16% Q3 earnings rise is expected from the company.The popular retailer has over 3,500 stores across 30 countries, and boasts a 98 Composite Rating. Basketball shoes remain a hot commodity, particularly among kids, going into the ever-precious holiday retail season, which should benefit both Under Armour and Foot Locker alike.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a beauty-product shopping destination that offers both luxury and mass-retail brands, has over 700 nationwide locations that also include full-service salons.The company ranks first in the IBD Retail-Specialty group and perked up in mid-September following an upbeat quarterly report that forecasted more than 20% annual earnings growth for the next five years.Ulta's fiscal Q2 earnings are expected to rise 18% when it reports. The company also plans to add 100 more locations a year to its roster.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) might stand to gain from recent consumer trends, as the Stifel Retail READ Survey found that slightly fewer people wanted to buy new cars, with purchase intent falling to a 1% year-over-year decline in early September vs. a 6% gain in late August.Plus, 44% of survey respondents said they own a car that is at least seven years old, and older cars generally translate to more repairs.The company earns a No. 1 spot in the Retail-Wholesale Auto Parts industry group and is expected to report a 32% profit gain in Q3.Lithia Motors (LAD) has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 and ranks first in the Retail-Wholesale Automobiles group. The company's earnings are seen gaining 22% in Q3.Shares of the dealership group perked up considerably at the beginning of the month on Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett's remark following the buyout of Van Tuyl that he expects to buy ""a lot more"" car dealerships in the future.

But you should be ready to do just that if the opportunity presents itself.Investing is not as easy as hitting the buy button on a stock that's breaking out from a base and simply waiting to ring the cash register. Not every trade is going to be a winner. Sometimes, it may take several buys before a stock finally gets going.Even if you've studied the market, analyzed the stock's industry, and read everything about the company and then bought the stock as it came out of a picture-perfect cup with handle in big volume, there's still no guarantee that the trade will be profitable.Investing is an uncertain game.If a stock just dinged you for an 8% loss, chances are that you may get a little gun shy. But don't just give up and move on to another stock just yet. This is especially true if there are no major changes in its fundamentals.Continue to pay attention to price-and-volume action, especially if you still have conviction in the stock. Don't allow your emotions to hold you back.If the same stock goes through its buy point or sets up again and breaks out in solid volume, investors should take a second stab at it — especially if the market is in a confirmed uptrend.Investors may even try buying a larger position the second time around.

One blemish, its 47 Relative Strength Rating, could clear up after today's stock action.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sells all kinds of products to enhance one's looks, but its recent stock track record reveals sharp fissures. Still, the once-ugly chart is starting to look prettier.Shares of the Bolingbrook, Ill.-based chain gapped up 17% at the open after reporting second-quarter results late Thursday that blew away Wall Street views.In its first quarter under CEO Mary Dillon, who took the helm July 1, Ulta earned 70 cents a share, up 30% from last year and 3 cents above views. Sales grew 25% to $601 mil, also beating.Its third-quarter outlook, though, fell below analysts forecasts. The market seemed to ignore that, as Ulta was 18% higher at 117.92 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today.But that's not a new trend for the beauty store operator. The stock has a history of gapping up or down when it reports quarterly results, then consolidating for a few months.Shares leapt 15% June 12, the day after Ulta topped Q1 profit and sales forecasts. It also guided lower for Q3.The prior quarter, the stock sank an unsightly 16% March 13 despite Ulta's better-than-expected results for Q4 2012. Its ultra-weak Q1 outlook apparently spooked investors.Shares tanked 12% Feb. 14 on news of CEO Chuck Rubin's resignation, which prompted analysts to downgrade Ulta.An 8% pop Nov. 30 followed its Q3 2012 earnings beat, and a 7% jump Sept. 7 after its Q2 topped views.Following a big multiyear run-up, the stock traded sideways from April 2012 to February 2013, with several failed breakout attempts.Since then it's been consolidating again, and could be ripe for a makeover.The former highflier's fundamentals remain attractive, with 17 straight quarters of double-digit earnings and sales growth.

"
1648,ULTA,"While the cup with handle is the most common stock chart pattern among great winners, the double bottom also pops up frequently — and has a similar look.It initially resembles a cup with handle, but then the handle slants way, way down. So far down that it no longer is a proper handle, and the overall structure instead takes on a W-like shape.The second part of the W actually undercuts the first. Look at the double-bottom base that Ulta Beauty (ULTA) formed in 2010 1, as shown in the chart accompanying this column.In early August 2010 2, it might have appeared as though Ulta was en route to etching a cup with handle. But the specialty retailer of cosmetics, beauty products and hair salon services made another move down, touching a fresh six-month low at 20.67 on Sept. 1, 2010.So when do double bottoms generally occur?As with any base, they often begin to take shape when the general market itself experiences an intermediate correction.You frequently get the second half of the pattern for a leading stock when the market tries to rally, then falls back into correction mode.That's exactly what happened with Ulta. The market was in an uptrend from early July through early August, as noted at that time in IBD's The Big Picture column and Market Pulse graphic.But the uptrend came under pressure in mid-August, and then the market fell into a brief correction in late August. Ulta etched the second half of its double-bottom structure during this period.The next confirmed uptrend began with a follow-through day on Sept. 1, 2010. This turned into a strong uptrend that helped unleash plenty of big advances by highly rated stocks, including Ulta.Ulta broke out on Sept. 3, a couple of sessions after the follow-through day. It cleared a buy point at 25.99. With any double bottom, the entry comes from the middle peak in the W-like pattern.For Ulta, the middle peak was at 25.89, so you just add a dime to get the buy point at 25.99.The breakout on Sept. 3 drew strong turnover 3 , just like you want to see. On a weekly basis, turnover was the strongest it had ever been for Ulta, which went public in 2007.
"
1649,ULTA,"""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,"" were the famous words of the Wizard of Oz, the unremarkable-looking character in the film of the same name, who quietly orchestrated all the comings and goings in the Emerald City.Institutional investors are the stock market's rough equivalent: They're quietly gathering large quantities of their targeted stocks, determining chart patterns and tightening floats until the imbalance of supply and demand squeezes a stock into a breakout and, if all goes well, a winning run.IBD provides two specific tools to help glimpse behind the curtain and gauge institutional activity. These are most useful when a stock is basing and near a buy point.The up/down volume ratio helps gauge whether or not a stock is under accumulation, a state in which the supply of shares is contracting due to rising demand. This indicates large institutions are at work buying the stock. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is another tool to help gauge such supply and demand.The up/down gauge covers 50 days of action. It's calculated by dividing total volume on days a stock's price ended higher by the total volume on days when it closed lower. The ratio should generally be above 1.0 in a stock that is about to break out.You can see the up/down volume ratio at IBD Stock Checkup on investors.com and on Leaderboard.Use the Accumulation/Distribution Rating as a corroborating indicator. You'd like to see a grade of C+ or better in a stock approaching a buy point. An A or B? Even better.Both indicators were on target when Ulta Beauty (ULTA) started its 525% advance in September 2009.The stock had built a flattish cup-with-handle base. Tight weekly closes and closes high in the range through the second half of the base suggested accumulation. 1 So did the skyscrapers of buying volume across the bottom of the base. 2In the week just prior to Ulta's breakout, its EPS and RS Ratings were both an 86 — not stellar, but still solid. But its Accumulation/Distribution Grade was an A.Its up/down volume ratio showed a potent 1.9 and had climbed above 2.0 in five of the eight previous weeks.Ulta broke out Sept. 4 in huge volume. 3 Investors who missed that day's gap-up eruption would have needed to wait two months for another buy opportunity, until the stock pulled back to test support at its 10-week moving average. 4

Ulta had topped profit estimates by 10% or more in each of the prior 11 quarters, including by 19% in Q2.Sales at stores open at least 14 months grew 9.6% vs. a year earlier.The salon and cosmetics retailer expects fourth-quarter EPS of 62-64 cents vs. views of 61 cents. Ulta sees revenue of $552 million-$562 million, with the $567 million midpoint slightly below analyst forecasts of $558.7 million.Ulta's shares fell 4% in early after-hours trading after sinking 1.6% in the regular session.(Original earnings preview follows).***Ulta Beauty (ULTA), the salon chain and cosmetics retailer reports after the close today, with investors looking to see whether consumers are still spending pretty on beauty products.Analysts think they are.Consensus estimates call for 38 cents per share in the third quarter, vs. Ulta's earlier guidance of 36-38 cents. They expect a 20% surge in sales to $406.1 million, near the high end of the retailer's earlier guidance for $400 million-$407 million.Analysts say spending on beauty products seem to have held up, despite the week economy. Ulta has been adding stores and stocking shelves with new popular brands and products. It now has about 415, each with a full-service salon inside.""We believe ULTA will continue to outperform and gain market share in an attractive category (positive demographics, secular trends), supported by substantial newness (new products and brands) and enhanced marketing,"" Robert Baird analyst Erika Maschmeyer wrote in an earnings preview note.But some worry about slowing growth against strong comparable months and a sluggish economy.Sales at stores open more than a year climbed 11.2% over the first two quarters of fiscal 2011, but the company has guided a slower back-half. Analysts are forecasting a still-strong 9.5% Q3 same-store pop.""With strong returns from the loyalty card and merchandising efforts, the business is humming along and we believe that trends will remain strong in 3Q and into the holiday season,"" Jason Gere, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a research note.Ulta is on this week's IBD 50 list of the best stocks based on fundamentals and technicals. Another IBD 50 company, yoga retailer Lululemon Athletica (LULU), reported third-quarter profit before the open that beat Wall Street forecasts.

1830,ULTA,"Ulta has carved a niche in the specialty retail space as a one-stop shop for hair salon services and beauty and salon products at a variety of prices. It features more than 20,000 products, ranging from high-priced so-called prestige brands sold in department and specialty stores to lower-priced labels sold via the mass channel, including drugstores and discounters. It also offers a full-service hair salon in its stores.
"
1831,ULTA,"""The key to Ulta's success is providing customers with convenience as a one-stop shop for beauty across all price segments and categories as well as an exciting shopping environment with a continual flow of new products and brands,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Wu. ""Most recently we've seen a solid comp acceleration driven primarily by a higher ticket as the prestige skin care and color cosmetics continue to outperform all other categories.""
"
1832,ULTA,"Ulta has seen a nice run-up in its stock, which has traded at several fresh highs since the earnings report. Wu attributes the stock lift to the fact that Ulta saw an improving comp trend in the second quarter.
"
1833,ULTA,"""It also saw a better-than-expected operating margin improvement,"" he added. ""And the company continues to take significant market share in the U.S. beauty market from department stores, which continue to lose share.""
"
1834,ULTA,"Ulta's expansion of prestige brand boutiques for major flagship lines such as Clinique and Lancome, says Wu, has ""strongly resonated"" with customers and helped drive a higher ticket during the quarter.
"
1835,ULTA,"Ulta added 39 Clinique boutiques in the second quarter; so it now has 90 stores featuring this Estee Lauder (EL)-owned brand. It expects to add 10 more Clinique boutiques during 2013. Five Lancome boutiques were added, bringing the total stores offering Lancome products to 85, with 20 additional Lancome boutiques underway.
"
1836,ULTA,"Wu says the prestige segment continues to outperform all other segments in the beauty industry, a lot of which has been driven by strong innovation and solid demand, particularly in skin care.
"
1837,ULTA,"From September 2012 to August 2013, the prestige beauty market grew 6% from a year earlier to $10.7 billion in sales, tallies Karen Grant, vice president and global industry analyst at the NPD Group.

1838,ULTA,"Skin care sales grew 8% over that time, and makeup sales 7%.
"
1839,ULTA,"Grant says while the growth in prestige beauty sales is still ""steady and positive,"" it's not quite as accelerated as it had been last year or the prior year, as the industry faces tough comparisons.
"
1840,ULTA,"Ulta has been cashing in on the segment's growth.
"
1841,ULTA,"""Part of what's going on with stores like Ulta is we continue to see the specialty-store channel as the top channel for the prestige shopper,"" Grant told IBD. ""One of the things consumers tell us is they love the format, which offers the freedom to choose from multiple brands. They also love the low pressure of the sales associates.""

"
1852,ULTA,"Ulta ended the second quarter with 609 stores in 46 states. It expects to have 675 stores by year-end. The company's long-term guidance is to grow its square footage by 15% to 20% a year.
"
1853,ULTA,"Chen says that long-term goal translates to ""extremely attractive"" square footage growth. He says the sector average in the companies he follows is between 3% and 5%.
"
1854,ULTA,"Wu expects Ulta's sales to rise at around a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years as it benefits from mid-single-digit comp growth and ""robust"" store expansion. He says it has the ability to double its store base to about 1,200 locations over time.

1857,ULTA,"Major averages ended the week on a down note Friday but that wasn't the case for many Sector Leaders. More than half the names in the screen rose, bucking the market's trend. (See charts on Page B9.)Ulta Beauty (ULTA) outperformed, rising 1.79 to 119.11 in soft turnover. The stock completed a three-weeks-tight pattern.Ulta has been stubborn about giving back gains after its bullish earnings-driven move during the week ended Sept. 13. Tight weekly closes are good to see after a breakout because it's a sign of strength and support. After a shakeout earlier this year, Ulta recently reset its base count. That means its latest breakout was from a first-stage structure.Elsewhere, Actavis' (ACT) breakout from a flat base in July took a while to get going, but the drugmaker extended gains for the second straight session in heavy volume. Shares hit an all-time high, rising 1.63 to 144.30. The company's $8.5 billion acquisition of Warner Chilcott is expected to close by the end of the year.Meanwhile, SS&C Technologies (SSNC) eased 5 cents to 38.50 in light trade. The mid-cap firm provides software that helps financial services firms automate and integrate front-office functions. A three-year earnings growth rate of 26% and sales growth of 30% point toward strong demand for the company's products.SS&C cleared a buy point of 38.90 on Sept. 17. Volume was strong but the stock closed barely above the entry. Shares gapped down on Sept. 19 after Carlyle Group sold its remaining 7.5 million-share stake in the company, but SS&C closed near its session high after early weakness. SS&C's breakout hasn't gained traction, yet its chart is still sound. The stock continues to hold above its 10-week moving average.

1903,ULTA,"Wealth-Making Patterns: Third In A SeriesBaseball star Ted Williams noted in ""The Science of Hitting"" that the top hitters ""work from a frame of reference, you learn what you might expect in certain instances.""Exceptional investors do the same. They learn what to expect in certain kinds of markets.Take a look at the chart above. It's a weekly chart of the Nasdaq in 2010 and 2011. Pay attention to the action through August 2010. It shows a jagged decline.What would you expect from such a market when a new uptrend is confirmed?If you said you'd expect this market to create a fair number of double-bottom bases, you'd be right. The jagged action in the Nasdaq shared the general shape of a double-bottom pattern (1).That doesn't mean that some stocks didn't form cups or flat bases during this period. But a smooth cup or tight flat base had some choppy head winds to fight to complete its shape well.The double-bottom base didn't have that problem. The market was helping the double bottom conform to its classic form.The double-bottom base involves a W shape, with the second low undercutting the first low and a middle peak in the upper half of the pattern. The buy point is the middle peak plus 10 cents, unless a handle is formed.After the spring and summer market of 2010 was through with its jagged ways, a follow-through day came on Sept. 1 (2).Savvy investors were looking at the uptrend with a ""frame of reference."" They expected double-bottoms. And they were ready to jump on them.Panera Bread (PNRA) cleared an 85.23 buy point in a double-bottom base in the week-ended Sept. 3, 2010 (3). The restaurant's shares advanced 25% in about three months.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) broke out of a double bottom the same week, jumping over a 25.99 buy point. The specialty retailer gained 43% in three months. Apple (AAPL) popped above a 266.09 buy point in a double bottom the week ended Sept. 17 (4).

1957,ULTA,"Options sellers take note! With CBOE's Volatility Index close to its five-year low, popular option-selling strategies such as covered calls and credit spreads have lower income potential and greater risk potential. Positions have to be monitored more closely, and stop-loss points might have to be tighter than when volatility levels are higher. Maybe it's time to try buying options! ""Tight stops,"" means that the point at which a stock position is closed (frequently at a loss) is closer to the current stock price. The risk of being stopped out, therefore, increases. But with volatility at low levels, the cost of buying call options as a stock substitute is greatly reduced. This article first discusses the cost of buying in-the-money calls as a stock substitute. Second, some examples using current Leaderboard stocks are reviewed. An in-the-money call is a call with a strike price that is below the current stock price. With a stock price of 55.00, for example, the 50 call is in the money by five points. CALL OPTIONS and THE EFFECTIVE STOCK PRICE A call option gives it owner the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price of the call until the expiration date. Stock investors, however, should think ahead to the full cost of the stock if a call is exercised. For example, with XYZ stock trading at $74, consider an XYZ January 70 Call that is trading at $5 per share. For a cost of $500 per share plus commissions, this call, gives its owner the right to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $70 per share at any time until the expiration date in January. If the call is exercised, then the former call owner becomes a stockholder. The full cost of the stock is the strike price of the call plus the cost of the call plus commissions. In this example, the full cost of the stock — or the effective price — is 70.00 + 5.00 = 75 plus commissions. The buyer of XYZ stock at 75 who follows the CANSLIM guideline of limiting losses to 8% would likely have a stop-loss at approximately 68.00 for a potential loss of 6.00 per share. But the call cost only 5.00 per share. In this case, if the stock price drops sharply, the maximum loss of owning the call is less than the loss of 6.00 if the stock were purchased at 74 and sold at 68. Also, it is possible for the stock price to dip to 68 or below, thus triggering the stop-loss, and then rebound higher. Whereas a stockholder could easily be stopped out with such price action, it is possible that the call owner could stay in the trade. So, the next time you are considering buying a stock, look at the option prices to see if the effective price of buying the stock with an in-the-money call offers you an attractive alternative. Leaderboard Examples On Tuesday, October 22, ARM Holdings (ARMH) was trading at 49.66, 8% of which is about 4. The ARMH January 49 call was offered at 3.60 per share. The buyer of this call has the right to buy ARMH at 49.00 until January expiration in 87 days. The maximum risk, if the call expires worthless at expiration, is 3.60, or 7.2% of 49.66. So the call owner could hold for 87 days and not lose more that the 8% CANSLIM loss-limiting guideline. On the upside, the call buyer is paying an effective price for the stock of 52.60 versus the current price of 49.66.  Also on Tuesday Oceaneering International (OII) was trading at 86.03. The OII January 80 call was offered at 8.10 per share, which translates into an effective purchase price for the stock of 88.10. The option also costs 1.20 more that the CANSLIM guideline of 6.90, or 8%.  A third example is Ulta Salon Cosmetics & Fragrances (ULTA), which closed at 126.11 on Tuesday, and the ULTA January 120 call was offered at 12.10. This is 2.00 more that the CANSLIM guideline of 10.10, or 8%. Should investors buy any of these calls instead of the stock? Is the higher breakeven point worth the lower absolute risk and the near-certain ability to stay in the trade for 87 days? There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer to these questions. Every investor must make a personal decision.

Sales climbed 22% to $413.1 million.Wall Street is expecting lighter results when the beauty chain reports fourth-quarter results Thu.Analyst consensus is for fourth-quarter earnings per share to rise 42% vs. the same quarter a year earlier, to 68 cents. That would be below the first three quarters of 2011, when EPS rose 61%, 52% and 68%, respectively.But Ulta Beauty's beaten the Street's forecast for profit and revenue growth the last four quarters in a row, so its fourth-quarter results could come in higher than estimates.Its stock price has risen about 80% from a low of 48.28 on Aug. 26 to above 87. From its recession bottom of 5.77 on Jan. 30, 2009, it's advanced 1,410%.Others in the beauty supplies group have benefited as well from rising consumer spending. Rival Sally Beauty (SBH), for example, has nearly doubled from a low of 14.88 on Aug. 19 to above 24. It's up about 800% from its recession low of 2.66.During third-quarter 2011, Ulta Beauty added 7 new stores, bringing its 2011 new-store total to 28, a 16% increase in square footage. The company is projecting bigger growth this year.""Based on the quality and strength of our new store pipeline we expect to accelerate our 2012 square footage expansion to the high end of our long-term 15%-to-20% growth range,"" Chief Executive Chuck Rubin said in a Dec. 1 statement.On Jan. 5, Ulta announced holiday results, with sales for the seven-week period from mid-November to the end of December growing 24.4% to $386 million.""We delivered an excellent holiday season,"" Rubin said then, ""with comparable store sales growth of 12.6% balanced across categories and brands, continuing our strong momentum from the first nine months of the year.""Based on that, the company raised its fourth-quarter outlook.Ulta Beauty now expects first-quarter EPS of 67-68 cents, in line with analysts estimates, up from its prior view of 62-64 cents.It looks for revenue in the range of $574 million to $579 million, up from its earlier range of $552 million to $562 million.

2210,ULTA,"Chuck Rubin had a tough act to follow when he took the helm of Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance from longtime CEO Lyn Kirby a year ago. But the message from Thursday's financial report was clear: so far, so good.
"
2211,ULTA,"Ulta (ULTA) blew out analysts' expectations with sales of $394.6 million, up 23% from a year ago, with profit climbing 73% to 38 cents a share. Especially, notable was same-store sales growth of 11.3%, which most analysts had expected to slow down after five quarters in double digits.
"
2212,ULTA,"The results showed the continued traction of Kirby's original concept of creating a chain of beauty ""superstores"" in off-mall locations, where women could get a haircut, try on makeup and peruse a wide selection of grooming products in one place.
"
2213,ULTA,"""We believe our consistent performance results from our compelling store experience; expansive and sought-after selection of brands, products and services; our knowledgeable and friendly associates; and our disciplined approach to managing our business,"" Rubin summarized in the conference call with analysts.
"
2214,ULTA,"In-Store Boutiques
"
2215,ULTA,"Rubin also confirmed that Ulta has been testing new in-store boutiques with Lancome, the venerable upscale cosmetics brand. William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin had published a note earlier this week saying he'd discovered this at one of the 28 stores now carrying Lancome. He tells IBD that the relationship is a significant step in Ulta's plan to get more ""prestige"" brands into its stores, which get their competitive edge partly by bringing together products at a variety of price points.
"
2216,ULTA,"""It's really the company's first iconic prestige brand presence,"" Hofkin said. ""If they got it more broadly across the store base — and I think they will over time — it would tend to increase the likelihood they would get additional brands. It's kind of a tipping point.""
"
2217,ULTA,"The company also announced a new partnership with magazine publisher Conde Nast.
"
2218,ULTA,"Ulta customers get a special $21 annual subscription to both Allure and Glamour magazines, while Ulta will use the magazines' editorial content on its website and in stores.
"
2219,ULTA,"""I think (the partnership) has a lot of places it can go,"" Rubin said on the conference call. ""Conde Nast has a subscriber base which is very attractive for us to work with them on.""
"
2220,ULTA,"The second quarter also saw the rollout of new in-store boutiques devoted to men's products in most of Ulta's 415 stores. The boutiques feature Procter & Gamble's (PG) Art of Shaving line, as well as razors, colognes and hair-care products.
"
2221,ULTA,"When Ulta announced the plan June 28, it said this was aimed mainly at women shopping for men, so it isn't expected to bring in hordes of new customers. But it's part of the company's continuous tweaking to make its format more user-friendly.
"
2222,ULTA,"""There's not necessarily a lot of new product, but it's all aggregated in the boutique,"" said analyst Hofkin. ""They had been scattered throughout the store based on the category. Now it's dedicated, and I think it looks very sharp.""
"
2223,ULTA,"Ulta opened 21 new stores in the quarter, reflecting a resumption of its usual pace after a recessionary slowdown last year. Rubin has said the company is shooting for 1,000 stores by the end of the decade, which means an annual square-footage increase of 15% to 20%. Its plan for this year is to open a total of 61 new stores.
"
2224,ULTA,"Ulta is still a relatively new presence in many of its markets, so the company is constantly coming up with marketing schemes to raise brand awareness. In May, the company threw a ""Love Your Hair"" event in its stores, which every week demonstrated products and techniques for a different hair type. Rubin noted that this proved more successful than earlier efforts that focused only on products.
"
2225,ULTA,"Next month, Ulta will throw a one-day Salon Cut-a-Thon to raise funds for breast-cancer research — and also, it hopes, attract new customers.
"
2226,ULTA,"The company also makes quite a bit of hay out of its customer-loyalty program, which now has a database of 8.5 million active members who receive various discounts and promos. Rubin says a new initiative this month will start sending customers ""refill reminders"" on frequently purchased products.
"
2227,ULTA,"E-Commerce Business
"
2228,ULTA,"Management is looking to ramp up its still-nascent e-commerce business, partly through a general IT upgrade. But the focus remains on the brick-and-mortar stores, which show no signs of slowing down.
"
2229,ULTA,"Jefferies analyst Randal Konik says the only competitive threat on the horizon seems to be revitalized department stores.
"
2230,ULTA,"""Macy's (M) has done a good job of upping the sophistication of its beauty counters,"" he said. ""That could pose a threat from a market-share standpoint. But it's too early to tell.""

"
2291,ULTA,"The market caught its breath last week, but this didn't stop some top-rated stocks from breaking out and gliding higher.When high-quality stocks move higher even when the major indexes are not, it's a positive divergence. Funds are deploying capital with an aim to increase their returns.This is encouraging during the twilight of summer, when trading volume tends to be light.Meanwhile, other members of the IBD 50 are building new bases after making strong rallies in the past. They include Web.com Group (WWWW), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Ancestry.com (ACOM). All three went public in 2005 or later.The pattern of breaking out, rising sharply, correcting and building a new base is a common cycle during a market uptrend.The latest breakouts are originating from solid growth sectors.Francesca's Holdings (FRAN), which broke out on Aug. 17 and finished the week up 11%, added just 1.1% last week. Yet the women's apparel and accessories chain also struck new highs and is now just slightly extended 6% past a 32.69 entry point.The 32.69 buy point is calculated by adding a dime to the highest price within a downward-slanting handle formed by the stock from July 18 through Aug. 2.The stock attempted a breakout on Aug. 7, briefly moving past 32.69, but faded lower in dull trade. Such action does not change the buy point.Cubist Pharmaceuticals (CBST), which ranked No. 49 in Wednesday's list, jumped past a 44.67 cup-with-handle buy point with a 5.6% weekly gain, the biggest among IBD 50 stocks last week.At 45.65, the stock is 2% above the proper entry. Investors should not chase a stock more than 5% beyond the proper buy point.Cubist's earnings shrank 4% in 2011, but have picked up 5%, 52% and 28% in the past three quarters. The specialist in anti-infective medicines has logged solid double-digit revenue growth for seven years in a row.Ulta, which has changed the way women shop for cosmetics and other beauty products, has certainly built a later-stage base. Such bases have a much higher rate of failure. But Ulta's gain since breaching its high of 35.63 first marked in late 2007 is not excessive.The three-year EPS growth rate is 71%. Analysts see Ulta growing fiscal 2013 profit 34% to $2.55 a share.
"
2292,ULTA,"Stocks extended losses after the Fed beige book noted slowing growth in four of 12 regions.The Nasdaq was down 0.9%, the NYSE composite and S&P 500 0.6%.

Endo has fallen back to levels from its late March breakout.Open Text (OTEX) lost 2% and breached its 50-day line in heavy volume. The line has provided support in recent months. Open Text is working on a possible base-on-base pattern.On the upside, Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance (ULTA) was off its session peak but still up 9% in active trading. Late Tuesday, the beauty supply retailer beat views with a 61% rise in Q1 earnings and a 21% gain in sales. It also guided Q2 results ahead of expectations. The stock gapped above its 50-day line at the open.Ultratech (UTEK) erased earlier losses and rose more than 1% in brisk trade. Despite recent volatility, the stock has managed to hold above its 10-week moving average. It's also had more signs of accumulation than distribution.

Another IBD 50 women-focused retailer, Ulta Beauty (ULTA), will report after the close. Analysts expect the chain of salon and beauty supply stores to report a 65% surge in EPS on a 20% bump in revenue. Ulta's growth has held up despite weaker consumer spending at salons, as customers continued to spend on cosmetics, hair care products and other personal items despite a sluggish economy.Separately, most major retailers, including Macy's (M), Target (TGT) and J.C. Penney (JCP), report November same-store sales figures Thursday morning. That will give investors a good idea of how holiday spending is going for specific chains and overall — and perhaps an idea of what to expect in December.

2412,ULTA,"The market caught its breath last week, but this didn't stop some top-rated stocks from breaking out and gliding higher.When high-quality stocks move higher even when the major indexes are not, it's a positive divergence. Funds are deploying capital with an aim to increase their returns.This is encouraging during the twilight of summer, when trading volume tends to be light.Meanwhile, other members of the IBD 50 are building new bases after making strong rallies in the past. They include Web.com Group (WWWW), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Ancestry.com (ACOM). All three went public in 2005 or later.The pattern of breaking out, rising sharply, correcting and building a new base is a common cycle during a market uptrend.The latest breakouts are originating from solid growth sectors.Francesca's Holdings (FRAN), which broke out on Aug. 17 and finished the week up 11%, added just 1.1% last week. Yet the women's apparel and accessories chain also struck new highs and is now just slightly extended 6% past a 32.69 entry point.The 32.69 buy point is calculated by adding a dime to the highest price within a downward-slanting handle formed by the stock from July 18 through Aug. 2.The stock attempted a breakout on Aug. 7, briefly moving past 32.69, but faded lower in dull trade. Such action does not change the buy point.Cubist Pharmaceuticals (CBST), which ranked No. 49 in Wednesday's list, jumped past a 44.67 cup-with-handle buy point with a 5.6% weekly gain, the biggest among IBD 50 stocks last week.At 45.65, the stock is 2% above the proper entry. Investors should not chase a stock more than 5% beyond the proper buy point.Cubist's earnings shrank 4% in 2011, but have picked up 5%, 52% and 28% in the past three quarters. The specialist in anti-infective medicines has logged solid double-digit revenue growth for seven years in a row.Ulta, which has changed the way women shop for cosmetics and other beauty products, has certainly built a later-stage base. Such bases have a much higher rate of failure. But Ulta's gain since breaching its high of 35.63 first marked in late 2007 is not excessive.The three-year EPS growth rate is 71%. Analysts see Ulta growing fiscal 2013 profit 34% to $2.55 a share.

2614,ULTA,"Black Friday has come and gone, but holiday gift-buying is just getting started. Many consumer-related companies are on the current IBD 50 list of the very best stocks. Ulta Salon & Cosmetics (ULTA), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) are top-rated retailers. Ulta and Lululemon also report quarterly results on Thursday. MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) will benefit from all those credit- and debit-card transactions.A word of caution. The overall stock market is in a correction and has been dependent on European headlines for the past several weeks.2. Ulta Salon & CosmeticsUlta Salon combines beauty salons with a wide selection of hair care and other beauty products at a variety of price points.Earnings rose 73% in the latest quarter — well above forecasts and the best gain in four quarters. Sales advanced 23%, the best gain in three years.On Dec. 1, analysts expect Ulta to report another quarter of beautiful results: 65% EPS growth to 38 cents on a 20% sales rise to $406.1 million.Ulta Salon's shares have held up well in a rough 2011. They found support at the 200-day line in late August, then at the 50-day in early October and November. But with the major averages falling hard, Ulta has dropped back below the 50-day line. Ulta is a late-stage stock, which means a future breakout is at greater risk of failing.4. MasterCard21. VisaThe kings of plastic don't actually carry credit balances themselves. Instead, issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) carry the default risk. Instead, No. 1 Visa and No. 2 MasterCard benefit from fees on transactions, so the more purchases the better.In the latest quarter, MasterCard's earnings per share rose 43% — 17% above forecasts — the best increase in 11 quarters. Revenue growth accelerated for a fourth straight quarter to 27%, the best in more than three years.The larger but slower-growing Visa's enjoyed 20% profit growth on a 13% revenue rise in Q3.MasterCard shares fell nearly 4% last week, but with the major averages falling even worse, their Relative Strength line edged up to record highs. Shares are falling toward their 50-day average, but are still above that level.Visa shares only fell 2% last week, but did fall below their 50-day line.6. Lululemon AthleticaLululemon's athletic apparel remain a trendy gift-buying location for people who can't or won't spend $70 on yoga-inspired pants for themselves.Lululemon has had trouble keeping up with demand all year, which has curbed sales and boosted shipping costs, but made it easier for the Canadian-based retailer to charge full price.In its latest quarterly results, Lululemon said profit shot up 73% to 26 cents while sales gained 39% to $212.3 million. Analysts officially expect slower growth in Thursday's release: a 39% EPS rise to 25 cents on a 234% sales advance to $234.9 million. But Lululemon has consistently beaten EPS views by more than 10%.Lululemon shares have been trending lower since their July 20 peak, falling 6% last week and 18% so far in November. The stock, now below its 200-day moving average, may need to meditate before attempting another advance.15. Dollar TreeThe discounter sells everything for $1 or less. That consistent selling point is appealing to consumers in a tough economy. Beefing up frozen and refrigerated food products has boosted customer trips and purchases.Dollar Tree's Q3 earnings, released Nov. 17, rose 19% to 87 cents a share. It was the 11th straight quarter of double-digit profit growth. Sales rose 12% to $1.6 billion. Both beat profit forecasts.Dollar Tree shares fell below their 50-day line in mid-November. They are trying to move higher again — rising nearly 1% last week — but are meeting resistance at that key level.Dollar Tree is part of IBD's top-rated Retail-Discount & Variety group. Several other value-oriented stores are part of the IBD 50, including Ross Stores (ROST), Dollar General (DG), TJX Cos. (TJX)and Family Dollar (FDO).Check out IBD 50's top 5 cloud computing stocks as well.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter.

2622,ULTA,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.9% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ULTA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Ulta Beauty Beats on Q1 Earnings and SalesUlta Beauty began fiscal 2018 on a solid note with first-quarter results beating the estimates and improving year over year. With this, the company reverted to its more than three-year long positive earnings trend, after a miss in the preceding quarter. Also, it reported sales beat in 16 of the last 18 quarters. While management issued guidance for the second quarter, it raised earnings view for fiscal 2018.Q1 NumbersUlta Beauty posted adjusted earnings of $2.63 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48. Also, the bottom-line figure surged 37.7% year over year.

Results benefited from the company’s store expansion efforts, comps growth along with impressive e-commerce sales and salon operations.Net sales of this cosmetics retailer increased 17.4% year over year to $1,543.7 million. The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,526 million. We note that Ulta Beauty adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on Feb 4. Including the effect from adoption of this new revenue standard, the company’s top line grew by $14.1 million in the reported quarter.Comps (including stores and e-commerce) increased 8.1% compared with 14.3% in the prior-year quarter. This upside was backed by favorable traffic and ticket along with stupendous e-commerce improvement. While the company registered transaction growth of 5.1%, average ticket was up 3% in the fiscal first quarter.Retail business (comprising retail and salon) witnessed comps growth of 4.7%, which includes 3.2% improvement in salon comps.

Additionally, gross profit margin expanded 10 bps to 36.3% owing to the impact of new revenue recognition accounting and lower fixed store costs. This metric was somewhat offset by category and channel mix shifts along with investments in the salon services and supply chain activities. Including the impact from adoption of this new revenue standard, gross margin increased 50 bps.While operating income expanded 11.4% year over year to $209.8 million, operating margin contracted 70 bps to 13.6%. The decrease in operating margin can be attributed to a rise of 80 bps in SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales). Also, pre-opening expenses were up 29.5% to $5.2 million.Other FinancialsUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $231.9 million, short-term investments of $237.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $1,783.4 million.

With this, the company operated 1,107 stores at the end of the quarter while increasing its total square footage by 11.6% year over year.In fiscal 2018, the company plans to open 100 stores and remodel or relocate 15 outlets.GuidanceUlta Beauty remains impressed with a year-over-year improvement in the top and bottom line owing to continued market share gains and benefits from strategic initiatives. Management updated its guidance for second-quarter and fiscal 2018. For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipates net sales in the $1,475-$1,488 million band compared with 1,289.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Comps, including e-commerce sales, are predicted to grow 6-7% compared with an 11.7% rise in second-quarter fiscal 2017.Earnings per share for the impending quarter are envisioned in the range of $2.35-$2.40 compared with $1.83 in the comparable quarter, last fiscal. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings stands higher at $2.50 but is likely to witness a downward revision.For fiscal 2018, Ulta Beauty still expects total sales to grow in low teens’ percentage with comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 6-8%. Further, the company continues to anticipate e-commerce sales growth in the 40% range.

2624,ULTA,"Markets ended sharply lower on Thursday, negating previous day’s gains on renewed fears of a global trade war. Yesterday’s decline was broad-based as the Trump administration decided to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The decision of the U.S. government has fueled investors’ concern that retaliatory tariffs likely to be imposed on several U.S. exports. All three major indexes ended in the negative territory in the last trading day of May.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,415.84, declining 1% or 251.94 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also decreased 0.7% to close at 2,705.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,442.12, shading 0.3%. A total of 8.09 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.63 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.83-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.58- to -1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 3.3% to close at 15.43.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow lost 1% with 29 of the 30-stocks in the blue-chip index closed in the red while one traded in the green.The S&P 500 decreased 0.7% led by 1.6% decline of the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), 1.5% drop in Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and 1.1% decrease in Healthcare Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Notably, ten out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3% due to broad-based market decline.Global Trade War Fear ReignitesOn May 31, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that the U.S. government will impose 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum from the imports of Canada, Mexico and the European Union from June 1. Notably, President Donald Trump levied these tariffs on March 1.Canada and Mexico was so far exempt from these tariffs as the U.S. government was negotiating with these countries on North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The European Union was also left out as many of these countries are politically close allies of the United States.As a result of these trade conflicts, U.S. exports have become vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would impose a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminum on imports from the United States.Mexico said it would target several U.S. goods with tariffs including pork bellies, apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel. The European Union is also considering imposing tariffs on a broad range of U.S. imports.As fallout of yesterday’s tariff announcement, stock prices of The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, as these companies generate a large part of their revenues in these countries.

2625,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) began fiscal 2018 on a solid note with first-quarter results beating the estimates and improving year over year. With this, the company reverted to its more than three-year long positive earnings trend, after a miss in the preceding quarter. Also, it reported sales beat in 16 of the last 18 quarters. While management issued guidance for the second quarter, it raised earnings view for fiscal 2018.However, shares of the company lost nearly 5% in after-hours trading on May 31. Analysts pointed that weak comparable sales (comps) and earnings guidance for the fiscal second quarter have hurt investors’ sentiments. Also, decelerated comps growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018 on a year-over-year basis remains a concern.In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 27.3%, outperforming the industry’s 6.9% upside.Q1 NumbersUlta Beauty posted adjusted earnings of $2.63 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48. Also, the bottom-line figure surged 37.7% year over year. Including gains from income tax accounting for share-based compensation, earnings per share were $2.70 compared with $2.05 in the prior-year quarter. Results benefited from the company’s store expansion efforts, comps growth along with impressive e-commerce sales and salon operations.Net sales of this cosmetics retailer increased 17.4% year over year to $1,543.7 million. The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,526 million. We note that Ulta Beauty adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on Feb 4. Including the effect from adoption of this new revenue standard, the company’s top line grew by $14.1 million in the reported quarter.Comps (including stores and e-commerce) increased 8.1% compared with 14.3% in the prior-year quarter. This upside was backed by favorable traffic and ticket along with stupendous e-commerce improvement. While the company registered transaction growth of 5.1%, average ticket was up 3% in the fiscal first quarter.Retail business (comprising retail and salon) witnessed comps growth of 4.7%, which includes 3.2% improvement in salon comps. Sales for the salon business grew 10.1% to $75.7 million. Also, Ulta Beauty saw a 48% surge in e-commerce sales to $154.4 million, reflecting about 340 basis points (bps) of total comps growth in the quarter.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteGross profit rose 17.8% year over year to $560.7 million. Additionally, gross profit margin expanded 10 bps to 36.3% owing to the impact of new revenue recognition accounting and lower fixed store costs. This metric was somewhat offset by category and channel mix shifts along with investments in the salon services and supply chain activities. Including the impact from adoption of this new revenue standard, gross margin increased 50 bps.While operating income was up 11.4% year over year to $209.8 million, operating margin contracted 70 bps to 13.6%. The decrease in operating margin can be attributed to a rise of 80 bps in SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales). Also, pre-opening expenses increased 29.5% to $5.2 million.Other FinancialsUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $231.9 million, short-term investments of $237.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $1,783.4 million. Merchandise inventories totaled $1,136.8 million, marking an increase of 8.4% from the year-ago period. However, average inventory per store dipped 3%.Net cash provided by operating activities came in at roughly $277.3 million at the end of the first quarter.In the reported quarter, management bought back 618,551 shares for a total of $133.1 million.

With this, the company operated 1,107 stores at the end of the quarter while increasing its total square footage by 11.6% year over year.In fiscal 2018, the company plans to open 100 stores and remodel or relocate 15 outlets.GuidanceUlta Beauty remains impressed with a year-over-year improvement in the top and bottom line owing to continued market share gains and benefits from strategic initiatives. Management updated its guidance for second-quarter and fiscal 2018. For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipates net sales in the $1,475-$1,488 million band compared with 1,289.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Comps, including e-commerce sales, are predicted to grow 6-7% compared with an 11.7% rise in second-quarter fiscal 2017.Earnings per share for the impending quarter are envisioned in the range of $2.35-$2.40 compared with $1.83 in the comparable quarter, last fiscal. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings stands higher at $2.50 but is likely to witness a downward revision.For fiscal 2018, Ulta Beauty still expects total sales to grow in low teens’ percentage with comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 6-8%. Further, the company continues to anticipate e-commerce sales growth in the 40% range. However, operating margin is projected to decline in the band of 50-70 bps.Consequently, management envisions GAAP earnings per share to grow in the low 20% range versus the earlier guidance of roughly 20% range.

2627,ULTA,"Kirkland's, Inc (KIRK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 31, before the market opens. This retailer of home decor products has been benefiting from impressive top-line performance, buoyed by efforts to enhance merchandise assortments, develop e-commerce business and increase store counts. On the flip side, higher operating expenses combined with promotional costs have been a drag. With these aspects in mind, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Efforts to Drive Sales Bode WellKirkland’s sales have been improving year over year for nine straight quarters now, courtesy of its well-chalked endeavors. Notably, the company has been making several investments for improving merchandise assortments, rationalizing SKUs, undertaking repairs at various categories as well as enhancing pricing and mix to augment overall execution.Further, Kirkland's gains from a robust e-commerce business. Notably, the company redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution. Additionally, third-party drop shipping is providing customers a wider assortment of product offerings. These efforts have been yielding significant results, evident from the strong e-commerce momentum witnessed of late. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, e-commerce sales surged 30% year over year and represented about 10% of Kirkland’s top line. In the near term, the company is expected to continue expanding its third-party partnerships, improve ‘buy online pick up in store’ capability and refine fulfillment processes to boost the profits from the Ship to Home business.Kirkland's also undertakes frequent store openings to support top-line growth. In this respect, the company resorts to the strategy of opening stores at popular locations, while shuttering smaller underperforming stores.Going ahead, management is committed toward making several experiments to attract more customers — online and in stores. That said, Kirkland’s anticipates net sales in fiscal 2018 to advance 3-5%, owing to increased store count and contributions from e-commerce sales. Also, the guidance is based on comps growth of 1-2%. Well, such positive top-line view for the fiscal combined with the company’s constant efforts to bolster sales raises the possibility of the company to deliver solid performance in the impending quarter. Incidentally, analysts polled by Zacks project sales to rise almost 5.4% during first-quarter 2018 to reach $140.1 million.Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. Quote Unimpressive Bottom-Line PictureWhile the sales picture looks positive for Kirkland’s, we are somewhat cautious about its bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Higher promotional spending, stemming from consumers’ accelerated changes in shopping patterns has been weighing on Kirkland’s bottom line, as witnessed during the latter half of the fourth quarter. Apart from this, higher store occupancy costs and outbound freight costs have marred profits. These factors led to a surge of 60 basis points (bps) in operating costs during the fourth quarter, while operating margin contracted 190 bps.Needless to say, higher operating expenses are a considerable threat to Kirkland’s profitability. We note that the company has delivered negative bottom-line surprise in three out of the past four quarters. The bottom line has portrayed an unimpressive run in the past eight consecutive quarters. In fact, the company reported a loss in five of them. To top it, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 9 cents, remaining flat with the prior-year quarter’s loss figure. This estimate has been stable over the last 30 days.Wrapping it up, while Kirkland’s initiatives to improve sales are encouraging, it is yet to be seen if such growth plans can offset lingering challenges pertaining to rising operating expenses. That said, lets take a look at what the Zacks Model reveals about Kirkland’s upcoming quarterly release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Kirkland’s is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2628,ULTA,"Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 1. The company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in the trailing three quarters. Also, it posted an average earnings beat of 25% in the last four quarters.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 79 cents, which narrowed by a penny in the last 30 days. However, the loss estimate has widened from a loss of 72 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAbercrombie has been gaining from significant progress on initiatives, strategic capital investments, cost-saving efforts, loyalty and marketing programs. Also, the company is expanding its digital presence with growth of direct-to-consumer (DTC) and omni-channel capabilities. Notably, its investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment have significantly led to development of the DTC business, which delivered double-digit growth in both the United States and international markets in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.In addition, Abercrombie is aggressively expanding Hollister stores in new markets, thus enhancing the company’s overall performance. We note that Hollister brand is gaining traction from the positive customer response to product innovations, emerging categories and overall customer experience. The Hollister brand reflects persistent positive momentum from previous quarters, reaching the $2-billion mark in sales in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, comparable store sales (comps) for this brand improved 11% in the quarter.Apart from the afore-mentioned initiatives, the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs and store expansion. It has also shifted focus to closing the underperforming U.S. chain stores to drive top-line growth and boost profitability. Furthermore, Abercrombie expects to maintain its disciplined approach toward expense management for improving the top- and bottom-line performance. For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $698.3 million, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company QuoteThese initiatives have also aided Abercrombie to gain 43.8% in the past six months, faring much better that the industry’s increase of 2.9%.However, Abercrombie’s strained gross margins since last few quarters remain a concern in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Soft traffic at stores and a highly promotional environment have been weighing on the company’s margins. Its ongoing strategic initiatives to improve profitability are hurting margins as well. Notably, the company’s guidance suggests continued gross margin pressure in the fiscal first quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Abercrombie is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Abercrombie has an Earnings ESP of +1.54% and Zacks Rank #3, which makes us confident of positive earnings surprise.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ulta Beauty, Inc.

2629,ULTA,"The Chinese Year of the Dog kicked off on Feb 16, which has historically been promising for the U.S. stock market. Astute investors, thus, should turn bullish and use this encouraging calendar year to their advantage. And why not? The Republican tax overhaul is expected to have a positive effect on earnings this year. Fears of surging inflation and higher interest rates, on the other hand, are unwarranted and likely to ease.Year of the Dog is Great for the U.S. Stock MarketThe U.S. equity market traditionally performs well in the Year of the Dog, per LPL Research. Data from as early as 1950 showed that the 12-month return on the broader S&P 500 in the year was up more than 15% on average.In four of the last five Year of the Dog, the market clocked double-digit gains. In 1958, returns were the highest, up 32.9%. In the most recent one ending in 2006, the returns were also quite solid, increasing 12.4%. YearS&P 500 Return in the Year of the Dog195832.9%197012.7%198220.7%1994-2.3%200612.4%Average15.3%(Source: LPL)Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist at LPL added that “in fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return.” In the past Year of the Goat, Tiger, Ox, Rabbit, Pig, Monkey, Dragon, Horse, Rat, Rooster and Snake, the S&P 500 had given an average return of 14.9%, 13.8%, 13.5%, 10.6%, 10.5%, 9.2%, 8.7%, 6.3%, 3.2%, 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.Though a few may be skeptical about investing based on stars, but this Year of the Dog has certainly started off on a bullish note. The S&P 500 managed to log its sixth straight rise on Feb 16. After all, U.S. earnings expectations have sharply accelerated on tax stimulus, while inflation scares are overblown.Tax Plan to Boost EarningsThe Trump administration’s tax cut policy is expected to boost earnings, in a market that already has historically high valuations. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate is lowered from 35% to 21%. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Earnings growth this year is set to be healthy. Most of the S&P 500 companies have provided guidance that exceeded expectations, while the Q4 earnings season is already on track to be quite impressive. For the 398 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% from the same period last year on 9% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% surpassing revenue estimates.In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 14% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.8% higher revenues (read more: What Will Retail Earnings Show?).Inflation and Rate Hike Fears OverblownA surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster-than-expected rate hikes did trigger a sudden panic among investors. Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This, in turn, will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy.But, market pundits believe that the spike in inflation last month will fizz out. Even though the consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.5% in January from the previous month, it stayed at 2.1% in January on a year-over-year basis. Thus, it has fallen from the nearly 3% annual growth rate in the last three months. Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been below the central bank’s 2% target since mid-2012.  Wage growth in January also doesn’t hint at a surge in cost of living. After all, wages rose on colder-than-normal weather condition, which is a seasonal factor. Further, if managers and supervisors’ salaries are excluded, hourly wages increased at a sluggish pace. This showed that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness, investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Dog seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that are poised to yield stellar returns this calendar year that constitute bulk of the Year of the Dog.These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

2630,ULTA,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.1% over the past month. URBN hit a new 52-week high of $43.58 in the previous session. Urban Outfitters has gained 16.4% since the start of the year compared to the 7.8% move for the Retail-Wholesale sector and the -5.4% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 22, 2018, Urban Outfitters reported EPS of $0.38 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.3 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.22%.For the current fiscal year, Urban Outfitters is expected to post earnings of $2.38 per share on $3.88 billion in revenues. This represents a 42.51% change in EPS on a 7.36% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.62 per share on $3.95 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.2% and 1.72%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUrban Outfitters may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for URBN? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Urban Outfitters has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.1X versus its peer group's average of 9.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price and Consensus  Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price and Consensus | Urban Outfitters, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Urban Outfitters currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Urban Outfitters passes the test. Thus, it seems as though URBN shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Urban Outfitters Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Urban Outfitters have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Xcel Brands (XELB  -  Free Report), Buckle, (BKE  -  Free Report), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 34% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for URBN, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

(KIRK  -  Free Report) well-knit strategic endeavors to boost sales have been yielding positively, evident from consistent year-over-year improvement in top line for almost nine straight quarters. The company has been gaining from its efforts to enhance merchandise assortments, develop e-commerce business and constant store additions.Such robust initiatives combined with a positive sales view boosts investors’ optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares have gained 15.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 1.9%.In spite of such upsides, Kirkland's struggles with weak bottom-line performance, primarily stemming from higher operating costs.That said, let’s get a closer glimpse of these factors impacting the performance this retailer of home decor products.Initiatives to Drive Sales Bode Well Kirkland's effective merchandising efforts has been one of the factors boosting store sales. Additionally, rationalizing SKUs, undertaking repairs at various categories and enhancing pricing as well as mix to enhance overall execution also benefit performance. Notably, these factors combined with solid comps drove fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 net sales. Further, Kirkland's gains from a robust e-commerce business. Incidentally, the company redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution. ‘The special order program’ also enables customers to choose from various styles of seats and benches that are not offered usually in its stores.Additionally, the launch of third-party drop shipping in fiscal 2015 gave customers a wider assortment of product offerings. These efforts have been yielding significant results, evident from the strong e-commerce momentum witnessed of late. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, e-commerce sales surged 30% year over year and represented about 10% of Kirkland’s top line.This came on the back of constant focus on enhancing omni-channel business, online product range and fulfilment operations. In the near term, the company is expected to continue expanding its third-party partnerships, improve ‘buy online pick up in store’ capability and refine its fulfillment processes to increase the profitability of the Ship to Home business.Kirkland's also undertakes frequent store openings to support its top-line growth. In this respect, the company resorts to the strategy of opening stores at popular locations, while shuttering smaller underperforming stores. During fiscal 2017, Kirkland’s opened 31 stores while shutting 17. This included five store openings and two closures in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, management intends to open 20-25 new stores and close 10-15 stores.Going ahead, management is committed toward making several experiments to attract more customers — online and in stores. That said, Kirkland’s anticipates net sales in fiscal 2018 to advance 3-5%, owing to increased store count and contributions from e-commerce sales. Also, this guidance is based on comps growth of 1-2%.Higher Costs a Concern Higher promotional spending, stemming from consumers’ accelerated changes in shopping patterns has been weighing on Kirkland’s bottom line, as witnessed during the latter half of the fourth quarter. Apart from this, higher store occupancy costs and outbound freight costs have also been a drag on profitability.These factors led to a surge of 60 basis points (bps) in operating costs during the fourth quarter, while operating margin shrank 190 bps.  Persistence of higher operating expenses is a considerable threat to Kirkland’s profitability in the forthcoming periods. While Kirkland’s initiatives to improve sales are encouraging, it is yet to be seen if such growth plans can counter ongoing hurdles.Looking for More?

2632,ULTA,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) announced that it will break ground on the second phase of Dania Pointe on Jul 12. Encouragingly, this mixed-use development project in Southern Broward County, FL, has grabbed much attention and the initial 325,000 square feet of space is already 93% leased.Notably, the project on 102 acres of land is situated just next to I-95 and will serve as the central location for residents going north and south on I-95. Moreover, it is situated less than 10 minutes from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades.The strategic location of the project has likely enabled the company to rope well-known tenants like TJ Maxx, Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), Five Below (FIVE  -  Free Report), YouFit, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Verizon, among others in its first phase, that is scheduled to open in August.  The second phase of Dania Pointe will take place in multiple stages. Per management, strong demand for retail space in the first phase has encouraged the company to proceed with the second phase. The second phase will add 300,000 square feet of retail space that is already 50% pre-leased, as well as another 125,000-square-foot area which will be included later.Further, management announced that it will break ground on the first 300 apartments at Dania Pointe this summer. Also, the site has received approval for 500,000 square feet of office space. This could mark the first office space and will likely stir interest from Class A office tenants.Notably, healthy leasing activity for retail space in the development is in stark contrast to the lackluster retail environment prevailing in the United States. Importantly, the predominance of e-retailers over brick-and-mortar sales has emerged as a serious concern for retail REITs. In fact, a number of retail landlords have been affected due to online channels increasingly gaining popularity. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers.Hence, positive response for retail space in the development gives us confidence that the site will enjoy high occupancy. Moreover, open-air retail centers have performed better than enclosed malls.Although Kimco owns premium properties in high-growth areas, it is not completely immune to the wrath of rising online sales, store closures and tenant bankruptcy.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2633,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) has been climbing up the charts after it reported impressive results in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Results were driven by the company’s solid strategic efforts along with excellent marketing and store-growth initiatives, impressive e-commerce improvement and continued progress on salon operations. Also, it raised fiscal 2018 GAAP earnings view.As a result, the company’s shares were up nearly 2.5% since May 31, when it released the quarterly results. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 21.9%, outperforming the industry’s 10.2% upside.Additionally, analysts are growing bullish on the stock as apparent from the solid uptrend in earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.92 for fiscal 2018 and $12.76 for fiscal 2019 moved north 16 cents and 2 cents, respectively, in the last 30 days. Also, Ulta Beauty has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 18.6% and a VGM Score of A. Let’s delve deep.Solid Q1 Results & Surprise TrendUlta Beauty has an impressive surprise history on both earnings and revenue fronts. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company reverted to its more than three-year long positive earnings trend, after a miss in the preceding quarter. Also, it reported sales beat in 16 of the last 18 quarters. Both the top and bottom line also improved year over year. Results were fueled by enhanced market share gains, strength in loyalty program, solid e-commerce business and other growth initiatives. Additionally, favorable traffic drove comparable store sales (comps) growth in the quarter.Ulta Beauty is also known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. Notably, the company registered e-commerce sales growth of 48% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, which reflects about 340 basis points (bps) of the total comps growth. This upside was driven by traffic growth of 38% and mobile traffic surge of 52%. For fiscal 2018, management anticipates e-commerce sales to grow in the 40% range.Based on the above-mentioned tailwinds, management raised its GAAP earnings per share view. The metric is projected to grow in the low 20% range versus the earlier guidance of roughly 20% range.Growth InitiativesUlta Beauty’s loyalty program is significantly contributing to the company’s results, thus boosting the top line and profitability. In fact, it was one of the major sales drivers in first-quarter fiscal 2018. The company also increased its Ultamate Rewards membership by 17%, courtesy of its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors as well as in-store conversions. Meanwhile, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained solid in the quarter.Furthermore, the company remains committed to its store-expansion endeavors and enhancement of its supply chain capabilities apart from strengthening its e-commerce business. Evidently, it is on track to open 100 stores in fiscal 2018.Ulta Beauty has also created a niche market backed by the sold mix of beauty products it offers. Currently, the company’s stores are a one stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, featuring prestige and discount beauty brands, and offering salon products and services, all under one roof. Additionally, it remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings besides improving store traffic with superior services. Notably, Ulta Beauty rolled out The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand in fiscal 2017. We believe all these afore-mentioned initiatives to increase the company’s market share and boost profitability.Wrapping Up While all the above factors speak well about Ulta Beauty, we note that the company has been grappling with soft margins due to higher SG&A and pre-opening expenses. Although operating margin is expected to contract in the band of 50-70 bps in fiscal 2018, we believe Ulta Beauty’s robust strategies to offset margins decline going ahead.Want Top-Ranked Retail Stocks, Count on TheseBig 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report) pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 10.5% in the last four quarters.

2634,ULTA,"With U.S. economic growth being the sturdiest since recession, unemployment at an 18-year low and manufacturing activity at a decent clip despite the ongoing trade spat, it makes sense to ride out the amazing growth momentum. And that’s what investors did on Jun 4 — they pushed the Nasdaq to an all-time high. The NASDAQ 100 was at a record 7,143.5703 on Jun 4 while the NASDAQ Composite hit 7,606.46. While several corners of the market are presently offering opportunities, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is expected to be on fire as we progress into 2018. A global quantitative and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute indicated that there is “a lot of room to run.” Investors should note that in a growing economy, cyclical sectors like technology and consumer discretionary tend to do well. These sectors also perform well in a rising rate environment that we are witnessing currently in the United States. In any case, the tech space has suffered its share of pain this year in March thanks to issues like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) data debacle, short-selling pressure in Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and concerns over semiconductor sales. So, many of the industry biggies have been enjoying compelling valuation after the recent selloffs, which pushed the index higher. After all, rising enterprise spending, the tailwind of tax cuts and other emerging technologies have pushed investors toward these stocks.Inside Nasdaq-100The Nasdaq 100 gained more than 0.8% on its way to an all-time high on Jun 1. The index holds about 103 securities. Technology takes about 56.53% followed by Consumer Services (24.5%) and Health Care (9.36%). Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) takes the first spot in the index with about 11.34% exposure while Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) (9.36%), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) (9.34%) and Facebook (5.10%) round out the top four positions. With tech titans like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Electronic Arts EA and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) hitting new highs on Jun 4, these stocks definitely played a fair role in pushing the index higher. Still, below we highlight a few Nasdaq-100 stocks that were the top performers on the day.JD.com Inc. (JD  -  Free Report) – Up 5.74%JD.com, Inc. operates as an online direct sales company in China.

Online sales saw another record on Black Friday, while foot traffic on that day in stores didn’t fall as much as analysts had feared. If you went out shopping last Friday, you likely noticed that a ton of other people decided to join you. Or at least I did. My local Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), and Ulta (ULTA  -  Free Report) were packed, with winding lines during those peak doorbuster hours.This rise in retail activity has helped bolster retail stocks, even after not too shabby Q3 earnings results, and shares of Macy’s, JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report), Target, and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) all rallied yesterday after preliminary Black Friday sales results started to creep in.While solid promotions were likely a big driver for a lot of shoppers, the strong economy should also be looked at.

2637,ULTA,"Woman sharing space with men in the business world is no longer unusual. In fact, many companies with female employees in top spots are performing pretty well, if we go by a MSCI’s report released in 2015. MSCI ESG Research’s research revealed in 2015 that “companies in the MSCI World Index with strong female leadership generated a Return on Equity of 10.1% per year versus 7.4% for those without (as of September 9, 2015, measured on an equal-weighted basis).”To further validate women’s leadership in the business world, Stacey Cunningham, the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) chief operating officer, is set to become its 67th president. In the 226-year history of the exchange, Stacey Cunningham will become its first woman chief.This Friday, Cunningham will take over the reins from Tom Farley, who has served as the president of NYSE since 2014 and is reportedly leaving to join a firm backed by Third Point, the hedge fund founded by Daniel Loeb. John Tuttle, the head of listings at NYSE, will take the Cunningham’s place. Cunningham joined NYSE in 2012. As a point of reference, another big U.S. exchange Nasdaq named Adena Friedman as its chief executive officer in 2017, making her the first woman leader of a global exchange.Rise of Women Empowerment This is not the first time that NYSE is empowering a woman and testifying to its gender diversity. In April, there was an announcement that the statue of the Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new address by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. The sculpture is basically is an embodiment of gender equality and the power of women in leadership (read: NYSE to Soon Greet The Fearless Girl Statue).The Fortune 500 also noted that the percentage of female CEOs has increased since 1998, however with some dips after 2011. There are currently 24 women CEOs at companies that form the 2018 Fortune 500 list, down from last year's record-breaking 32. The reason behind the latest drop is resignation from a third of Fortune 500 female CEOs last year.Against this backdrop, we would like to highlight a few investing options that are focused on women leaders.Stock Picks Ulta Beauty Inc.

Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 15.6% on May 25.Moreover, Hibbett has declined 3.4% in the last three months, against the industry’s growth of 3.7%.Q1 HighlightsHibbett reported earnings of $1.12 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. However, earnings improved 15% from 97 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. The lag can be attributed to soft margins and higher SG&A expenses.Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. QuoteNet sales dipped 0.4% to $274.7 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $277 million. The decline is attributed to soft same-store sales (comps), offset by strong e-commerce growth. Comps fell 0.3% due to negative 7.3% comps in February, offset by comps growth of 6.1% and 0.6% in March and April, respectively.During the reported quarter, branded apparel remained extremely strong with high single-digit comps growth. Additionally, footwear and cleats reported positive comps. Notably, e-commerce sales accounted for nearly 7% of total sales in the fiscal first quarter.Hibbett’s gross profit declined 1.4% to nearly $96.8 million while gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 35.2%. The decline in margin was due to higher sales of clearance merchandise and freight related with e-commerce sales. Operating income of $28.6 million declined 16.4% from $34.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, operating margin contracted 200 bps to 10.4%, attributed to lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A expenses. The increase in SG&A expenses stemmed from additional operating expenses associated with reinvestment of tax reform savings to benefit the company’s team members, additional marketing expenses to drive e-commerce sales and investments for the launch of its new mobile app.Other Financial AspectsHibbett ended the fiscal first quarter with nearly $115.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, no bank debt outstanding and full availability under its $60-million revolving credit facility.

Consequently, it ended the quarter with 1,068 stores across 35 states.OutlookFollowing a soft fiscal first quarter, the company believes that it is well positioned for the fiscal second quarter, given its fresh assortments and easier comparisons as it prepares for the back-to-school season. Going into the fiscal second quarter, the company sees more opportunities with cleaner inventory levels and higher volumes of new product. Further, it expects to benefit from healthier branded apparel and footwear categories compared with the prior-year quarter.The company expects gross margin comparisons to be relatively easier as product margin is expected to improve significantly due to fresher product and significant leverage on store occupancy expenses due to the week shift caused by the 53rd week last year.For fiscal 2019, the company reiterated its previously-stated outlook, projecting earnings of $1.65-$1.95 per share compared with $1.71 earned in fiscal 2018.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp.

2646,ULTA,"Earnings growth interests all, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t be able to stand the test of time. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, deduct production cost and you will have earnings!This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks Rank Buy and Strong Buy are allowed.

Notably, this marked the company’s 14th and 4th straight quarter of earnings and sales beat, respectively.

On a currency-neutral basis earnings grew 23% on the back of robust sales, solid cost savings and progress with the Leading Beauty Forward initiatives.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc.

(The) Quote On including certain one-time items like restructuring costs associated with Leading Beauty Forward initiative and charges related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), earnings came in at 33 cents, down significantly from $1.15 reported in the year-ago period.Estee Lauder’s net sales of $3,744 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,673 million. Moreover, sales increased 17% from the prior-year quarter, driven by acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, which contributed about 2 percentage points of the reported sales growth. Further, sales advanced 14% on a constant currency basis, courtesy of exceptional growth in travel retail, Asia and the company’s global online sales. Further, several regions in Europe and most product categories delivered double-digit sales growth. Also, the brands delivered stellar e-commerce results in the holiday season, with customizable gift choices being major contributors.Gross profit increased 16% to $2,991 million but gross margin shrank 20 basis points (bps) to 78.3% as improved revenues were offset by higher cost of sales.Product Based Segment ResultsOn the basis of product category, Skin Care reported sales growth of 20% year over year (up 17% on a constant currency basis) to $1,494 million, owing to double-digit improvements in brands including GLAMGLOW, La Mer, Origins and Estée Lauder. Clinique brand also depicted solid growth. However, skincare sales were partly hindered by soft Aveda sales.Makeup revenues were up 16% (up 13% on a constant currency basis) to $1,515 million on the back of incremental sales stemming from the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced. Tom Ford, Estée Lauder sand MAC brands also generated robust sales.Fragrance category reported revenue growth of 14% (up 10% on a constant currency basis) to reach $565 million driven by increased sales of luxury brands and Estée Lauder fragrances.Hair Care sales amounted $144 million that advanced 5% (4% on a constant currency basis), driven by higher sales of Bumble and bumble and Aveda brands. While Aveda gained from solid online performance, Bumble and bumble sales were backed by its launch in Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report). These were somewhat countered by lower salon sales.Regional ResultsSales in the Americas increased 5% (on a constant currency basis as well) to $1,308 million, with North American sales benefiting from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA and improvements in many other brands. This in turn was backed by higher holiday season demand. The company’s online and specialty-multi channels also registered strong growth in the region. Sales in Latin America and Canada also witnessed noteworthy improvements. All these upsides were partially offset by soft retail traffic in few U.S. brick-and-mortar stores.Sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa region improved 20% (up 15% on a constant currency basis) to $1,562 million owing to double-digit sales growth in retail travel sales and in regions like Italy, Benelux and India. Moreover, emerging markets like Russia and Turkey contributed to sales growth. Foreign currency changes also favorably impacted the region’s results, with UK and Italy being the main contributors. However, the Middle East region registered lower sales owing to macroeconomic challenges.In the Asia/Pacific region sales soared 33% (up 30% on a constant currency basis) to $874 million. The upside was driven by spectacular performance in Hong Kong, Thailand and China, while Taiwan and Japan also posted handsome gains.Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $ 2,105 million, long-term debt of $3,374 million and total equity of $4,589 million.Net cash flows from operating activities for the first half of fiscal 2018 came in at $1,450 million, while the company incurred capital expenditures of $263 million.Estée Lauder also announced a quarterly dividend of 38 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 15, to shareholders of record as of Feb 28.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceEstée Lauder expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is expected to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation and improved market reach are expected to positively impact sales during the year. However, economic challenges, social and political issues affecting consumer behavior in certain countries keeps management somewhat cautious. The company also remains watchful regarding soft store traffic in the United States.   Nevertheless, the growth drivers, a solid first half and expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keeps management encouraged about continuing with its above-industry improvement —  in the second half and fiscal 2018.  That said, management raised its sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, alongside providing a favorable view for the third quarter.For fiscal 2018, Estée Lauder now expects net sales to grow 12.5-13.5%, from the previous expectation of 10-11%.

2651,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its effective marketing initiatives, loyalty program, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations and strength in prestige cosmetics. Additionally, favorable traffic is driving comparable store sales (comps) growth. The company’s notable growth in e-commerce sales has also helped it stand out amid intense online competition.However, declining margins and stiff competition remain impediments. The company shares have declined 13.6% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 19.8%.Let’s delve deeper to analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stock.Splendid Earnings History & Robust OutlookUlta Beauty has maintained a solid earnings surprise trend having reported 16 straight quarters of earnings beat. Moreover, the company’s top line has surpassed estimates in 15 of the last 16 quarters. Of late, solid top- and bottom-line performances can be attributed to enhanced market share gains and benefits from attractive loyalty program offers. Additionally, the company is witnessing solid growth across all product categories with prestige cosmetics standing out. Further, robust traffic at stores is boosting comps, which improved double-digits in the most recent quarter.Looking ahead, the company expects to deliver comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 10-11% for 2017. Meanwhile, it anticipates e-commerce sales growth in a range of 50-60%. Earnings per share are envisioned to grow in the high twenties percentage range.Robust Online and Omni-Channel GrowthUlta Beauty has garnered goodwill in a short span amid stiff competition because of its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. Also, the company has successfully managed to grow both e-commerce and in-store sales. Evidently, the company registered whopping 62.9% growth in e-commerce sales, which reflects about 370 bps of the total comps growth. The increase in e-commerce sales was driven by traffic growth of 57% and mobile traffic surge of 92%. The omni-channel customers now form nearly 9.1% of the company’s loyalty members compared with 7.5% in the year-ago period.Effective Merchandise InitiativesUlta Beauty’s effective merchandising offerings largely contribute to growth of in-store sales. Notably, the company’s stores are a one stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, featuring prestige and discount beauty brands as well as offering salon products and services all under one roof. Also, the company remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings and improving store traffic with superior services. In fiscal 2016, the company had added 69 new brands and executed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores.Adding to its portfolio of prestige brands, the beauty retailer also rolled out Estee lauder’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand this year. Ulta plans to expand this to about 120 stores by the end of fiscal 2017.Sturdy Loyalty ProgramUlta Beauty’s loyalty program was one of the major sales drivers in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Buoyed by its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors and in-store conversions, Ulta Beauty saw 21% growth in Ultamate Rewards members to $26.4 million by the end of October. Moreover, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained sturdy in the quarter.Final ThoughtsWhile all seems well, Ulta Beauty witnessed a decline in both gross and operating margins in the fiscal third quarter. Also, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives may hinder customers’ loyalty for the brand and thus impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner. Nevertheless, we believe the solid initiatives taken by the company will help it to overcome these hindrances.Do Retail-Miscellaneous Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2653,ULTA,"(0:30) - Nifty Fifty: Secular Bulls Of The Past(5:45) - Lessons To Learn From The Nifty Fifty(9:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks: Fizzled Out Growth Stocks(16:10) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #64 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The growth stocks are still on a rampage, with FANG, the biotechs and the semiconductor stocks soaring in 2017.A lot of people in the media like to compare this market with the late 1990s dot-com era but Tracey thinks it more closely resembles the late 1960s and early 1970s bull market.And for value investors, that means having patience.The Rise of the Nifty FiftyIn the 1960s, growth stocks were also all the rage with investors jumping into a group of about 50 stocks that took on the popular name “The Nifty Fifty.”These were considered blue chip stocks where nothing could go wrong.  Investors were willing to buy them at whatever valuation in order to get their innovation and growth. Sound familiar?By the time of the 1972 bear market, the group was trading with an average valuation of 50x.But then, these growth stocks fizzled, and the stock market along with them.Today, investors are willing to pay a high price for many of the cutting-edge growth stocks. But some are already fizzling.Could the fizzling growth stocks be value stocks? Or are they value traps?5 Growth Stocks That Are Out of Favor1.     Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report)) shares have fallen 56% over the last 2 years. The PR issues it faced in late 2015 haven’t yet abated. The shares are no longer the darling of Wall Street. But is it a value at this level?2.    Ulta (ULTA  -  Free Report)) shares are down 20% year-to-date as the analysts are concerned it’s going to be Amazoned. It once traded as high as 35x earnings and is now at 23x. Is it a value?3.    Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)) was once one of the top growth stocks. It was expected to take the mantle away from Nike as the top apparel sportswear and shoe maker. But shares are down 43% year-to-date. They once traded near $50 and are now around $16. Is it time to get in?4.    General Electric (GE  -  Free Report)) is trading at multi-year lows with shares down 27% in 2017. Wall Street has turned its back on this once “sure thing” blue chip. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.3. Should value investors be interested?5.    Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)) had been flying high for years as its movies have dominated the box office, especially the Star Wars franchise. But shares are down 10% over the last 2 years, underperforming the overall stock market. They used to trade around 20x earnings but now trade at just 15.3 times. Is this a buying opportunity?While many of the Nifty Fifty companies are still around and trading on the exchanges, such as Walmart, Coke and IBM, quite a few are now defunct or a shadow of their former selves including Schlitz Brewing, Polaroid and Eastman Kodak.Additionally, after the bear market of the 1970s, it took years for some of the Nifty Fifty companies to again hit their pre-bear highs.That’s a reminder for investors that, in the end, valuation does matter.What else should you know about finding value in the fizzling growth stocks?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Further, growth across all product categories, particularly prestige cosmetics; solid marketing initiatives, outstanding e-commerce growth and continued progress at the company’s salon operations provided an impetus.Strength in Loyalty Program Drives Q3One of the major sales drivers of Ulta Beauty’s third-quarter performance was its loyalty program. The company grew its Ultimate Rewards members by 21% to $26.4 million by the end of October 2017 aided by its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors and in store-conversions. Moreover, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained sturdy in the third quarter.Growth of Online and Omni-Channel Bode WellUlta Beauty, known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores has been able to garner goodwill in a short span and remained immune to the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) -dominated market.Notably, the company registered whopping 62.9% growth in e-commerce sales in the third quarter driven by increase in online and mobile traffic. The omni-channel customers now form nearly 9.1% of the company’s loyalty members compared with 7.5% in the year-ago period. Further, management reiterated its fiscal 2017 e-commerce sales growth forecast to the range of 50-60%. Alongside, the company focuses on strengthening e-commerce business by enhancing supply chain capabilities.Extensive Merchandise OfferingsUlta Beauty has created a niche market on the back a wide range of beauty products it offers. The company’s business model, focused on “All Things Beauty, All in One Place”, makes Ulta a go-to destination for cosmetics and beauty product lovers. Further, the company remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings along with store traffic with superior services.Adding to its portfolio of prestige brands, the beauty retailer rolled out Estee lauder’s most popular MAC brand, which is the No. 1 prestige beauty products brand in the United States, this year. Also, the company plans to expand it to about 120 stores by the end of fiscal 2017.DeterrentsThough the company’s fundamentals look strong, there were certain catch points that have been hurting investors’ sentiment. Among the drawbacks, the company’s top line missed estimates in the third quarter, which was its first in more than three years.. Further, the recent decline in both gross and operating margins, a slowdown in the rate of comparable store sales growth from the year-ago and sequential periods and a not so encouraging guidance for the fourth quarter are impediments. Consequently, shares of Ulta Beauty plunged 20.5% in the last six months wider than the industry’s dip of 1.6%.Do Retail-Miscellaneous Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2656,ULTA,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market, the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund (QQEW  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 04/19/2006.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexManaged by First Trust Advisors, QQEW has amassed assets over $546.73 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index before fees and expenses.The NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index is the equal-weighted version of the NASDAQ-100 Index which includes 100 of the largest non-financial securities listed on NASDAQ based on market capitalization.Cost & Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.45%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 42% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Shire Plc (adr) (SHPG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.24% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) and Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report).QQEW's top 10 holdings account for about 11.49% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskQQEW has gained about 3.74% so far this year, and as of 05/14/2018, is up about 13.98% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $52.12 and $63.23.The ETF has a beta of 1.14 and standard deviation of 15.67% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 103 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFirst Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF  -  Free Report) tracks Russell 1000 Growth Index and the PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report) tracks NASDAQ-100 Index. IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF has $41.74 B in assets, PowerShares QQQ has $62.90 B. IWF has an expense ratio of 0.20% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

The company envisions earnings per share of 20-22 cents for the fiscal first quarter.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Impact 1Q18American Eagle has been grappling with soft margins for a while now. The decline in margins can be attributed to higher promotions along with increased shipping costs and compensation. Further, the company’s attempt to expand globally exposes it to adverse currency movements and other international risks.Although American Eagle's expansion plans and omni-channel growth are likely to strengthen its business, high dependence on external suppliers and macroeconomic headwinds might weigh on results. Evidently, the company delivered negative surprises in two of the last four quarters, with in-line earnings in the previous quarter.However, the stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, owing to the company’s impressive comps trend. Also, it has been gaining from strong online sales at both brands due to efficient use of omni-channel capabilities for enhancing customer experience.In the last three months, shares of the company have rallied 13.4% against the industry’s decline of 5.4%. What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Eagle is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

2658,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on May 31, after the closing bell. The company has a robust earnings history, having delivered positive earnings surprises for more than three years. However, it broke the trend in the last reported quarter with a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48 for the first quarter increased by a penny in the last seven days and reflects a year-over-year improvement of 29.8%. Management envisions earnings per share within $2.43-$2.48 for the quarter.Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise |  QuoteSo let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Influencing 1Q18Ulta Beauty’s effective marketing initiatives, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations and strength in prestige cosmetics bode well. Notably, Ulta Beauty recorded 60.4% growth in e-commerce sales in last reported quarter, which helped it to stand out amid intense online competition. Additionally, favorable traffic is driving its comparable store sales (comps) growth. Further, the company has been gaining from enhanced market share gains and benefits from loyalty program, which have been significantly contributing to its results. These are likely to prove conducive to the company’s upcoming quarterly results.These initiatives have also aided the stock to outperform the industry in the last three months. The stock has returned 27.2%, while the industry gained 2.8%.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, management anticipates net sales in the $1,506-$1,519 million band. Comps, including e-commerce sales, are predicted to grow 6-7%.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues for the first quarter to come in at $1,525 million, up nearly 16% from the year-ago period. Further, the consensus estimate for salon business’ revenues is pegged at $80 million, up 8.5% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.However, Ulta Beauty has been grappling with soft margins for a while now. The company witnessed contraction of both gross and operating margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points due to deleveraged merchandise margins and one-time bonus payment with respect to tax reforms. Higher SG&A expenses along with lower gross margin led to the decline in operating margin.Further, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives might deter buyers’ loyalty for the brand, consequently impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

2659,ULTA,"PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 30. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer and marketer of branded apparel, footwear and other accessories will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.The company delivered positive earnings surprise of 6.8% in the last reported quarter. It outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 3.9%.

The company’s shares have increased 51.5% while the industry recorded growth of 43.4%.Factors at PlayPVH boasts a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for 15 consecutive quarters along with six straight quarters of sales beat. This robust surprise trend is mainly backed by significant momentum at its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions. Additionally, currency tailwinds are favoring the company.Moreover, PVH Corp.’s diversified brand portfolio allows it to stay ahead of its peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain its position in the current challenging environment. The company’s approach to brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through effective marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWe note that DICK’S Sporting has underperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting a negative sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have declined 8.1% against the industry’s increase of 6.3%. The stock is troubled by the soft top-line performance in the last-reported quarter, due to softness in hunting and electronic categories. Additionally, the company’s margins continue to be strained for the past few quarters.Moreover, the company expects the hunting and firearm, as well as electronics businesses, to experience headwinds throughout fiscal 2018, which will hurt the top line. The hunting and firearm business will continue to be impacted by the recent changes to the company’s firearm policies, while the electronics business will be hurt by reduced exposure to this business. While innovations and growth of private brands are likely to ease margin pressures in fiscal 2018, the company still anticipates margins to be negative. Consolidated operating margins are expected to decrease year over year in fiscal 2018, due to SG&A deleverage, relating to increased investments in business and restoration of incentive compensation to historic levels.However, the company’s investments in e-commerce, store technology and store payroll, as well as DICK'S Team Sports HQ and private brands, are likely to enrich customers’ experience and drive market share growth. Also, the company remains on track to expand its e-commerce business. Further, it plans to make significant investments in the business as it remains confident about the long-term potential and tremendous opportunities in the evolving industry.

2661,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) is one of those few companies that has kept its robust surprise history intact even amid a tough retail landscape. While hurdles like consumers changing preferences and stiff competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) have plagued the entire retail space, Ulta Beauty’s superb growth endeavors have helped the company sail through these headwinds.  So, let’s delve deeper into Ulta Beauty’s strategies and see if they can continue to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company keep up its solid show.Omni-channel Strategy Remains a Major Growth DriverTalking of Ulta Beauty’s growth initiatives, the company’s focus on omni-channel development takes the center stage. Apart from growing in-store sales, the company has been recording solid improvements at its online business. Notably, the company registered whopping 72.3% growth in e-commerce sales in second-quarter fiscal 2017, which reflects about 340 bps of the total comps growth recorded in the quarter. The increase in e-commerce sales was driven by traffic growth of 73% which included a 104% surge in mobile traffic. The superb e-commerce performance encouraged management to upgrade its fiscal 2017 e-commerce sales growth forecast to a range of 50-60% from around 50%.Store Expansion on TrackDespite consumers’ shift to online shopping, Ulta Beauty remains keen on growing store base. Evidently, in the first half of the fiscal, the company opened 38 stores, while relocated and remodeled three and five stores, respectively. Further, the company plans to open 100 stores in fiscal 2017, including 50 openings planned for the third quarter.Loyalty Program Woos Customers, Aids Top-Line GrowthUlta Beauty’s loyalty program was one of the major sales driver in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Thanks to its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors and in store conversions, Ulta Beauty grew its ultimate rewards members by 23% to 25.4 million by the end of July. Further, the company added 1.4 new members in the second quarter, which took its total new member count to 5 million in the past one year. Notably, this helped the company raise its market share in the beauty enthusiast space to 27%. Moreover, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained sturdy. Management also stated that it expects its ultimate rewards credit card to contribute significantly to the top line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and Consensus  Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and Consensus | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteThese factors, along with impressive merchandise offerings helped Ulta Beauty deliver better-than-expected top- and bottom-line results consistently for over three years now. Evidently, second-quarter fiscal 2017 marked Ulta Beauty’s 15th straight quarter of earnings and sales beat. Encouraged by the sturdy results, management perked up its fiscal 2017 guidance, reflecting the company’s strong prospects. Moreover, Ulta Beauty boasts long-term earnings per share growth rate of 20%, which highlights its inherent strength.Obstacles in Ulta Beauty’s Path — Will it Deter Growth?However, it’s not that Ulta Beauty is completely immune to all industry hurdles. Though the company has been performing well, it remains vulnerable to the intense online competition owing to consumers’ evolving preferences. While Ulta Beauty’s comparable store sales (comps) grew in the last quarter, the rate of growth decelerated from the year-ago period, reflecting a slowing beauty market. Some analysts also believe that costs associated with efforts to grow online business could weigh upon Ulta Beauty’s margins. Additionally, the company’s limited brand awareness and challenges related to cheaper alternatives remain concerns for Ulta Beauty.These hurdles have caused shares of this cosmetics retailer to slide 6.2% over a year. Nevertheless, it has performed better than the industry which tumbled 11.8% in the said time frame. So, let’s see if Ulta Beauty can continue to tide over the retail barriers with its sturdy growth ammunitions.Looking for More Promising Bets?

2664,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report), which has been delivering positive earnings and sales surprises consistently for more than three years, kept its earnings streak alive in third-quarter fiscal 2017 as well. Though, sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, both the top and bottom lines improved year over year. Also, management reaffirmed its outlook for the year.  Results in the quarter were fueled by market share gains and benefits from compelling offers through the company’s impressive loyalty program. Growth across all product categories, where prestige cosmetics continued to outperform also added to the solid performance. Strong marketing initiatives, outstanding e-commerce improvement and continued progress at the company’s salon operations were the other elements that drove results.However, shares of this cosmetics retailer lost 4.9% in the after-hours trading on Nov 30.  Despite an earnings beat, investors punished the stock on its top-line miss, the first in more than three years. Also, management reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. Further, the company’s not so encouraging outlook for the final quarter also hurt investors' sentiments. Additionally, the rate of comparable store sales (comps) growth decelerated from the year-ago and sequential periods. The company’s gross and operating margins too declined in the quarter.In the past one month, Ulta Beauty has gained 9.3% almost in line with the industry’s growth.Robust Q3 NumbersComing to numbers, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company posted adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 and soared 21.4% year over year. This included favorable impacts of 4 cents from lower tax rate and 3 cents from lower share count, compensated with nearly 8 cents attributable to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma adverse impacts.Net sales increased 18.6% year over year to $1,342.2 million but it marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,343 million. The year-over-year improvement in revenues was driven by solid comps growth and e-commerce sales.Comps (including stores and e-commerce) improved 10.3% compared with 16.7% growth in the prior-year quarter. Comps growth came on the back of favorable traffic and ticket along with store growth and stupendous e-commerce improvement. During the third quarter, the company registered transaction growth of 6% while average ticket was up 4.3%. Nonetheless, the Hurricanes Harvey and Irma adversely impacted comps by about 100 basis points (bps).Retail business (comprising retail and salon) witnessed comps growth of 6.6% that include 3.8% improvement for salon. Sales for the salon business grew 10.8% to $66.9 million. Also, Ulta Beauty witnessed whopping 62.9% growth in e-commerce sales to $119.8 million, reflecting about 370 bps of the total comps growth in the quarter.Gross profit improved 15.5% year over year to $493.1 million. However, the gross profit margin contracted 110 bps to 36.7% due to deleveraged merchandise margins.While operating income advanced 16.5% year over year to $162.7 million, operating margin declined 30 bps to 12.1%. The contraction in operating margin was owing to a fall in gross margin, somewhat offset by a 90 bps decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. However, pre-opening expenses escalated 40.6% to $9.7 million.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc.

2666,ULTA,"Yes, you read that title right. While the overarching narrative surrounding the retail industry may be to “get out now because retail is dying,” there are still some companies out there that are worth taking a long, hard look at.One of the biggest factors impacting retailers, of course, is e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Having become much more than just an online bookseller, Amazon has grown to be a digital one-stop shop for almost everything these days. But there are certain markets that Amazon hasn’t completely dominated, and retailers operating in these particular corners of the industry are thriving.Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), for instance, is one of the hottest retailers, if not stocks, out there right now. Its in-store and online sales continually grow quarter after quarter, and the company has built a loyal customer base through its rewards program.The retail industry may be struggling, but it’s not dead yet. Let’s take a look at 3 retail stocks investors should consider for their portfolio.1. Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report)Lululemon is a yoga-inspired athletic apparel company that has become a leader in the fitness world since its founding in 1998. The company makes a number of different types of athletic wear for women, men, and kids, and while it operates in the ultra-competitive “athleisure” market, Lulu has been able to stay on top because of its luxe status and loyal customer base.In its most recent quarter, Lulu surprised investors with an all-around impressive report. Both the top and bottom line beat analyst estimates and improved year-over-year, and these positive results were driven by the company’s continued product innovation. For instance, customers have been flocking to Lulu’s $98 Enlite Bra, and the brand’s increasing appeal to men are both benefits that help set the company apart from competitors Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Gap’s (GPS  -  Free Report) Athleta.Looking ahead, Lulu expects earnings growth of 12.4% for the current year, with 15 analysts revising their estimates upwards in the last 30 days compared to none lower; sales are expected to grow about 10.3% in the same time frame. With a P/E of over 25, Lulu is not cheap. Investors, though, have always been willing to pay more for a stock because of perceived stature, and Lululemon is in the upper echelons of athletic wear. What’s more, LULU is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).2. Tilly’s (TLYS  -  Free Report)Tilly’s is a popular teen retailer based in Irvine, California, and is known for its trendy, SoCal-inspired clothing and accessories geared towards surfing, skateboarding, and snowboarding. Similar to rival Zumiez , Tilly’s sells brands like Adidas Originals (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Vans, RVCA, Billabong, Hurley, and Converse, among many others.Tilly’s has been a strong performer since its better-than-expected second quarter earnings, having gained roughly 34% since it beat both top and bottom line estimates. In particular, comparable store sales, which includes e-commerce, increased 2.1%, a noticeable increase from the 0.9% growth seen in the year-ago quarter. Tilly’s smartly marketed to the back-to-school crowd, highlighting popular brands that teenagers covet and showing investors that the company knows and understands its core customer.A #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Tilly’s is looking at almost 20% earnings growth for the current year, with about 1.2% sales growth in same time period. Its P/E of nearly 21 comes in well above the Retail-Apparel and Shoes industry, a reflection both of Tilly’s perception among investors and its popularity with its teen customers. While its steep drop in valuation over the last year shows how skeptical investors became in teen retailers, and retail overall, Tilly’s looks to be on the rebound.3. Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report)Originally known as Burlington Coat Factory, Burlington Stores is a leading off-price retailer. It sells everything from women’s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth apparel, baby products, footwear, accessories, and home goods.Since the financial crisis nearly a decade ago, discount chains like Burlington have thrived, in part because it is a company that knows its customer--and that customer likes the thrill of a treasure hunt--but the retailer has also adapted to meet the demands of its core base over the years.Its earnings results have reflected these changes, and it has worked in Burlington’s favor. Last quarter, the discount chain continued its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017, surging past top and bottom line estimates; comps grew 3.5%, marking the 18th straight quarter of growth in this category.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Burlington plans on focusing more on its home, beauty, and women’s apparel categories, in addition to opening 37 net new stores. The retailer expects earnings growth of almost 30% for the current year, with sales increasing 8.8% in the same time frame. Since early 2016, BURL has consistently traded above the S&P 500. Its current P/E of right around 21 is a reflection of the rise of off-price retailers, and the high-value placed on these companies right now in the retail space.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2667,ULTA,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — announced the opening of three new retailers — DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), Field & Stream and HomeGoods — at Viewmont Mall in Scranton, PA, within the space which was previously occupied by Sears Holdings Corp. .This marks the conclusion of the anchor-improvement program at this mall which is aimed at diversifying the tenant mix, meet shoppers’ demand and boost sales per square feet of this retail property.HomeGoods occupies 23,000 square feet of space in the property, while DICK’S Sporting Goods and Field & Stream occupy 90,000 square feet in one dual store concept store.Notably, PREIT had recaptured the spaces previously occupied by Sears and secured these high-performing replacement anchors for filling up the spaces again. This was achieved within 14 months of Sears’ closing.In fact, PREIT has been strategically focusing on enhancing the value of the Viewmont Mall through its portfolio-wide remerchandising efforts. The company added national tenants — Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), Wild Wings and others — together with new prototype stores for a number of major tenants. With these diligent efforts, the company has been able to organically increase 16% in sales per square feet since Dec 31, 2013.No doubt, the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. In addition, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a choppy retail market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to boost the productivity of the malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones on the other hand.PREIT, too, along with its remerchandising efforts, has resorted to a portfolio rejig, selling 17 lower productivity malls, as well as other non-core properties since January 2013. This helped the company reap more than $750 million in gross proceeds. (Read more: PREIT Closes Sale of 17th Low-Productivity Mall for $33.2M)The company’s above discussed efforts are likely to help it efficiently tide over the lackluster retail environment and ride on the growth curve as well.PREIT currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s shares have descended 9.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 3%.

The year-over-year rise in revenues was driven by solid comps growth and e-commerce sales.Comps (including stores and e-commerce) were up 8.8% compared with 16.6% in the prior-year quarter. Comps growth came on the back of a favorable traffic and ticket along with store growth and a stupendous e-commerce improvement.

However, the gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 34% due to deleveraged merchandise margins and one-time bonus payment with respect to tax reforms.While adjusted operating income increased 19% year over year to $266.7 million, adjusted operating margin declined 40 bps to 13.8%. The contraction in operating margin was due to a fall in gross margin coupled with 60 bps rise in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. However, pre-opening expenses dipped 2.3% to $4.3 million.Other FinancialsUlta Beauty ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $277.4 million, short-term investments of $120 million and shareholders’ equity of $1,774.2 million.

With this, the company stands to operate 1,074 stores at the end of fiscal 2017 while increasing its total square footage by 10% year over year.Going forward, the company plans to open 100 net new stores plus remodel or relocate 17 outlets in fiscal 2018.OutlookManagement issued guidance for fiscal 2018 and the first quarter. Ulta Beauty remains impressed with a year-over-year improvement in the top and bottom line owing to continued market share gains and benefits from strategic initiatives. Going ahead, the company expects to use a part of the tax reform gains to invest in people, product innovations as well as other strategies to boost growth.Further, Ulta Beauty implements a cost optimization plan to benefit the areas of indirect procurement, operational efficiency, real estate expenses and merchandise margins. This plan will likely fuel operating profit margin growth rate in the long run. However, in fiscal 2018, the operating margin is projected to decline at a modest rate. Also, the company remains encouraged to deliver industry leading results in the near term.For fiscal 2018, the company expects total sales to grow in low teens’ percentage with comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 6-8%. In the meantime, the company continues to anticipate its e-commerce sales growth by 40%.Notably, Ulta Beauty expects to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, thereby contributing to sales by roughly $50 million and reducing the operating margin rate by nearly 20 bps.

2670,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) is primed up to stand out in a backdrop where retailers continue to struggle tough competition from growth of online retailers. This fervor is mainly backed by its splendid surprise history, robust marketing initiatives and solid e-Commerce as well as omni-channel focus. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock boasts a VGM Score of B, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 20%, which also highlights its inherent potential. Let’s delve deep to find out more.Solid Surprise History & OutlookThis leading beauty retailer has been consistent with its performance, recording top and bottom-line beat for over three years now. Notably, the company maintained this robust trend in second-quarter fiscal 2017 as well, which marked its 15th straight quarter of earnings and sales beat. Results benefited from enhanced market share gains and solid loyalty program offers. Further, growth across all product categories, particularly prestige cosmetics, aided results. Additionally, the company continued to gain from strong marketing initiatives, outstanding e-Commerce improvement and continued progress at the company’s salon operations.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteMoreover, comparable store sales (comps) improved double digit in the quarter driven by favorable traffic. Encouraged by the sturdy results, management perked up fiscal 2017 guidance. The company now expects to deliver comps growth (including e-Commerce) in the range of 10-11%, up from the old projection of 9-11%. Earnings per share growth rate is now envisioned in high-twenties percentage band, compared with mid-twenties percentage range guided earlier.Loyalty Program Benefits ResultsUlta Beauty’s loyalty program was a key driver of sales in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Thanks to its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors and in store conversions, Ulta Beauty increased ultimate rewards members by 23% to 25.4 million by the end of July. Further, the company added 1.4 new members in the second quarter, which took total new member count to 5 million in a year.Notably, this helped the company raise market share in the beauty enthusiast space to 27%. Moreover, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained sturdy. Management also stated that it expects ultimate rewards credit card to contribute significantly to the top line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Online and Omni-channel Initiatives Gives an EdgeUlta Beauty is known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. This is probably one of the reasons behind its garnering goodwill in a short span and also remaining immune to the Amazon-dominated market. Notably, the company registered whopping 72.3% growth in e-Commerce sales in second-quarter fiscal 2017, which reflects about 340 basis points of the total comps growth. This was driven by traffic growth of 73% which included a 104% surge in mobile traffic. Further, omni-channel customers now form nearly 8.8% of its loyalty members, compared with 7.2% in the same year-ago period.The superb e-Commerce performance encouraged management to upgrade fiscal 2017 e-Commerce sales growth forecast to a range of 50-60%, from around 50% expected earlier. Alongside, the company is focused on strengthening e-Commerce business by enhancing supply chain capabilities.Possible DeterrentsHowever, all is not well for Ulta Beauty. Shares of this cosmetics retailer lost 10.9% in a month, wider than the industry’s 4.9% fall.While the company is fundamentally sound, the possible reason for the recent slowdown is the marginal top-line beat recorded in the second quarter. Further, the rate of comps growth decelerated from the year-ago period, which turned down investors’ enthusiasm. Additionally, the company’s limited global brand awareness, challenges related to cheaper alternatives and changing consumer preference remain ongoing concerns.Nevertheless, we believe Ulta Beauty can easily overcome these headwinds on the back of robust growth strategies.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

2677,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) is slated to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Mar 15. In the preceding quarter, it came up with a positive earnings surprise of 1.8%.In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.1%. In fact, it delivered an earnings beat for 16 straight quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote What to Expect?Investors are keen on finding out whether Ulta Beauty will be able to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 is pegged at $2.77 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 23.7%. However, the consensus mark has been witnessing a downtrend in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.94 billion, representing a 22.6% increase from the year-ago quarter.Nonetheless, we note that shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has declined 9%, wider than the industry’s decrease of 0.9%. Factors at PlayUlta Beauty has been gaining from its effective marketing initiatives, loyalty program, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations as well as strength in prestige cosmetics. Additionally, a favorable traffic is driving comparable store sales (comps) growth. Its notable growth in e-commerce sales has also helped it stand out amid intense online competition.Furthermore, Ulta Beauty has maintained a solid earnings surprise trend, having reported 16 straight quarters of earnings beat. The company’s top line has also surpassed estimates in 15 of the last 16 quarters. Robust top and bottom-line performances can be attributed to enhanced market share gains and benefits from attractive loyalty program offers. Additionally, the company is witnessing sturdy growth across all product categories with prestige cosmetics standing out.Looking ahead, the company expects comps growth (including e-commerce) in the 10-11% range for fiscal 2017. Meanwhile, it anticipates e-commerce sales growth of 50-60%. Earnings per share are envisioned to rise in the band of high 20s’ percentage.However, declining margins and stiff competition remain impediments. Ulta Beauty witnessed contraction of both gross and operating margins in the fiscal third quarter. Also, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives might hinder buyers’ loyalty for the brand, thereby impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ulta Beauty has an Earnings ESP of -1.38% and a Zacks Rank #2. While the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:DICK’S Sporting Goods Corp.

2678,ULTA,"Stocks opened higher on Friday after the February jobs report came in ahead of expectations and cooled concerns about rising inflation. But as the latest employment numbers seemingly confirm the overall health of the U.S. economy, recent earnings results in the retail sector have started to raise questions about the state of consumer spending.For the most part, fourth-quarter earnings season was relatively strong. However, results in the retail space were somewhat mixed. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates—and over the past few days, we have seen disappointing reports from Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), and more (also read: Kroger Extends Disappointing Week for Retail Sector Earnings Reports).The traditional earnings season is effectively over, but a few marquee reports—especially in the retail sector—remain to be released.

(DKS  -  Free Report)Sporting goods retailer Dick’s is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on March 13. Dick’s recently grabbed headlines for its decision to change its own gun sales rules in the wake of several mass shootings, but now investors will want to see how the company has actually been performing lately.DKS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate, we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, down about 9% year over year. However, total quarterly revenues are expect to improve nearly 10% to touch $2.73 billion. 2. Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Discount retail giant Dollar General is slated to post its most recent quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on March 15. The pressure will be on the company after fellow “dollar store” retailer Dollar Tree failed to impress this week. DG is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share and revenues of $6.22 billion. This earnings results would be basically flat year over year, while the revenue projection would mark a 3.5% improvement. The key for Dollar General will be whether or not its core customer base—lower income families—have started to feel a noticeable tax break and have been spending the extra money for shopping purposes. 3. Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)Beauty retailer Ulta is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results after the market closes on March 15.

2679,ULTA,"On Friday, shares of Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) are falling, down over 8% in afternoon trading on the heels of the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings report.At first glance, Ulta delivered strong results, reporting earnings of $1.83 per share and revenues of $1.29 billion. Both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and growing 20.6% and 27.9%, respectively. Comparable store sales grew 11.7%, while e-commerce sales increased an incredible 72.3% during the quarter.The beauty giant, as a result, raised part of its guidance for fiscal 2017. Ulta now expects comps growth, including e-commerce, in the range of 10-11%, up from previous projections of 9-11%. The company also boosted its outlook for online sales growth, in addition to opening 100 net new stores.But if you take a closer look, Ulta’s results were perhaps not as positive as they first seemed. While revenues came in ahead of estimates, the beat was marginal. Comps growth, though impressive, was down from the 14.4% increase in the year-ago period. Ulta’s forecast, while matching analysts’ expectations, seemed to be a little less than what investors expected.Reaction today has been harsh, both from investors and from analysts. BMO Capital Markets downgraded ULTA stock to market perform from outperform. Citing an overall beauty market, BMO analysts said that while Ulta has many advantages to its names, like strong digital presence and a popular rewards program, there will be challenges ahead for the beauty retailer.Competition, they said, is heating up, everywhere from department stores becoming more promotional with their beauty departments, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) potentially partnering with prestige beauty site Violet Grey, and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) leveraging its Bluemercuy acquisition. Analyst Shannon Coyne believes Ulta will see its “competitive moat recede over the next 12-to-24 months.”Ulta In-DepthULTA is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘A.’ Year-to-date, the stock is down nearly 9%, and has fallen almost 14% over the past 12 months.There’s no denying that Ulta has suffered recently as the beauty market evolves, with investors growing concerned that the company can keep up its tremendous growth streak. But what we have to remember is that as a retail, brick-and-mortar business, Ulta will mature at some point, and comparable store sales growth should be expected to come in lower eventually.On the other hand, Ulta’s digital sales are booming. In addition to over 70% growth in e-commerce sales, online traffic was up 73%, while mobile traffic was up 104% thanks to investments in digital marketing, pay channels—think pay search affiliate display re-targeting—and paid social, including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), and YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report). And through Ulta’s app, traffic surged 450% year-over-year, with 41 million visits during the quarter.GlobalData Retail analyst Anthony Riva points out that “online margins are reasonably strong and the gap with physical is much smaller than it is for many other retailers…This means online growth makes a steady contribution to the bottom line,” he said in a note emailed to Retail Dive.Ulta is still one of the best retailers out there, and while this latest earnings report showed some minor hiccups, the company is still leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. With an incredible online initiative combined with products that deeply resonate with customers, Ulta will likely continue to be a leader in the beauty industry for a long time.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2681,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report), which has been delivering positive earnings and sales surprises consistently for over three years, kept its robust trend alive in second-quarter fiscal 2017 as well. Both the top line and the bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus mark, alongside improving year over year. The sturdy quarter also called for a perked-up guidance for fiscal 2017. Clearly, the company continues to stand out, as it is one of the very few retailers to perform well even amid stiff competition from online giants like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteBut, all is not well for Ulta Beauty. Shares of this cosmetics retailer lost 5.6% in the after-market trading session on Aug 24 despite the stellar results. Though the top line came ahead of estimates, the beat was very marginal. Also, the rate of comparable store sales (comps) growth decelerated from the year-ago period. While management’s outlook for the third quarter was somewhat in sync with analysts’ expectations, it looks like investors were expecting a more encouraging forecast. Well, these could be the possible reasons behind the downward bend of the stock, which otherwise looks fundamentally sound. Following yesterday’s performance, Ulta Beauty has declined 8.4% year to date. However, it fared better than the industry’s 14.4% plunge.Results in the second quarter were fueled by market share gains and benefits from compelling offers through the company’s impressive loyalty program. Further, results were driven by growth across all product categories, where prestige cosmetics continued to outperform. Also, strong marketing initiatives, outstanding e-Commerce improvement and continued progress at the company’s salon operations drove results.Solid Q2 NumbersComing to numbers, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company posted adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 and soared 27.9% year over year. This included a favorable impact of 2 cents from the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fiscal 2017 beginning.Net sales advanced 20.6% year over year to $1,289.9 million, marginally exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,287.8 million. The upside was driven by solid comps and productivity from new stores.Comps (including stores and e-Commerce) improved 11.7%, compared with 14.4% growth in the prior-year quarter. Comps growth came on the back of favorable traffic and ticket, along with store growth and stupendous e-Commerce improvement. During the quarter, the company registered transaction growth of 5.5% while average ticket was up 6.2%.Overall, retail business (comprising retail and salon) witnessed comps growth of 8.4%, including 7.7% improvement for salon. Retail comps growth was driven by 3.4% improvement in traffic and 5% rise in ticket. Ticket growth was aided by higher average selling price. In the salon business, improvement in comps was mainly backed by ticket growth.Sales for the salon business increased 15.3% to $68.0 million. Additionally, Ulta Beauty witnessed whopping 72.3% growth in e-Commerce sales to $96.3 million in the quarter. This reflects about 340 bps of the total comps growth recorded in the quarter.Gross profit grew roughly 22% year over year to $469.3 million. Further, the gross profit margin expanded 40 bps to 36.4%, attributable to improved merchandise margins and lower fixed store expenses.Operating income advanced 25.1% year over year to $179.8 million, while operating margin improved 50 bps to 14.0%. The expansion in operating margin is attributed to a 10 bps decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, along with the rise in gross margin. Preopening expenses, on the other hand, escalated 29.8% to $6.1 million.Other FinancialsUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $92.9 million, short-term investments of $180 million and shareholders’ equity of $1,635.4 million.

This includes 50 store openings planned for the third quarter.GuidanceFollowing an excellent quarter, Ulta Beauty raised its comps and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. The company now expects to deliver comps growth (including e-Commerce) in the range of 10-11%, up from the old projection of 9-11%.Further, the company upgraded its fiscal 2017 e-Commerce sales growth forecast to a range of 50-60%, from around 50% expected earlier. Consequently, management now envisions earnings per share growth to come in a high twenties percentage range up from mid-twenties percentage band guided previously.Earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2017 includes the impact of the additional 53rd week; nearly $350 million impact from share repurchases and the effect of tax rate benefit realized so far this year. However, the company will exclude all tax-related impacts from the adoption of the new accounting standard for the rest of fiscal 2017.Apart from this, Ulta Beauty expects to spend about $460 million toward capital expenditures in the fiscal, of which about $80 million will be used to fund the expansion of prestige brand.For fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates net sales in a range of $1,331-$1,353 million, compared with $1,131.2 million delivered in the prior-year quarter.

2682,ULTA,"Shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report) fell 3.5% in midday trading on Monday after the company’s stock received a lower price target and was downgraded by several analysts.Stifel Nicolaus lowered its price target on Ulta stock to $270, down from $325. Analysts cited concerns that the U.S. beauty industry is showing slower growth, while Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) is expanding into prestige brands and heightening competition.“Numerous data points suggest U.S. beauty category growth slowed in 2Q17, including from retailers Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Sephora, beauty companies L’Oreal and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF  -  Free Report) and scanner data measuring sales trends in food, drug, and mass channels” said analysts led by Mark Astrachan.Slowing makeup and mass-priced product sales could cause a huge problem for Ulta, as each category accounts for about 50% and 40% of the company’s total sales.However, Stifel remains positive on the stock. “We remain favorable on Ulta’s longer-term growth trajectory anticipating continued share gains of beauty retail sales, benefiting from the accelerating shift from traditional sales channels to specialty retailers, online, and mobile, and attributable to Ulta’s increasing focus on its loyalty program, targeted promotions, and new credit card program,” said the firm.“That said, we believe near-term trading could result in more downside than upside given broader multiple contraction in retail due to slowing category growth and fears of increased competition from Amazon.”OTR Global also downgraded Ulta from a positive rating to a mixed rating after interviewing suppliers about the impact of Amazon.ULTA is set to report its second quarter fiscal 2017 results this Thursday after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate predicts that the company will report earnings of $1.78 per share and revenue of $1.29 billion.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2684,ULTA,"Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter  2017 results on Feb 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company has outperformed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.8%.Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 23 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 30.3%. We note that the earnings estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $243.2 million down 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.In the past month, the stock has outperformed the industry. However, the company’s shares have lost 4.8%, much narrower than the industry’s decline of 10.5%.Factors at PlayBig 5 Sporting’s preliminary sales numbers for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 suggest that the quarter has been tough for the company. In the fourth quarter, the company continued with its dismal sales trend, with sales numbers lagging estimates and declining year over year. This downturn can be attributed to extremely challenging conditions in December.Sales in the quarter were hurt by nearly 50% decline in core winter product categories due to warm and dry weather conditions in most of its markets. Consequently, sales of cold weather and snow-related products declined. Furthermore, the company continued to witness awfully soft sales for firearm-related products, which significantly hurt customer traffic across the company’s store fleet. This, in turn, weighed on comparable store sales (comps) and merchandise margins.As a result, Big 5 Sporting slashed earnings guidance for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017. Moreover, the company notes that the dismal winter weather conditions have continued into the first quarter of 2018, thereby making comparisons with the prior-year period very tough. In fact, this has weakened investors’ outlook for the first quarter.However, Big 5 Sporting is well on track with its impressive growth strategies and effective merchandising initiatives. In addition, the company’s solid financials underscores strength in its operations.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Big 5 Sporting is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Big 5 Sporting has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:DICK’s Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.54% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Michaels Companies (MIK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.80% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Ulta Beauty Inc.

The contraction in operating margin was due to a fall in gross margin coupled with 60 bps rise in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. However, pre-opening expenses dipped 2.3% to $4.3 million.Other FinancialsUlta Beauty ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $277.4 million, short-term investments of $120 million and shareholders’ equity of $1,774.2 million.

Ulta Beauty remains impressed with an year-over-year improvement in the top and bottom line owing to continued market share gains and benefits from strategic initiatives. Going forward, the company expects to use a part of the tax reform gains to invest in people, product innovations as well as other strategies to boost growth.Further, Ulta Beauty implements a cost optimization plan to benefit the areas of indirect procurement, operational efficiency, real estate expenses and merchandise margins. This plan will likely fuel operating profit margin growth rate in the long run. However, in fiscal 2018, the operating margin is projected to decline at a modest rate. Also, the company remains encouraged to deliver industry leading results in the near term.For fiscal 2018, the company expects total sales to grow in low teens’ percentage with comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 6-8%. In the meantime, the company continues to anticipate its e-commerce sales growth 40%.Notably, Ulta Beauty expects to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, thereby contributing to sales by roughly $50 million and reduce the operating margin rate by nearly 20 bps. Further, the company plans to deleverage the operating margin rate in the band of 50-70 bps for the fiscal.Consequently, management envisions GAAP earnings per share growth in the 20% range inclusive of nearly $500 million impact from share repurchases.

2687,ULTA,"This is the last major week of the second quarter earnings season with only about 200 companies expected to report earnings.But the end of earnings season also signals that the retailers will be reporting and this week, there’s a slew of them from apparel retailers to home goods, furniture and jewelry.Is it really as bad out there at the mall as everyone is making it out to be?Several of the retailers reporting this week have been at the top of their game in the last year. They have even managed to beat on the estimate every quarter for nearly 5 years.I don’t care which industry you’re in, but beating nearly every quarter for that long of time is impressive.Will some of these retailers change the perception on the Street that retail is doomed? Or is the negative retail sentiment etched in stone?The Must-See Retail Earnings Charts This Week1.    Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) has actually missed three out of the last four quarters but it’s in the hot home remodeling industry so shares haven’t sold off much on the misses.

2688,ULTA,"Q2 earnings season is finally wrapping up, and for the most part, results have been strong across the board. In fact, we’ve seen broad-based growth reaching the double digit level for the second quarter in a row, an abundance of earnings surprises, and favorable trends on the revisions front.At this point, well over 90% of the S&P 500 members have reported their latest results, but there are still several marquee reports to anticipate. Indeed, the upcoming week will include a handful of market favorites and bellwether brands, meaning that investors will need to be paying attention.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week—one of the last busy weeks of the earnings season—and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of August 21:·         Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report)) – August 22 – After Market CloseSalesforce, a cloud computing giant and global leader in customer relations solutions, is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on August 22. While currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments might prove to be challenges, Salesforce remains a dominant industry force with diverse cloud offerings and strong client satisfaction.Heading into its report, Salesforce currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, surprise prediction is difficult; however, the stock does sport an “A” grade for growth, and investors should be pleased with the company’s year-over-year comparisons this quarter. According to our current consensus estimates, Salesforce is expected to report EPS growth of 18.3% and sales growth of 23.5% for its latest fiscal period. ·         HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report)) – August 23 – After Market CloseA result of the 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company into two publicly traded entities, HP Inc. is focused on the brand’s PC and printing products and services. The company is scheduled to post its third-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes on August 23. While the glory days of the PC are long gone, HP’s restructuring initiatives are finally starting to pay off, and its stock has been steadily rising all year.As we approach HP’s report date, the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While its Earnings ESP is at 0.00%, the company does have an “A” grade for Value, which is a bit of a rarity in today’s tech world. HP has also been able to post five-straight quarters of shipment growth, and if it can continue that momentum, it could be another solid report from the legacy PC brand. ·         Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report)) – August 24 – After Market CloseUlta, the nation’s largest beauty retailer, will release its second-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on August 24. A long-time beacon of hope in the struggling retail industry, Ulta has slumped significantly since its last report. Still, the company has a strong earnings surprise track record and holds exciting growth prospects.However, with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.69%, it’s clear that analyst sentiment is not strong heading into the report. Current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 24.2% and sales growth of 20.4% this quarter, and investors should keep their eye on the company’s online and same-store sales figures after the results are in. ·         Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report)) – August 24 – After Market CloseBroadcom, a key supplier for Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), will report its third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on August 24. Despite rumors of an iPhone 8 delay, this semiconductor maker has soared more than 43% year-to-date and is looking to add to its streak of 12-straight earnings beats.Broadcom is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 41.2% and sales growth of 32.6% this quarter, and it will be interesting to note if the company reveals any additional info about the production schedule for the upcoming iPhone.Of course, these are just a few of the nearly two-hundred companies that are expected to report next week. However, these major announcements should provide investors with a better sense of how earnings season is wrapping up across the board.

2689,ULTA,"On Wednesday, shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report) are falling, down about 3.5% in midday trading after rumors are floating about that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is considering a partnership with high-end beauty e-commerce site Violet Grey.Similar to Ulta and its key rival Sephora, Violet Grey is a multi-platform beauty business that is comprised of a website, a digital magazine, and brick-and-mortar store located on Melrose Place in Los Angeles. But what makes the company stand out is its focus on curation.Founder Cassandra Huysentruyt Grey and her team have collaborated with top makeup artists and skincare experts to curate the “best of the best” when it comes to beauty products, as well as essential beauty tips, tricks, and inspiration. Grey is inspired by the glamour of Hollywood, and the brands on the company’s website reflect this: Tom Ford, Chanel, Dior, La Prairie, Charlotte Tillbury, among many others.The beauty industry has long been considered the one retail area that is “Amazon-immune.” With many beauty products, especially makeup, customers still feel the need to go to a physical store to test those products out before they make any new purchases.Investors, however, may just be overreacting. BMO Capital analyst Shannon Coyne wants us to remember that one, the deal is not set in stone and two, there is very little overlap between the brands that Ulta and Violet Grey carry. This, here, is important. While Ulta does carry some luxury beauty products, the company is more known for their mid-level, department store, and drugstore brands, like Benefit and Clinique. The potential Amazon-Violet Grey partnership would hurt Sephora more, which carries many of the same brands as Violet Grey does.Coyne also points towards Ulta’s incredibly popular loyalty program, high-performing website, and mobile app, noting that these three divisions will likely “provide cover” should Amazon decide to enter the beauty market.Rumors of Amazon becoming a viable beauty threat began in earnest about a month ago, and shares of Ulta have dropped about 14% since then. This is on top of all the other Amazon news, from scooping up Whole Foods Market  to selling Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) product on its website. ULTA is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and is set to report its next quarterly earnings on August 24 after the bell.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2690,ULTA,"In an effort to make shopping experience customer friendly, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) is now accepting Apple Pay at all its stores in the U.S. The company’s credit card will also be available on Apple Pay, allowing customers to earn reward points through its loyalty program.Further, the company stated that Apple Pay will function with iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE and Apple Watch in its stores. J. C. Penney chief information officer, Therace Risch said “With Apple Pay at JCPenney, we`re able to offer a faster, more seamless check out process by allowing our customers to pay for their purchases by simply holding their iPhone or Apple Watch near a point-of-sale terminal, rather than inserting a chip card.”Moreover, recently J. C. Penney has enhanced the loyalty program to lure more customers and ramp up sales performance. Notably, the program was introduced for the first time in 2008. Per the new reward program, every customer will get $10 reward for every 200 points earned. Further, there is no cap for receiving the reward of $10 per month. For all active J. C. Penney customers any leftover points will rollover from one month to next month instead of expiring. Meanwhile, J. C. Penney credit cardmembers will get one point for each dollar spent.In an era of challenging retail landscape, most of the retailers are using loyalty program as a tool to attract and retain existing customers. Retailers such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)    and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) have 24.5 million and 30 million, active customers under their own loyalty program, respectively. Ulta’s 24.5 million active customers garner above 80% of the company’s sales. We believe J. C. Penney’s enhanced loyalty program will help attract more customers.Stock PerformanceJ. C. Penney shares, which shares space with Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past six months. However, the shares recently took a sharp “U” turn following the company’s improved sales performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  Moreover, the company announced that it expects to post substantial improvement in the top line in the second quarter in comparison with the first quarter. In the past one month, the stock has advanced over 9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.6%.J. C. Penney currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2691,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report), a leading beauty retailer in the United States, is slated to announce second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Aug 24. In the preceding quarter, it came up with a positive earnings surprise of 6.7%.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?Investors are keen on finding out whether Ulta Beauty will be able to continue its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.78, reflecting a 24.1% growth year over year. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.29 billion, reflecting an increase of 20.4% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 6.4%, while the industry dipped 1.4%.Factors at PlayUlta Beauty is lately troubled due to a slowing U.S. beauty market, which has become challenging since January. The mass market and department stores have been put under pressure, which remains a concern for Ulta Beauty. Moreover, the company remains on the backfoot due to limited global brand awareness, alongside challenges related to cheaper alternatives and changing consumer preference.However, we commend Ulta Beauty’s splendid surprise history. The company has been gaining from constant merchandise innovations, solid marketing initiatives, outstanding e-Commerce improvement and continued progress at the salon operations. Notably, the company recorded a 70.9% growth in e-Commerce sales in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Further, the company’s raised fiscal 2017 view bodes well.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. American Eagle has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.78 per share. Further, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

2692,ULTA,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) looks good on the back of its splendid surprise history, robust marketing initiatives and solid e-Commerce as well as omni-channel focus. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock boasts a VGM Score of “B”, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 20.4%, which also highlights its inherent potential. Let’s delve deep to find out more.Growth InitiativesBeing a leading beauty retailer, Ulta Beauty has created a niche market based on the products it offers. It features prestigious and discounted brands as well as offers salon products and services under one roof. Going forward, the company remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings and improving store traffic with superior customer services.Notably, the company added 69 new brands and executed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores in fiscal 2016. In addition to its portfolio of prestige brands, the beauty retailer is on track with the roll out of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand in its stores, and expanding it to about 100 stores by the end of fiscal 2017. Furthermore, management expects to enhance its services by offering the MAC makeup services at all its stores, where the brand is featured.Meanwhile, Ulta Beauty remains well on track backed by the expansion of its store base. While the company had been opening stores in suburban regions, given the advantage of lower rents and leaner competition, it is now ready to explore urban markets as evident from its recent plans to open about five stores in urban locations.It is to be noted that Ulta Beauty is known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. While the key players in the retail industry are struggling due to rising competition from online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Ulta Beauty has managed to grow both e-Commerce and in-store sales. Evidently, it registered whopping 70.9% growth in e-Commerce sales in first-quarter fiscal 2017, which also marked its highest ever quarterly growth since 2014.Sturdy PerformanceBacked by its robust strategies, Ulta Beauty has been delivering better-than-expected top-line and bottom-line results consistently for over three years.  In fact, the company maintained this robust trend in first-quarter fiscal 2017 as well, which marked its 14th straight quarter of earnings and sales beat.In the fiscal first quarter, results were driven by constant merchandise innovations and marketing initiatives, along with outstanding e-Commerce improvement and continued progress at the company’s salon operations. Consequently, management raised its comparable store sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. Currently, the company envisions earnings per share growth to come in mid-twenties percentage band, up from low-twenties percentage range, guided earlier.Moreover, earnings for the fiscal second quarter are projected in the range of $1.72–$1.77 per share compared with $1.43 delivered in second-quarter fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate, which has been stable in the last 30 days, is currently pegged at $8.28 and $1.78 for fiscal 2017 and the fiscal second quarter, respectively.The company’s strategic initiatives and solid performance are well reflected in its share price movement. Shares of Ulta Beauty have inched up 1.5% year to date against the Zacks categorized Retail – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 10.5%.Ulta Beauty Vs IndustryBottom LineWhile the company’s limited global brand awareness, challenges related to cheaper alternatives and changing consumer preference remain major concerns, we believe Ulta Beauty can easily overcome these headwinds on the back of its robust growth strategies.Meanwhile, you may have a look at another top-ranked stock in the same industry that is Barnes & Noble, Inc. . Barnes & Noble has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10% and currently carries the same Zacks Rank as Ulta Beauty. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2693,ULTA,"Shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report) rose 2% in morning trading on Friday after Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) upgraded the company from “neutral” to “buy.” Goldman Sachs also added the company to its Conviction Buy List.Analyst Matthew Fassler believes that Ulta has a positive standing after its recent selloff and its “sector-leading” same-store sales growth. Its target price of $310 represents a potential upside of 20% from the stock’s previous closing price.Ulta stock has been hit recently based on fears that department stores discounting cosmetics and competition from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) would hurt its sales.Fassler, however, does not believe Amazon will hurt Ulta in the near future. “We see AMZN as a potent competitor, but do not believe that its shopping options are comparable to ULTA’s at this time.” “In the midst of focus on the promotional backdrop, we note our thesis on ULTA has always been predicted on location (convenient), assortment (mass + prestige), and service (low-pressure vs. commission), not on price,” Fassler wrote in an analyst note.Goldman analysts “expect continued shared gains, reflecting incremental sales captured from department stores, upside from the rollout of new brands and boutiques, and growth in Ulta’s membership program, also a powerful source of valuable data.”This follows news that Goldman Sachs has also upgraded Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) today. Fassler said that Wal-Mart is prepared to “simultaneously sidestep the [Amazon] juggernaut” with the increasing demands of e-commerce and technology spending.It seems that Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods  last month may not hurt retailers and supermarket stocks as much as analysts previously thought. ULTA remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with a VGM score of ‘A.’ The company is set to release its next quarterly earnings on August 24 after the bell.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2694,ULTA,"Retail REIT, Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) announced the groundbreaking at Dania Pointe’s Phase 1 retail part. Encouragingly, this project in Southern Broward County, FL, has grabbed much attention and its Phase 1 is already around 80% preleased to a number of national and regional retailers.Slated to open for the 2018 holiday season, Phase 1 consists of 300,000 square feet of retail space. It will enjoy presence of popular brands like TJ Maxx of The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report), Hobby Lobby, BrandsMart, as well as several restaurants.The move is a solid step toward the realization of the broader mixed-used project – Dania Pointe. Upon completion, Dania Pointe will become an open-air lifestyle community, with around 1 million square feet of retail and restaurants space, complemented by up to 500,000 square feet of Class A office space, 1,000 luxury rental apartments and condominiums, and two signature hotels.Situated just next to I-95, this property will serve as the central location for residents going north and south on I-95, as well as east and west on I-595. Moreover, it is situated less than 10 minutes from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades. Also, the site is only 20 minutes from upscale communities of Weston and Plantation to the west, Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach to the north, and Hollywood and North Miami Beach to the south. This makes the property easily accessible to tourists and tri-county residents.Mixed-use DevelopmentsNotably, mixed-use developments have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density. These developments bring down the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable the companies to grab the attention of people, who prefer to live, work and play in the same area – a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U.S.In addition to Kimco, Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) is exploring the positives of mixed-use developments. The company announced a new mixed-use ground-up development – Mellody Farm – in Vernon Hills, IL, in Apr 2017.In ConclusionKimco’s premium properties in high-growth areas, presence of well-capitalized retailers in its tenant roster, investments in high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers, and shedding of non-core assets augur well for growth. However, rising online sales, store closures, tenant bankruptcy and earnings dilution, led by high disposition activity, remain causes of concern.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Kimco underperformed the industry it belongs to. During this time frame, shares of the company descended 18.6%, whereas the industry incurred a loss of 4.0%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2695,ULTA,"(0:20) – New Rules for the S&P 500: Why is This Important?(1:45) - SNAP Gets Barred From the S&P 500(4:00) – Impact on Other Companies and IPOs(5:30) - Ulta Compared to Snapchat: Why Indexes Matter(7:20) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comAfter an IPO, one of the big steps for a company is its inclusion in major market indexes, such as the S&P 500. Getting added to a benchmark puts a company in focus, and it can have a decent impact on the actual stock too. That is because it basically results in forced buying of stocks, as funds tracking the indexes have no choice but to buy those that have been added, and remove those that have been ejected out of a benchmark.While you might think this is a small detail, more than three trillion dollars are in passive investments these days, and SPY alone has more than a quarter trillion dollars in assets. Add in the other two major ETFs tracking the S&P 500—VOO and IVV—and you are approaching half a trillion dollars that is directly based on this single benchmark, and that doesn’t even include mutual funds). With these kinds of numbers, you can see why this might be a big deal to a company, and why it can definitely help to reduce supply of a given stock (and thus have a positive impact on the price).But getting into indexes is by no means a guarantee, as many index providers have criteria for including firms into their benchmarks. This can include trading levels, size, location of headquarters, and now, can include share class structure too.This Week’s Podcast TopicIn today’s podcast, we take a closer look at this issue of multiple share classes and how some companies in particular might be impacted by the rules. Snapchat’s parent Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) is especially in focus due to these rules, as the company’s multiple share classes—and issuance of non-voting shares to the public—is preventing the company from ascending to the S&P 500, among other benchmarks.Thus, SNAP will not see the benefit from the forced index buying that many of its peers do. This is actually a huge deal, at least if we look to similarly-sized companies as a guide.Ulta SNAP is relatively comparable to Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), at least in terms of market cap. Plus, both are often considered growth stocks, so it is a decent enough proxy.For ULTA, the company makes up roughly seven basis points of the fund. That doesn’t sound like a lot—and it certainly isn’t compared to the blue chip giants out there—you have to remember how much money is in SPY and similar funds. Since there is such an enormous pool of money, SPY ends up owning about one percent of all the ULTA shares (according to Morningstar).But that is just SPY, there are plenty of other funds out there and the top 20 holding funds (according to Morningstar) account for more than a quarter of all the Ulta shares! Obviously, this is a huge percentage, but it doesn’t even scratch the surface of the fund and index impact on the company.And while SNAP won’t miss out on everything, it does seem doomed to miss out on many of the major indexes from not just S&P, but FTSE Russell as well. This is definitely something for investors to consider, and it could have repercussions for others in the market too.   Other FactorsInvestors should note that some of the more famous multi-share class companies, such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), will not be impacted by these new rules, as they will be grandfathered in. However, new companies like Snap or the three share class Blue Apron could be in trouble.Make sure to listen to today’s podcast for more information about this issue, and why it could have ramifications for plenty of tech companies and IPOs down the line too. Many aren’t going to want to miss out on this gigantic pool of money, and it may force some positive changes as a result.Bottom LineBut what do you think about SNAP and the indexes?

Isn’t the rally in the shares already done? Aren’t you too late if you’re buying on the high?What to Look for With Momentum StocksDave is Zacks Momentum specialist so he knows all about buying stocks on their highs.He looks for these 2 scenarios:1.       A paradigm shift in the story. This could be that a company announces an acquisition, it lands a new major client, its drug trial is a success, or business picks up in an overseas market. Look for something that has changed in that company’s business.2.       A paradigm shift with investors. This results from investors becoming more comfortable investing in the space even though the numbers remain the same. An example would be investors figuring out that all brick and mortar stores really aren’t going to be Amazoned.Momentum buying isn’t just about the chart. It’s also about the underlying story, especially with earnings.Investors and traders have to examine both parts to determine whether they should jump in.5 Stocks to Buy on Their Highs1.       OraSure Technologies (OSUR  -  Free Report) is up 117% year-to-date.
