""Our methodology revolves around a lot of qualitative work. There is no more important factor in our qualitative assessment than the assessment of management.""The fund's low turnover has been integral to its success. ""If we are careful and circumspect about a purchase, we shouldn't have high turnover,"" Puglia said of Blue Chip Growth's 32% turnover ratio. ""We've typically had turnover that has been about one-third of the large-cap growth group average.""Puglia and his team scrutinize the valuations of prospective holdings.

189,ALK,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance Report
"
190,ALK,"The $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.
"
191,ALK,"The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
192,ALK,"That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.
"
193,ALK,"Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.
"
194,ALK,"Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.
"
195,ALK,"And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.
"
196,ALK,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
197,ALK,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
198,ALK,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
199,ALK,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
200,ALK,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
201,ALK,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
202,ALK,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
203,ALK,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
204,ALK,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
205,ALK,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
206,ALK,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
207,ALK,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
208,ALK,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
209,ALK,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.
"
210,ALK,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
211,ALK,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
212,ALK,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
213,ALK,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
214,ALK,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
215,ALK,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
216,ALK,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
217,ALK,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
218,ALK,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
219,ALK,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
220,ALK,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
221,ALK,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
222,ALK,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
223,ALK,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
224,ALK,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
225,ALK,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
226,ALK,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
227,ALK,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
228,ALK,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?
"
229,ALK,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.
"
230,ALK,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
231,ALK,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
232,ALK,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
233,ALK,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
234,ALK,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
235,ALK,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
236,ALK,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
237,ALK,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
238,ALK,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
239,ALK,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
240,ALK,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
241,ALK,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
242,ALK,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
243,ALK,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
244,ALK,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
245,ALK,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
246,ALK,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
247,ALK,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
248,ALK,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
249,ALK,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter.

261,ALK,"Microsoft (MSFT) stock surged to an all-time high Friday in heavy trading, a day after it posted much better-than-expected September quarter results.Microsoft soared as much as 12.6% intraday to 54.07 on the stock market today, eclipsing its dot-com era peak of 53.98 in December 1999. Shares closed up 10.1% at 52.87.Late Thursday, Microsoft said it earned 67 cents a share excluding items on adjusted sales of $21.66 billion for its fiscal first quarter of 2016. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Microsoft to earn 59 cents a share on sales of $21.03 billion for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30. On a year-over-year basis, EPS rose 3% while sales fell 7%.For the December quarter, Microsoft expects sales of $25.1 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. That edges just above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $25.08 billion, down 5% year over year. Microsoft did not provide EPS guidance, but analysts have been modeling for it to earn 72 cents a share, up 1%.Microsoft demonstrated ""continued progress on the transitional journey to the cloud (and way past the PC)"" in Q1, UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research note Thursday. He reiterated his buy rating on Microsoft stock and raised his price target to 56 from 52.""Microsoft shares have had a tough time breaking through the $50 level on previous attempts, but we think the transitional pieces of this story are really starting to align and showcase a more innovative and focused company than previous iterations,"" he said.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle was enthused by the fact that Microsoft guided current quarter results above expectations for the first time in several quarters. He rates Microsoft stock as overweight with a price target of 55.Here are five key takeaways from Microsoft's fiscal Q1 report:1. Cloud Transition Gaining MomentumMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company is making progress in its shift to Internet cloud computing from desktop computing.Microsoft added about 3 million new consumer subscribers to its Office 365 cloud-based productivity software. It ended the quarter with 18.2 million consumer subscribers to Office 365.Commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million, with nearly 60% using premium services, Nadella said.""We're making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion,"" Nadella said on a conference call with analysts. ""The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity, and the speed at which customers are adopting our services.""Microsoft has reached an inflection point in its Office business, Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow said in a research report Friday. Recurring subscription revenue from Office 365 last quarter more than offset the impact of customers transitioning from licensed software, he said.The lifetime revenue and operating profit of Office 365 likely will be ""meaningfully higher"" than the traditional license model, he said.Winslow maintained his outperform rating on Microsoft and raised his price target to 60 from 55.2. Microsoft vs. Amazon Cloud BattleThe enterprise cloud platform market has boiled down to two primary competitors: Microsoft and Amazon.com (AMZN), Nadella said.""While many companies are developing commercial cloud offerings, there are really only two driving enterprise cloud platform innovation at massive scale: Amazon and Microsoft,"" he said. ""We push each other, and we each have a unique approach.""Microsoft is taking a hybrid approach that combines corporate servers with cloud computing services. It has attracted such customers as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Jet.com and Alaska Air Group (ALK).Microsoft Azure revenue and compute usage has more than doubled year over year, Nadella said.The battle for public cloud infrastructure is clearly ""a two-horse race between Microsoft and Amazon,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a report Friday. He said both companies can be ""very profitable at scale.""MacMillan reiterated his outperform rating on Microsoft stock and upped his price target to 57 from 54.Microsoft has moved to the cloud quicker and more successfully than other mature tech companies, FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research report Friday. He kept his outperform rating on Microsoft stock and increased his price target to 60 from 53 ""to reflect a stronger cloud trajectory and better free-cash-flow growth.""3. Bing Search Business ProfitableMicrosoft's Bing search engine finally reached profitability during the September quarter, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood announced on the call. Microsoft's Internet search business generated more than $1 billion in revenue in fiscal Q1.""We expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the year,"" she said.Bing's share of the U.S. market is now up to 20.7%, a distant second to Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. Bing's advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide in Q1, helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions, Nadella said. Cortana is Microsoft's answer to Apple's (AAPL) Siri personal digital assistant.4. PC Hardware Partnerships EmphasizedNadella made an effort to appease Microsoft's Windows PC hardware partners when he discussed the company's own hardware initiatives, such as the new Surface Book notebook. Microsoft ruffled feathers when it introduced the Surface Book, which competes with products from Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Dell.He referred to Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 as ""premium devices"" that are coming to market along with those of ""OEM partners.""""We are also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners — the widest range ever for this holiday,"" Nadella said.5. Surface Sales Down Before RefreshSales of Microsoft's Surface tablets and convertibles dipped in the September quarter ahead of the company's product refresh. Microsoft announced its new Surface devices on Oct. 6.Surface sales faced tough comparisons to the same quarter last year when the Surface Pro 3 was fresh on the market.Surface sales totaled $672 million in fiscal Q1, compared with $908 million in the September quarter last year.Some Analysts Not ImpressedNot all analysts were bullish on Microsoft post-earnings.Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini maintained her sell rating on Microsoft, but raised her price target to 45 from 40.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci kept his underperform rating on Microsoft stock, but increased his price target to 39 from 37.Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated his market perform rating, but upped his price target to 53 from 50. Microsoft posted a ""good all-around"" Q1, but the stock is fairly valued at the current level, he said.

381,ALK,"Airlines have been raising capacity in the second quarter but industry experts say carriers have learned from past expansion missteps. S&P Capital analyst Jim Corridore said in a report Tuesday that he expects a record profitable year for airlines in 2015 on revenue growth and lower oil prices.
"
382,ALK,"He said fare increases, fewer fare discounts and more business travelers helped revenue growth in the first half of the year, even as capacity increased.Last week American Airlines (AAL) reported an increase in Q2 capacity and profit that topped analyst estimates. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reported Q2 earnings above Wall Street estimates as capacity increased 30%. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) Q2 earnings and revenue beat estimates while the carrier's domestic capacity rose 6%. Alaska Air (ALK) boosted flights by 11% out of its home airport in Seattle this spring. Southwest (LUV) is boosting flights out of Dallas.On Tuesday, Alaska said traffic rose 6.4% last month, with capacity up 6.9% vs. a year ago. Load factor fell 0.4 point to 88.1%.Delta said July consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 3% on pressure from foreign exchange, lower surcharges in international markets and continued yield pressure in domestic markets.Revenue passenger miles rose 4.7% last month, and available seat miles, a measure of capacity, grew 4.2%.The increases in capacity come at a time when airlines say they are trying not to let growth spiral out of control and hurt fares. At the same time, the Justice Department is looking into whether airlines conspired to constrain capacity and keep fares high.Corridore says capacity increases shouldn't worry investors.Lower oil prices are also helping airlines post profits this year. The report said the U.S. airline industry uses 19 billion to 20 billion gallons of jet fuel each year. Oil prices are down nearly 50% vs. a year ago. Delta has its own refinery to help curb fuel prices even further.Unbundling ticket prices has also helped airlines boost revenue as travelers now have to pay extra for food or a checked bag.By late morning, Delta shares edged up 0.3% in the stock market today. American shares were up 0.9%. Spirit shares jumped 3.1% to 61.40. Alaska Air shares rose 2.2% to 79.43. Southwest shares were flat.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

The airline also announced increases in traffic and capacity in July.A new U.S. News & World Report ranked the Seattle-based carrier as the top airline for rewards. The company has partnerships with American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), giving travelers more ways to accrue miles even if they don't always fly Alaska directly. American came in at No.2 and Southwest (LUV) at No.3.Delta came in near the bottom along with United Continental (UAL).Alaska Air shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market today. American shares rose 2.5% to 42.74. Southwest shares were up 1% to 37.93.Rewards such as upgrades to first class and free flights are becoming harder to get for infrequent fliers,according to the report, and airlines have made it harder to take advantage of rewards with blackout dates and other travel restrictions, requiring more miles for perks.Credit cards from Capital One Financial (COF) and Citigroup (C)offer ways to help get more travel miles with purchases.Also Tuesday, Alaska said traffic rose 6.4% last month, with capacity up 6.9% vs. a year ago. Load factor fell 0.4 point to 88.1%.Delta said July consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 3% on pressure from foreign exchange, lower surcharges in international markets and continued yield pressure in domestic markets.Revenue passenger miles rose 4.7% last month, and available seat miles, a measure of capacity, was up 4.2%.Delta shares ended the day up 1.3% to 46.34.Meanwhile, United CFO John Rainey stepped down Tuesday to become the CFO for PayPal (PYPL), replacing Patrick Dupuis, who was in that position for five years.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

"
567,ALK,"But there's a lot more to it than that.

575,ALK,"While Alaska Air was bought three separate times, the average cost basis ended up just 53 cents higher than the first buy. A position was built while the stock was still in a buy range, too. Remember, never chase a stock when it moves 5% past a buy point.

Alaska Airlines has been adding flights to Hawaii and the eastern U.S. and said that it planned to boost nonstop flights out of Seattle by 11% by this spring.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Alaska to report a 72% jump in earnings to $1.10 per share. Revenue is seen rising 3.9% to $1.27 billion.Hawaiian Holdings (HA), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, is expected to report a 33-cent per-share profit vs. a 2-cent per-share loss in the year-ago quarter, with revenue rising nearly 2% to $534.7 million.In January, Hawaiian Airlines warned Q1 operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) would fall by 3.5% to 6.5% vs. a year earlier, after climbing 6.1% in Q4.The airline cited the stronger dollar and lower fuel surcharges on some of its international routes, including South Korea and Japan.The stronger dollar hit Hawaiian's tickets to Asian customers, but the company said that demand for travel to Hawaii is still strong and that it could add more flights.According to the annual Airline Quality Rating report, Hawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Virgin America (VA) were the only airlines that saw improved scores vs. a year earlier on issues such as on-time performance, lost bags and customer complaints.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

"
842,ALK,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

876,ALK,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, most stocks should advance. But investors should look for the true market leaders, such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD's Screen of the Day, Bolting RS Lines, separates the wheat from the chaff. It focuses on top-rated companies whose relative strength lines are rising to new highs. A rising RS line means the stock is outpacing the benchmark S&P; 500 index.Skyworks has advanced for the past six sessions, rising 2% Monday to a new closing high of 82.48 on the stock market today. Even more impressive, Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth, including last week's Q1 2015 gain of 88%. Sales growth has picked up for four straight quarters.Skyworks shares have been on a tear since finding support just above its 200-day moving average on Oct. 10. Its RS line has been hitting new highs since early November.Skyworks makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy GS5 as well as many other wireless devices and in other industries. Apple reports earnings Tuesday night, with analysts raising iPhone 6 sales targets.Centene (CNC) is a leading health insurer, focusing on Medicaid programs. It's benefited from the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion as well as winning more state Medicaid contracts.Centene said Monday it will buy Oregon-based Agate Resources , which provides some Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and ObamaCare exchange coverage in the state.Q4 earnings likely doubled (101%) in Centene's next report due in early February, accelerating from the prior quarter's 37% advance. Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK). Alaska is one of three airline stocks on the Bolting RS Lines screen, along with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

The Nasdaq kept to a fractional loss, buffered by Apple's (AAPL) 1% advance.Volume was soft, down 8% on the Nasdaq and 25% lower on the NYSE.Oil-related issues were taking a beating in early action in the stock market today as the price of the U.S. crude benchmark West Texas intermediate fell 4%, back below $47 a barrel.The drag was strong enough to reverse premarket gains made by Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) after their fourth-quarter earnings reports. Halliburton fell 2% and Schlumberger was down 3% at the start of trade.Weak oil prices were also key to a positive Q4 report from Delta Air Lines (DAL), which launched the airlines group to the head of early trade.

"
920,ALK,"At the start of the year, the airline industry was ranked 63rd out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, while gold and silver miners were down at No. 189.Today, the airline industry has risen to 15th amid falling fuel prices and an improving economy. But miners remain near the bottom amid weak commodities prices.The 20-stock airline group is up 67% this year, paced by leaders Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Airlines (ALK). In contrast, the 71-stock gold, silver and gem mining group is up 4%.The lesson? Don't buy stocks in beaten-down industry groups on the expectation that a rebound is just around the corner. Instead, look for the leading stocks in strong — and preferably rising — industry groups, as they are the most likely to provide the best returns.IBD helps investors find stocks with the greatest potential for capital gains. Columns such as the Big Picture, Sector Leaders Review and Stock Spotlight focus on leading stocks. Each features a chart that shows the stock's status — whether in buying range, extended or in a base.The charts, as well as the sector tables, give key ratings for each stock, such as the Composite Rating, Earnings Per Share Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating.Furthermore, check the industry tables in IBD each day to find the highest-rated groups. You want to select the stocks with the highest ratings from the top 40 industries, as they're the most likely to possess superior fundamentals. They should have stellar profit and sales growth, high return on equity and wide profit margins.Such stocks typically boast innovative products and services that are either unique or far superior to what the competition offers.In addition, insist on solid chart patterns, and make sure the shares are in demand by mutual funds and other big investors.""The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir,"" wrote IBD founder William O'Neil in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""By contrast, a lagging group — and its constituent stocks — can take a long time to turn around. That's why it's dangerous to buy on the way down, as factors behind the decline can persist for months or even years.Often, it takes disruptive new technologies or business models to revive an industry. Discount airlines have upset old business models, fostering innovation and mergers that have helped the industry to rebound from years of falling profits.Spirit Airlines has succeeded by offering cut-rate fares while charging customers fees for services that used to be free. The stock, which has an industry-leading 98 Composite Rating, has tripled this year.Richmont Mines' (RIC) 87 Composite Rating is the highest in the mining group. The stock has tripled this year, but it's still low-priced and thinly traded, which makes it exceptionally risky. Also, many of its other fundamental measures are weak. Furthermore, most of the mining group's institutional-quality stocks have done poorly.As always, it's important to make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend before buying any stock. The stocks that break out of bases first in the early stages of a new uptrend tend to enjoy the biggest gains.

944,ALK,"Following a brief dip in October tied to the Ebola scare, airline stocks are trading at their highest point in years as the industry benefits from cheap oil prices and a growing U.S. economy.
"
945,ALK,"One of the biggest gainers in recent weeks is Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the low-cost carrier that has made a name for itself by providing a bare-bones flying option for budget-conscious travelers.
"
946,ALK,"Its shares have risen nearly 60% since Oct. 13, when IBD's Transportation-Airline group hit an eight-month low as investors worried that a spreading Ebola outbreak might curb air travel.
"
947,ALK,"Spirit's stock gain compares favorably with the performance of other airlines highly rated by IBD, such asSouthwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).
"
948,ALK,"Shares of Spirit got a lift on Oct. 28, rising 7% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views.
"
949,ALK,"""We're very pleased with how the market is responding to our track record and growth story,"" Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza told IBD. ""People like our return on investment and growth profile.""
"
950,ALK,"That track record includes years of solid profits despite the ups and downs of the air travel industry. More recently, the airline has run off seven straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and EPS growth.
"
951,ALK,"Baldanza's Bonanza
"
952,ALK,"Spirit has an all-Airbus (EADSY) fleet of 60 narrow-body planes and operates more than 280 daily flights going to more than 55 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.
"
953,ALK,"The recipe for success is pretty simple, Baldanza says. Spirit offers cut-rate fares — about 40% lower than other airlines on average, according to Department of Transportation data — to travelers who value cost savings over all else.
"
954,ALK,"Those travelers represent the majority of the airline market, according to evaluations Spirit conducted.
"
955,ALK,"""Our evaluations found that when you ask customers how they pick an airline, more than half say they just want the lowest price,"" Baldanza said. ""That's more important than other features such as more leg room or in-flight entertainment.""
"
956,ALK,"To reach those customers, Spirit offers a basic ""bare fare"" option that includes a seat and one piece of carry-on luggage. If you want anything else — even a beverage — it costs extra.
"
957,ALK,"The company caters to passengers who order and pay for their own tickets, which basically means leisure and small-business travelers. Business-class travelers who work for corporations with large travel budgets are not the target demographic.
"
958,ALK,"Baldanza notes that what you'll find on a Spirit flight reflects the low fare.
"
959,ALK,"""If you are paying for the ticket yourself, you tend to be more realistic,"" he said. ""Our planes don't have as much leg room as other airlines, our seats don't recline, we tend to only make one or two flights a day from many markets.""
"
960,ALK,"That's a compromise, he concedes. ""But what you get is the absolute lowest total price. That's why our planes are very full and why we continue to grow very profitably.""
"
961,ALK,"Spirit keeps its fares low by keeping its own costs low, Baldanza says. ""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""
"
962,ALK,"In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.
"
963,ALK,"Most Profitable Airline?
"
964,ALK,"In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.
"
965,ALK,"Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.
"
966,ALK,"Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.
"
967,ALK,"""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.
"
968,ALK,"Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.
"
969,ALK,"Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.
"
970,ALK,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.
"
971,ALK,"Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""
"
972,ALK,"CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry. ""When somebody creates a better mousetrap, people copy it,"" he said.
"
973,ALK,"Baldanza points to Europe, where about 20% of travelers fly on carriers similar to Spirit, including Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). In contrast, Spirit carries just under 2% of the total U.S. air passenger traffic.
"
974,ALK,"""We don't see anybody doing what we are doing yet, though over time we expect they will,"" Baldanza said.
"
975,ALK,"Meanwhile, Spirit continues to expand its operations.
"
976,ALK,"On Nov. 17, it announced plans for nonstop flights to 10 new destinations, including Tampa, Fla.; Baltimore/Washington, D.C.; and Oakland/San Francisco Bay, as well as seven locations in Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. The new flights will begin in the spring.
"
977,ALK,"Spirit also recently boosted nonstop routes, saying it will soon have a total of ten from Denver and nine from Los Angeles, in addition to its other nonstop and connecting-flight routes.

980,ALK,"Selecting stocks that have superior profit and sales growth is not the sole key to success in the market. Neither is simply buying stocks with outstanding price strength.Before you invest in a stock, make sure that it also is a favorite among the biggest investors in the market: mutual funds, investment advisors, banks and the like. This critical component is known as institutional sponsorship.Proof of heavy institutional buying is one way to confirm sponsorship, but is time-consuming to find — except at IBD.The paper's Mutual Funds and ETFs section provides instruments to help. Many of the features do double duty. They reveal top-performing funds for long-term investors and help you zero in on stocks that these strong buyers have targeted.Mutual funds are, by design, a more passive investing tool than stocks. Professional fund managers and research crews pick and time the purchases of stocks so that fund clients don't have to sweat the details.IBD narrows down the field to a list of 40 leading funds whose stock holdings carry a high average IBD Composite Rating and which have tended to outperform the S&P 500 since the index's 2009 low.The Growth Funds Leading The Market feature on the mutual funds page spotlights two of those funds each day. As is often the case in IBD, the feature makes it worth pulling out the reading glasses and diving into the fine print. The box provides a basic bio on the funds, a volatility rating and the average EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings of its stock holdings.Perhaps even more importantly, the box provides the fund's 10 largest holdings, as well as its top new buys and top sells. The daily section also provides lists of other top-performing funds, screened according to various criteria.You can delve even deeper with IBD's Mutual Fund Monthly and Quarterly Reports, usually published in the first week of each month. These features slice and dice the top-performing funds according to size, sector and type of investment. Such vital signs point to warming or cooling movement across the global economy and offer clues for whether you might want to tinker with your fund portfolio.From a stock-buying perspective, the monthly and quarterly data on stock buys and sells are pure gold mines. These data tables put a radio collar on smart money over the prior three months. Which stocks were the top funds buying, and how much?The ""Top Funds' Latest Sells"" table provides the number of funds buying vs. those selling, with a net total of sellers. If you spot one of your stocks on this list, closely monitor its chart for any key sell signals.On the buy side, some stock names will be familiar from the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 or Your Weekly Review.

1034,ALK,"While falling oil prices obviously have had a negative impact on oil and gas stocks — eight of the nine lowest rated IBD industry groups are now in that sector — declining prices also have had a ripple effect on other industries: some for the better, others not so much.
"
1035,ALK,"Following are four other industries that have seen an immediate impact from lower prices at the wellhead and gasoline pump. Three are enjoying the trend, while one of them is not.
"
1036,ALK," Airlines: Considering that fuel is one of the biggest expenses in the airline industry, it's no surprise that falling gasoline prices have been a boon to companies that make their living in the air.
"
1037,ALK,"IBD's Transportation-Airline group is trading at record highs and ranks No. 2 among 197 industries tracked. That's up from No. 116 as recently as eight weeks ago.
"
1038,ALK,"Stocks that have set multiyear highs in recent days include pretty much every airline you can think of. These include large commercial carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL) as well as discount carriers Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and regional operations like Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA).
"

"
1040,ALK,"But airline stocks weren't winners on Tuesday morning. Spirit shares plunged 15.5% after reporting November traffic figures late Monday. United fell nearly 4% intraday after reporting a traffic dip. Other carriers also retreated.
"
1041,ALK," Truckers: Similar to airlines, freight trucking companies spend a lot of money on fuel. When fuel prices fall, costs go down and margins go up.
"
1042,ALK,"IBD's Transportation-Truck ranks No. 7 of all the industries tracked and has been steadily rising for the past eight weeks. The group touched a record high on Friday and is up 23% since Oct. 13.

"
1044,ALK," Auto parts retailers: When gas prices go down, people drive more. When they drive more, they put more wear and tear on the cars. When that happens, there's a rise in demand for replacement parts, maintenance and vehicle services.
"

Any threat to oil and gas producers will likely hurt railroad companies.

The IBD 50 is a list of companies based on superior earnings, strong price performance and leadership within industries.

It cited the chest-thumping on international trade from President Donald Trump as among the factors.""The possibility that the current trade dispute between the US and its global partners could become something bigger is problematic for the industry's top line given how closely correlated it is to imports and exports of goods and services,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said in a research note dated Monday.""Furthermore,"" he continued, ""the growing trade dispute may cause US companies to reconsider their CAPEX and employment plans, which would adversely impact corporate travel.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Airlines are struggling to keep profit afloat as jet-fuel costs surge.Delta Air Lines on Tuesday said it expects second-quarter earnings per share of $1.65-$1.75, the same as its outlook last month but lower than the $1.80-$2 forecast in April. Analysts expect Delta to turn in Q2 EPS of $1.75, according to Zacks Investment Research.As for unit revenue, the much-watched gauge of passenger sales in relation to an airline's flight capacity: Delta kept the forecast for that key metric the same as well. It expects a 4%-5% uptick for the second quarter, on strong demand in both its leisure and business seating options. The company said that demand helped counterbalance a roughly 50% jump in fuel prices.Pretax margins for the second quarter are expected to come in at 13%-14%, Delta said. That's also in line with the forecast the company gave last month.Deutsche Bank cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to $1.75, from $1.95.Delta on Tuesday forecast Q2 capacity, or its overall available seats and flight coverage, to rise around 3.5%. That forecast was at the midpoint of the 3%-4% increase it projected in June.At that time, Delta said it expected to decide how to handle its flight capacity for the fall ""over the next month."" Delta said that decision would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel."" It was unclear if any action had been taken.During its first-quarter earnings call in April, Delta said it planned to pack its planes with more premium, higher-priced airfares this year. It also said it planned to ""recapture"" ever-more-expensive fuel costs with higher revenue.Delta, American and United, Linenberg said, are the most exposed to the friction between the U.S. and other parts of the world, given their vast, international networks and corporate clientele. Deutsche Bank estimated that the three carriers accounted for around 65%-70% of U.S. business travelers.He said that he favored more ""domestic-oriented"" carriers, such as Southwest Airlines (LUV), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU). Still, Linenberg lowered his price targets on those carriers amid the macroeconomic and geopolitical tension.""While we believe these stocks are likely to outperform over the next six months, we are mindful of the second order effects of a growing trade dispute, which would likely mean that all US airline stocks are at risk of collateral damage,"" he wrote.Shares of Delta slipped 2.3% in the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels in nearly five months.American Airlines stock fell 1.6%, while United lost 1.1%. Shares of Southwest Airlines, which has tapered its capacity growth for this year, edged down 2 cents after briefly reclaiming its 50-day line.

The Trump Administration's order blocking an attempted takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore based Broadcom (AVGO) sent Qualcomm sprawling and Broadcom down 0.5%. The news initially sent Intel (INTC) up 4%, but gains fizzled to 0.2% by the close. News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower. Still, insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 2% to lead the Dow after naming Andrew Witty, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) former chief executive, to head Optum health-services — the company's pharmacy benefits manager.  The positioning of a high-profile CEO to head the company stirred speculation that UntiedHealth could be considering a spin off.

It benefited from 3M (MMM), which leapt nearly 3% to an all-time high after the company's earnings and sales topped views. Megacap 3M also raised its quarterly dividend and announced plans to increase investments this year.Another contributor to the Dow was Caterpillar (CAT), which reversed higher. The heavy-equipment maker breezed past sales and profit expectations. The stock also is near a record high. United Technologies (UTX), which reported earnings Wednesday, and Boeing (BA) also were outperforming.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were up 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was flat.

1263,ALK,"Boeing (BA) on Tuesday announced more than $900 million in service orders with Asian airlines and other companies at the Singapore Airshow, while the jet maker was reportedly competing with Airbus (EADSY) for a massive order from the Indian airline Vistara.X The jostling comes as the aviation industry tries to tap a rapidly growing and competitive travel market in Asia and more carriers weigh options for additional long-haul flights. Those moves could pit other carriers against the likes of global airlines like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) internationally.Demand for Asia-Pacific carriers jumped 9.4% last year, as the economy expands and travelers enjoy a broader array of route options, the International Air Transport Association said last week. The region makes up a third of Airbus' new business, the company said.Vistara, an affiliate of Singapore Airlines, was negotiating with the two jet makers to buy up to $8.5 billion worth of new planes — an order likely to consist of 50 narrow-body, short-haul jets and as many as 10 wide-body jets, sources told Bloomberg.The new jets, according to the report, would allow Vistara to offer flights to areas like New York and London.For the narrow-body planes, Bloomberg said, Vistara would likely be deciding between the Airbus A321neo and Boeing's 737 Max — the companies' more fuel-efficient, single-aisle workhorses — and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A330neo for the wide-body planes.Airbus, at the airshow on Tuesday, also said it was looking ""very, very closely"" at whether it should boost production rates of its single-aisle A320s as air-travel demand jumps in nations like China and India.Shares of Boeing were up 3.7% on the stock market today, and Airbus rose 3.3%. Delta gained 1.1%, American 2.85% and United 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Meanwhile, the orders announced by Boeing were for parts, engineering and maintenance, training and professional services, and digital aviation and analytics, the company said.Among them, Royal Brunei Airlines signed an agreement for five overhead flight crew rest retrofits on 787-8 Dreamliners. The modifications, Boeing said, ""will allow the carrier to fly the 787-8 airplanes on long-haul routes, providing increased operations flexibility to the fleet and operator.""China Southern Airlines (ZNH), Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines and All Nippon Airways were among the regional airline or aviation firms that placed orders with Boeing.

Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors.

Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus.

Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views.

The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%.

China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop.

Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion.

TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines.

Along with DOJ subpoena of the mortgage unit of Lennar (LEN) and a bigger-than-expected new-home sales decline, other homebuilders also suffered notable declines.

1265,ALK,"While United Airlines' (UAL) ambitious expansion plans have raised anxieties over a coming airfare war, American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker said his company had no plans to change its own growth goals this year — ""based on what we know now.""X He also said United's plans won't change American's earnings guidance for this year, despite concerns that lower fares and more competing flights will erode profits.""Look, we'll see where people grow, we'll see where people decide to compete,"" he said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We will obviously respond where we think it makes sense, but it's always going to be around our core strategic assets.""But he said that the carrier would grow in a way that was unlikely to cause new skirmishes on fares, and that fares were ""too low for oil prices this high. Over time, you'll see it adjust.""American plans to expand flight capacity by 2.5% this year, and 3% when factoring in cancellations resulting from hurricanes in Florida and the Caribbean last year. Still, that's lower than United's plans for 4%-6% growth this year and a similar rate for next year and 2020.But analysts pressed Parker on why they should trust American's longer-term profit and growth targets, which include a minimal fleet expansion and 2018 earnings per share of $5.50-$6.50.He responded by saying ""we're not going to opine on other airlines' capacity plans,"" but that American plans to expand in areas where it has a competitive advantage.The growth, he said, would come from 1) new service to smaller cities like Panama City, Fla., and South Bend, Ind., 2) adding more frequent flights to existing cities like Stillwater, Okla., and 3) connecting those cities to new hubs.While he acknowledged that service to new markets means other carriers may lose ""a little share,"" he maintained it won't start a fare war or ""some sort of enormous competitive response."" He later added: ""Sometimes, you can get overreactions to a number.""In spite of his efforts to add nuance to American's expansion plans, shares closed down 3.2% at 53.05 on the stock market today, piling on to Wednesday's 6% dive. United fell 4.3% after plunging 11.4%, and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings earlier this month, lost 3.5% after dropping 5% yesterday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Meanwhile, travel demand and unit revenue — an important measure of an airline's operating efficiency — continue to rebound for American. The carrier forecast unit revenue growth of 2%-4%, reflecting expected continued improvement in demand for both business and leisure travel. But that forecast would mark a slowdown from the 5.6% unit-revenue gain in the fourth quarter.""Customers are responding positively to the options American offers, from international First Class to Basic Economy,"" said American Airlines President Robert Isom in a statement. ""We are far ahead of our U.S. competitors in offering Premium Economy on our international flights, which comes just as we begin to prepare for the busy summer travel season.""During the call, management said the ""premium"" section of its cabins did much of the heavy lifting in helping unit revenue to rebound internationally, as more passengers seek more comfort on longer flights over the Atlantic and Pacific. American's results over the Atlantic, where low-cost, long-haul rivals have proliferated, got better due to premium offerings and matching fares more precisely.American earned 95 cents a share in the fourth quarter, better than expectations for 92 cents. Revenue came in at $10.6 billion, compared to estimates for $10.58 billion. Operating expenses climbed 9.8%, due to a 23.5% jump in fuel costs and a 7% increase in salaries and benefits.Also Thursday, Southwest Airlines' (LUV) earnings per share of 77 cents and revenue of $5.27 billion also topped estimates. CEO Gary Kelly said ""our goal remains to achieve positive unit revenue growth in 2018, year-over-year.""The carrier said it expects 2018 capacity growth to be in the low 5% range, according to a Raymond James research note. That's in line with the carrier's earlier forecast for growth of under 5.7%.Shares retreated 3.2% after tumbling 4.7% on Wednesday.Alaska Air Group (ALK) sank 4% after it forecast a 3.5%-4.5% drop in first-quarter unit revenue.

1269,ALK,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) has a good earnings and balance-sheet profile, but its focus on domestic traffic means Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) will benefit more from a boost in business travel sparked by tax cuts, analysts said.X Meanwhile, United boosted its outlook for Q4 passenger unit revenue and now sees it coming in about flat from a year ago, driven by stronger yields and better close-in demand. Last month, the carrier predicted it would be down 2% to flat.Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded Southwest to neutral along with Alaska Air (ALK), while JetBlue (JBLU) was cut to underperform. American was upgraded to buy; Delta and United were maintained at buy.""We believe Southwest is the highest quality airline in the group with a very conservative balance sheet and low earnings volatility,"" BofA Merrill Lynch said. ""However, we expect business travel and international markets to outperform Southwest's largely domestic-oriented system in 2018.""Southwest shares closed down 2.5% at 62.38 on the stock market today for a fifth straight decline but still extended from a 59.99 buy point. Delta dipped 0.9% to 54.17, still within range of a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. United ended virtually flat but jumped 3% late, and American lost 0.1%.JetBlue, which on Tuesday also said it would add service between Florida and the Caribbean, rallied 0.9%, and Alaska fell 2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Late Tuesday, United also said December traffic grew 2.7% and capacity increased 3.7%, while load factor declined by 0.8 percentage point to 82.3%.Earlier in the day, Southwest said it still expects unit revenue to increase 1%-2%. The airline said that passenger traffic in December rose 2.6%, while its flight capacity rose 1.8% and load factor was up 0.7 percentage point to 83.3%.The monthly traffic figures come as Delta prepares to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Delta's financials have kept analysts relatively happy, but Wall Street appears likely to be more focused on cost containment this year after industry expenses rose in 2017.Southwest, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25, last week said it would give employees a $1,000 cash bonus ""to celebrate the recent passage of the tax reform legislation.""The company also said it would exercise an option to order 40 Boeing (BA) 737 MAX 8 aircraft — 15 next year and 25 in 2020. It deferred 23 737 MAX 7 orders. Southwest at the time said its capacity growth plans for 2018 remained unchanged.American Airlines and JetBlue last week also said they would give their employees $1,000 following the tax cuts, which President Trump signed into law last month.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

1271,ALK,"The I in CAN SLIM represents one of the key driving factors behind the stock market's advances and declines: the big money.XThe big money is also known as institutional investors, so the ""I"" stands for institutional sponsorship. That refers to ownership of shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and other big investors. Since their buying and selling account for the majority of trading on the stock exchanges, it's a good idea to have them on your side.""Buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""These heavyweights tend to buy thousands of shares at a time. After all, they deploy millions to billions of dollars in the market on behalf of their clients. The pros will usually buy shares in an installment-like frequency, instead of all at once, to avoid running prices up too much. So it can take weeks, or even months, for them to build a full position.Mutual funds report their portfolio holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter. Investors can access the data on the SEC's Edgar website.When researching individual stocks, always check to see if they are owned by institutions. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, available for every stock in IBD Stock Checkup, is a finger on the pulse of institutional activity. The rating ranges from A to E, with an A pointing to strong net buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks, and an E indicating recent net selling. A C is neutral, so an A or B is preferable.The proprietary rating is also available in the daily stock tables and minicharts in the weekly print issue, IBD Weekly. Another useful gauge is the number of funds buying shares — you'd ideally see an increase from quarter to quarter. Both metrics show up in the Technical Performance section of Stock Checkup, under the ""Supply And Demand"" header.MarketSmith, a premium research product of IBD, shows the number of funds owning shares over the past four quarters.Another place to spot what some highly regarded mutual funds are buying (and selling) is in IBD's Funds & Personal Finance section.

In IBD's May 7, 2014, edition, the special section noted Alaska Airlines (ALK) as one of the stocks being bought heavily by top fund managers.Shares of the airline went on to form a good double-bottom base from July to September 2014, then broke out with a 12% upward thrust during the week ended Oct. 24. The buy point was 48.35, 10 cents above the middle peak between the two lows of 41.84 and 40.69.From that late-October breakout, Alaska Air shares flew more than 80% higher to a December 2015 high of 87.17.

Institutional investors seek to find firms with exceptional earnings and sales growth, an outstanding product or service, and the highest pretax margins and return on equity in their industries. As seen in a graph on page B4 of the IBD Weekly newspaper, the price-weighted IBD 50 shows a total return of 750% from April 11, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2016, equal to an average annual gain of 16.9%.

1272,ALK,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

1275,ALK,"A price war that threatens to upend the airline industry likely began this spring, after thousands of Spirit Airlines (SAVE) passengers in May learned their flights were canceled. The low-cost airline blamed pilots, who were entangled in a pay dispute, for engaging in a ""pervasive illegal work slowdown"" — an account the pilots disputed.X Customers were furious, and a fight broke out at a Spirit counter in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. People were arrested. After passengers booked elsewhere, Spirit cut fares to try to lure them back. As it scrambled to contain the damage, United Airlines (UAL) swooped in, matching some of Spirit's prices in several of the legacy carrier's biggest, most prized airport hubs.United, American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) in years past might not have always seen no-frills, bargain-hunting customers as their own. But flush with cash, they now look to tighten their grip on the skies above the U.S. and drive out ultra-low-cost challengers, potentially limiting competition further in an industry that has already seen dramatic consolidation.The shift has prompted analysts to question if passengers have any reason left to fly airlines like Spirit if the legacy network airlines are copying their strategy — either with bare-bones, high-restriction ""basic economy"" seats or fares that cost as little as dinner and a drink or two.""I don't know that the basic fact has changed: that low costs tend to win in the airline industry,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""But this is maybe the most interesting moment in history to test that, now that the big three airlines are so successful and now that they have such good balance sheets.""IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review them.
"
1276,ALK,"Following 40 bankruptcy-riddled years, the airline industry has consolidated into four airlines that control about 80% of the U.S. market: United, American, Delta and Southwest (LUV). Such market sway has helped improve earnings, and the big airlines have vowed not to let ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) beat them on price.The carriers' path to greater market dominance will be tested in the year ahead. Costs are rising for everything from employee pay to fuel prices to the landing fees that will fund airports' efforts to add parking and transportation and renovate terminals to look more sleek or at least less depressing.The higher expenses to run an airline will threaten profits and the willingness to match bargain fares of the ultra-low-cost carriers, who face some of the same cost pressures.""If your costs are going up, it's not sustainable that you keep lowering your fares,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said of United's discounting onslaught, adding: ""I don't know that I would say (United) would back off first. I would just say that you will see fares trend higher in general.""In years past, the U.S. legacy carriers and the discounters viewed the passengers they pursued as existing in more clearly separated markets, Kaplan says. An airline like Spirit saw itself attracting a more price-sensitive bunch who might otherwise spend their money on, say, going to the movies rather than another airline, he says.Ultra-low-cost carriers generally operate with lower structural costs than their larger rivals do, meaning they can offer super-low fares more easily. Spirit tends to skimp more on seat space, allowing the carrier to cram in more seats and spread costs across more passengers. ULCCs also tend to fly point to point, without guaranteed connections, cutting down on the time — and money — spent on the ground waiting for connecting passengers.As the big three carriers rolled out basic economy, their vast networks offered an advantage on connections, even if the fare class didn't guarantee that, say, a family of four can sit together.With Spirit, you can still sit together. But when United tried to match ULCCs on fares last summer, Spirit had to back off from plans to raise fares to stay competitive with the giants. Spirit stock tanked 18% in a single day in July.""Clearly, the ULCC model is being questioned by the Street,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note following that dive.Shares of the network carriers weren't faring much better. When a bigger, higher-expense rival like United tries to emulate Spirit, United either loses more money than Spirit or makes less money.In particular, plans by low-cost Frontier Airlines to push into Denver were seen by United as a shift away from its point-to-point model and toward a more costly and complex hub-and-spoke model. In hub and spoke, passengers are routed to big airports and then put on connecting flights.""I've believed for many years that the ultra-low-cost-carrier business model can't work when a network carrier decides to compete on price,"" United President Scott Kirby said in July. ""This is the first public validation that one of the ULCCs has thrown in the towel on the point-to-point business model.""Frontier denied it was changing the way it flies. But ULCCs face tough questions about their future.Asked at a conference in September whether ULCCs were doomed when a major carrier cuts prices, Spirit CFO Ted Christie replied ""absolutely not."" He said ""rumors of the death of the ULCC model are clearly overstated"" and that people like low fares.New concerns over industry costs have since recast the debate. In October, United management unnerved investors by making cagey responses to questions about the airline's 2018 outlook.The carrier said that health care costs, pensions and airport fees were rising. But it offered no specifics, saying only that it was ""in the middle"" of mapping out 2018 costs and taking a ""very different approach"" to them.The remarks signaled that expectations set last year may be softening. Those targets included keeping nonfuel unit cost growth under 1%, producing $4.8 billion in ""earnings improvement"" by 2020, and lopping roughly $1 billion off the carrier's capital expenditures this year.Worries grew about United's ability to catch up with Delta on margins. Investors laid into United's stock, sinking it 12% in one day.""Making it worse was poor commentary on the (third-quarter earnings) call where UAL wouldn't address, even qualitatively, 2018 (unit costs),"" Wolfe Research's Keay said in a research note. ""In fact, we felt warned on it.""A week later, Alaska Air Group (ALK) shares tanked as Wall Street worried over its ability to manage costs as it brings Virgin America under its wing.  Concerns included its efforts to resolve a pilot shortage with higher pay amid rising competition.Then American got hit. Shares tumbled after it forecast greater capacity growth and higher-than-expected costs in 2018, with pay raises, benefit hikes and increased maintenance costs weighing.Southwest forecast higher-than-expected costs in the fourth quarter due to ad spending, tech expenses and costs related to getting the OK to fly to Hawaii.The prevalence of cost fears distracted Wall Street from the only industry statistic it generally cares about: unit revenue, which tries to gauge an airline's efficiency by measuring sales in relation to an airline's available supply of seats and flights. That metric, actually, has been OK.The market had a ""sobering recollection that airlines also have cost structures,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker observed wryly in a research note. He pointed out that management isn't typically ready to talk about unit costs and capacity for the year ahead in October. But he said ""we still wish that most had been better prepared.""Now it was Spirit's turn to gloat.""Consolidation didn't really improve the cost structure"" of legacy airlines, Spirit CEO Bob Fornaro said in October. ""It improved the networks, but the costs are going higher.""Spirit hasn't been spared these cost concerns. Costs are certain to rise if management can strike a deal with its employees. The big three airlines all agreed to pay hikes for employees last year.But some ULCCs have support in high places, and are getting new planes that will enable them to compete even harder.Investor Bill Franke, whose Indigo Partners owns Frontier and other ULCCs, agreed on Nov. 15 to buy 430 new Airbus (EADSY) jets for his carriers, including Frontier, in a deal valued at $49.5 billion at list prices.Frontier will get 100 A320neo jets and 34 A321neos. The narrow-body planes are increasingly popular with airlines, as their range and fuel efficiency have opened more direct routes that previously weren't economical.At a press conference after the pact was announced, Franke, who helped transform Spirit into a ULCC, argued that adding loyalty programs, amenities and other things that raise an airline's costs opens up ""a path to hell,"" according to Bloomberg.""We're firm believers in the ultra-low-cost model,"" Franke told reporters at the Dubai Airshow, where the order — Airbus' largest ever — was announced. ""At the end of the day, in a competitive environment, the lower the cost, the lower the fares, is a winning strategy.""But the big airlines also appear to be firm believers in offering passengers a low-fare option, and American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sees an endgame on the horizon. He said in October that the industry was in the ""final stages of a maturation process,"" in which ULCCs, seeking new markets, run into trouble moving into the nation's big airport hubs.RELATED:New Flights Signal Spirit Airlines Is Still Taking Fight To United, RivalsAmerican Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry News

Tesla (TSLA), meanwhile, continued to slump further below its 50-day moving average and may be gearing toward a test of institutional support at the longer-term 200-day moving average.XTesla dropped more than 3% to 326.41 as volume was on pace to more than double its 50-day average turnover of 5.2 million shares.The stock had cleared a cup with handle at 370.10 in September but did not get far. Earlier this week, the electric vehicle leader triggered the 7%-loss-cutting sell rule, known in IBD rules as the golden rule of investing.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite continued to bounce a bit off intraday lows but still was down 0.7%, on course for its biggest decline since Sept. 25.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were off nearly 0.6%.

The S&P SmallCap 600 lost nearly 0.8%. The Dow transports slumped nearly 1.5%.Going back to Tesla, the large-cap automaker has made a huge run since its initial breakout near 40 to new highs back in April 2013. However, the latest base showed at least one flaw. As seen in a daily chart, the stock lacked smooth, quiet price action.Volume was mostly quiet on the down days in price, and that's good. But Tesla's cup with handle also lacked a sense of symmetry. It took just a little more than two weeks to form the left side of an 11-week base.A good cup with handle will feature calmer action on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as symmetry. Still, chances remain high that the stock will form a new base following the failed breakout.The company shows outstanding top-line growth; due in part to strong sales of its Model S and X brands, revenue is seen rising 28% to $2.95 billion in the third quarter.

1279,ALK,"Discount carrier Frontier Airlines is set to get a whole bunch of new jets that could give it more options as it skirmishes with United Airlines (UAL) over cheap fares.XBoeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) on Wednesday announced a deal to sell 430 jets to Frontier Airlines and three other partner airlines of Bill Franke's Indigo Partners, a big investor in discount airlines, in a deal valued at as much as $49.5 billion.The memorandum-of-understanding agreement, which Airbus said was its ""largest single announcement ever,"" was announced at the Dubai Airshow. It would hand Frontier 100 A320neo jets — a narrow-body jet that usually seats around 150 people — and 34 A321neos, which typically seat around 185 people.The remaining A320s and A321s would go to other ultra discounters when the agreements with each are finalized: Wizz Air in Hungary, JetSmart in Chile, and Volaris in Mexico.""This significant commitment for 430 additional aircraft underscores our optimistic view of the growth potential of our family of low-cost airlines, as well as our confidence in the A320neo Family as a platform for that growth,"" Franke, managing partner of Indigo, said in a statement on Wednesday.United Airlines closed up 0.5% on the stock market today, Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 0.9%, while American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3%, and Southwest (LUV) added 1.6%.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The deal comes as new types of jets give budget carriers more ways to make their business models work.Frontier, a carrier known for the ""National-Geographic""-esque portraits of animals on its tail fins, this year has made more of a push into Denver, a big, profitable United hub. United, which has tried to match Frontier and Spirit on some fares in its biggest markets, this summer said Frontier's move amounted to a tacit admission that cracks were forming in the ultra-low-cost model.United President Scott Kirby, during the carrier's second-quarter earnings call, said that in moving into a hub, Frontier was taking on the much more complicated duties of handling connecting flights. He added the battle was one that ""I guarantee United will win.""But Airbus' fuel-efficient A321 jets have made low-cost long-haul flights more viable. Such flights have become particularly common between Europe and the U.S. The cheaper airfares offered by the likes of Norwegian Air and WOW air have chipped away at the stronghold Delta, American and United had built up over the Atlantic.JetBlue (JBLU), which has been considering whether offer flights to Europe, has added A321neos to its fleet and has an option to take delivery of the Airbus A321LR — an alternate version of the A321neo.On its website, Airbus says the A321LR is ""ideally suited to transatlantic routes, and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.""RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Mulls 767 Passenger-Jet Reboot As '797' LoomsWill Delta Air Lines' Spat With Boeing Weigh On Massive Plane Order?American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers Fall

1280,ALK,"American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday said it will add seasonal service between Dallas and Iceland, while ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) announced new service from Richmond, Va., to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.XThe announcements come as American and legacy rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) look for ways to compete against budget long-haul carriers in Europe, and as Spirit positions itself for Spring Break.American said that it would begin offering its seasonal service from its Dallas-Fort Worth hub to Iceland's Reykjavik-Keflavik airport on June 7. Tickets go on sale on Nov. 20. The move would pit American against WOW air, a low-cost, long-haul carrier in Iceland that also offers flights between those two airports.Reykjavik, American noted, has become ""a very popular leisure destination"" and complements its ""continued growth from Dallas-Fort Worth, including Rome and Amsterdam.""WOW Air in August said it would add flights from four Midwestern U.S. cities to Reykjavik starting this coming spring for as low as $99.99 one way.During its third-quarter earnings call last month, American said that unit revenue in the trans-Atlantic market, where competition from European discounters is intense, rose during the third quarter. Better pricing and ""easing comps from past terror events"" in 2016 helped with the improvement.Still, management said that they expected to see more of the same in the region for the fourth quarter, with discounting from expanding low-cost carriers still ""aggressive.""

1282,ALK,"American Airlines (AAL) on Thursday said it would be ""disappointed"" if unit revenue next year was outpaced by an oft-used measurement for costs, but shares of the airline sank after it signaled that its 2018 flight capacity would escalate from the growth expected this year.XInvestors also digested a forecast for higher costs from Southwest Airlines (LUV), a day after Alaska Airlines (ALK) predicted rising expenses. But they gave Spirit Airlines (SAVE) a boost after the discount carrier signaled it had stopped some of the bleeding after rivals tried to match it on airfares.The forecasts come as analysts increasingly pick over executives' remarks for clues as to how the industry will navigate 2018. When United Airlines (UAL) management last week provided next to no clarity on how it would meet long-term financial goals and keep costs in line next year as it expands service, Wall Street deep-sixed the stock, sinking it 12%.While other analysts have argued that United's problems are uniquely its own, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note last week that ""we believe more clarity regarding 2018 industry growth will be a primary catalyst for airline stocks"" for the rest of 2017.American management on Thursday said that it was still developing its 2018 operating plans, with a formal flight capacity to come when it reports fourth-quarter results. But on a schedule-over-schedule basis, it said it expects capacity — or available seats on flights and how far and often they get flown — to be up roughly 2.5% next year, another focal point for some analysts.That would be higher than the roughly 1% expected for this year, raising the prospect that other airlines might add flights to match American and cut fares to compete.The carrier also said it expected adjusted unit costs to rise around 2% next year, with higher salaries and benefits — as well as costs related to maintenance, rents and landing fees — likely contributing the increase.Few other specifics were given about how American will navigate 2018. But management repeated during the call some iteration of ""we know who we are"" or ""we're running our own show.""""We're not going to define ourselves against what others are doing,"" CEO Doug Parker said.Shares plunged 4.7% to closed at 48.63 on the stock market today, reversing an earlier gain to 53.19. The stock is working its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 53.84 buy point. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2.5%, and United Airlines rose 0.1%.Still, Parker touted American Air's ""measured rollout"" of Basic Economy after United's more aggressive expansion of the fare class made it temporarily uncompetitive. American said demand for Premium Economy seats remains high, and about half of its customers are buying main cabin seats when given the option between that and Basic Economy.American's earnings followed a travel advisory the NAACP issued this week warning African American passengers against traveling with the carrier. In its announcement, the NAACP cited several incidents that it said ""suggest a corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias on the part of American Airlines.""Parker said the carrier was eager to learn from any missteps, and that it expected to work with the NAACP on the issue in the ""very near term."" Asked if the advisory had an impact on bookings, Parker said: ""We haven't seen anything, but that is not the point.""The carrier sees Q4 unit revenue increasing 2.5% to 4.5%, and said the demand environment ""remains robust."" Unit revenue measures sales an airline gets in relation to how many available seats it has and how far and often it flies them.Earnings per share of $1.42 topped Zacks estimates for $1.39. Revenue of $10.878 billion missed views for $10.884 billion.Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused more than 8,000 cancellations and reduced pretax earnings by $75 million.""We are playing the long game at American to create value in an industry that has been fundamentally transformed,"" said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker in a statement.Shares of Spirit jumped 6.9% to close at 36.08 on Thursday after the low-fare, high-fee carrier forecast a unit revenue decline of 4%-6%, better than the 6.3% drop in the third quarter due to ""aggressive competitive pricing action in many of our markets.""But for the fourth quarter, the carrier cited ""continued improvement"" in revenue management. It said there was still a leftover impact from Hurricane Harvey, but not one from Irma, and that it had temporarily cut service in its Caribbean locations.Spirit canceled over 1,650 flights related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, costing $40 million in revenue, along with revenue overhang from the flight cancellations related to what it alleged was a ""pilot work action"" earlier this year.This summer, a price-cutting battle between Spirit and United raised Wall Street questions over whether the ultra-low-cost carrier model was broken and whether United could balance cheaper fares with the costs of operations.""Contrary to some rhetoric of late, the Spirit model continues to produce excellent returns,"" CCO Matt Klein said on Spirit's earnings call on Thursday.American CEO Parker may have added to that rhetoric indirectly on Thursday, saying that the industry, after bankruptcies and consolidation, was in the ""final stages of a maturation process."" And he said that ultra-low-cost carriers, in search of new markets, have run into trouble as they move into the nation's big airport hubs. The remarks echoed those of United President Scott Kirby in July.Third-quarter EPS of 94 cents beat estimates for 90 cents; revenue of $687.2 million squeaked past estimates for $687 million.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Southwest said fourth-quarter adjusted unit costs would be ""higher than previously expected"" in large part because of a ""shift in advertising spend"" in the quarter, costs related to the carrier's planned expansion to Hawaii, and technology investments.The cost forecast was ""probably higher than investors were expecting,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.EPS of 88 cents topped forecasts by a penny, while revenue of $5.27 billion came in just shy of expectations for $5.297 billion. Unit revenue fell 0.5%, due to the introduction of a new reservation system. Disruption from natural disasters cost $100 million and forced 5,000 flight cancellations.The carrier sees Q4 unit revenue being ""up slightly"" to up 1.5%.Shares sank 3.6% to 55.11 after earlier advancing to 58.72. Southwest is pulling back from a cup-with-handle base entry of 59.67 .RELATED:United Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers FallDelta Air Lines Sees Turnaround In Crucial, Highly Competitive Market

1283,ALK,"In the stock market, focusing on high-quality names going up in price is generally better strategy than targeting the weak price performers, which in many cases are being sold because of deteriorating fundamentals.So what's the best way to identify the market's strongest price performers?IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating (RS Rating) is your ticket. It ranks stocks on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 being the best. A stock with an RS Rating of 99 means it has outperformed 99% of the stocks in IBD's database based on 12-month price performance.The general rule of thumb is to target stocks with RS Ratings of 80 or higher. It's not a steadfast rule, but it's generally a good pond to fish in when looking for strong-performing growth stocks.Stock screens like the IBD 50, Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight and IPO Leaders are loaded with strong price performers with several other compelling traits as well.When it comes to slower-moving, large-cap stocks, it's OK to be a little more lenient with the RS Rating. Dow component Intel (INTC), for example, has been moving sideways since late January, hurting its recent RS Rating of 66. But big buyers have been in the stock lately, though, as the chip giant is in the early stages of breaking out of a flat base with a 38.55 entry.Homebuilders have been showing high relative strength for some time now. Just recently, the group was up about 63% year-to-date, compared to a 13% gain for the S&P 500. No surprise, then, to see multiple names in the group with high RS Ratings. Leaders in the group like D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) recently boasted RS Ratings of 88 and 86, respectively.Meanwhile, airline stocks have been lagging the market. Year-to-date, the group is down 12% year-to-date. Bright spots in the group include Brazil-based Gol Intelligent (GOL) and SkyWest (SKYW). Both have high RS Ratings but are extended past proper buy points. More widely known names in the group, such as Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU), have been showing middling price performance at best, with recent RS Ratings of 20 and 19, respectively.Barracuda Networks (CUDA)  offers another example of how sideways and lagging price action can hurt the RS Rating, which is now at 57. Barracuda has doesn't much since hitting a high of 26.69 about a year ago. Shares were recently trading around 24.39.But using the RS Rating isn't as easy as buying all the 99-rated stocks, thinking they're slam dunks for outperformance in coming months. Sometimes, that is the case, especially when a high RS stock is building a base and poised for a breakout.But stocks with high RS Ratings can also be well extended past proper buy points and too late to buy. In the accompanying table, YY Inc. (YY) continues to show outstanding price strength, but it's extended from an 83.10 buy point. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also owns an outstanding RS Rating. The carmaker is trading tightly near highs after a breakout over an 11.75 buy point. Tight weekly closes after a breakout often yield additional entry points.Buying an extended stock is an easy way to lose money quickly in the stock market. The trick is to find stocks with high RS Ratings that haven taking a breather and moving sideways after a nice run. Those that correct the least tend to hang on to strong RS Ratings.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And WatchFree Access To IBD Premium ContentWhen To Sell Stocks: Is Your Stock ""Living"" Under The 10-Week Moving Average?When To Sell Stocks II: Big Breach Of The 50-Day Moving Average Is A Key Sell Signal

1284,ALK,"Tech stocks lagged on Friday as strength in the transportation, energy and select retail sectors helped boost at least two of the key averages. Apple (AAPL) (94 Composite Rating), meanwhile, appeared poised for a fourth up week in a row.XApple is up more than 1% to 159.84, up mildly from an Aug. 2 breakout past a 156.75 flat base. That base is second stage.Apple's gain wasn't enough to lift the Nasdaq composite, which saw its early gains of almost 0.6% wither to nearly break-even. Sell-offs in medical software, video game software, biotech and security software stocks are weighing on the market.But Apple is a key component of both the S&P 500 and the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, which at around 1:30 p.m. ET rose roughly 0.2% to 0.3%.The correct buy zone for Apple goes up to 164.58, or 5% past the 156.75 proper entry.To find the right buy point in a flat-base pattern, in most cases, take the left-side high and add 10 cents.Airline stocks helped propel the Dow Jones transports up more than 1.4%. At 9156, the sector index is up 0.6% for the week, but still lies more than 6% below a recent 52-week high of 9763.Truck, logistics and ship transport firms are also up 1.5% or more, even with WTI crude oil futures up 0.4% to $47.70 a barrel. WTI futures, however, are still down 5% for the month.Alaska Air (ALK), Southwest Air (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) are all still entrenched below their 200-day moving averages. The airline transport group has sunk to the lower half of IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups amid fierce price competition brought on by some new deep-discount airlines based in Europe.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alaska Air, the former big winner after a breakout in October 2012, now holds a lowly 19 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Composite Rating is 57. Growth stock hunters should focus on those with a 95 or better.Back to Apple, the prospects of further gains in Apple still look intact. One reason: the most recent base is second stage. A high-quality company tends to thrive when coming out of a first, second or third stage base. Fourth and fifth stage bases tend to bring out more sellers and put a breakout in doubt.To count bases, find the proper buy point, then see if a stock climbs a minimum 20% from that entry. A stock that forms a new base before rising at least 20% from a proper buy point is forming a ""base-on-base"" pattern, which counts as one stage.As noted in IBD multiple times in Stock Market Today in January, the iPhone and iMac titan surpassed a 118.12 buy point within a cup with handle on Jan. 6-9, then really picked up steam after it reported a small 2% gain in fiscal Q1 earnings per share and a 3% lift in revenue. As small as those increase were, they broke a three-quarter slump in both the top and bottom lines.Apple gapped up more than 6% on that report, then continued to rally as it went on to report further gains in profit (up 11% and 18%) and sales (up 5% and 7%).More reasons why Apple remains a leader? One, the RS Rating remains strong at 90. Two, Wall Street has been revising its EPS estimates higher. Three, Apple's relative strength line (see it in blue in an IBD or MarketSmith chart) has moved into new high ground, meaning it's beating the S&P 500. And four, the Telecom-Consumer Products group has been improving in rank, to No. 50, up from 87th six weeks ago.The gain in Apple from the 118.12 entry has exceeded 37%.RELATED:How To Invest And Win: The Essence Of A Cup With Handle3 Reasons Why Apple Could Rise Another 20%

1285,ALK,"As carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) engage in a price war, forecasts for unit revenue improvement in the fourth quarter now look too optimistic, according to JPMorgan analysts.XThe firm downgraded the two airlines, along with American Airlines (AAL), to neutral from over weight. JPMorgan also slashed price targets on United to 68 from 84, on American to 53 from 61, on Spirit to 37 from 45 and on Delta Air Lines (DAL) to 67 from 71.Bottom lines will take big hits too, and JPMorgan sees United earning just 64 cents a share in Q4 and Spirit earning just 34 cents a share, according to Benzinga. That compares to consensus EPS estimates of $1.34 for United and 57 cents for Spirit.Airlines have the ability to boost pricing domestically, but that isn't happening yet, JPMorgan noted, adding that higher fuel costs are also weighing on results.Shares of United closed down 2.4% at 59.80 on the stock market today. Spirit fell 3.3% to 33.69, American dipped 0.4% to 46.00, and Delta finished virtually unchanged at 48.25.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV), which was upgraded to overweight and had its price target hiked to 66 from 60, rose 0.7% to 54.72, with JPMorgan saying the discount carrier has a better valuation and risk-reward profile than its rivals. Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU) also received price target hikes.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The major airlines have lowered Q3 unit revenue forecasts in recent weeks, with hurricanes Harvey and Irma adding to the downward pressure. On Tuesday, American cut its Q3 unit revenue outlook to flat to up 1%, compared to an earlier forecast of up 0.5%-2.5%.Last week, United acknowledged the impact the price war is having but vowed to continue offering low fares to compete in key markets, despite the short-term pain.""We don't like where the fare structures are right now. And we don't like the effect it has on short-term earnings,"" CFO Andrew Levy said at a conference. ""It is painful, difficult, but we're going to see it through.""United is also scaling back its ""basic economy"" fares, which were meant to compete with low-cost carriers head-on, in some markets.RELATED:United To Scale Back Basic Economy Amid Price War With Low-Cost RivalsDelta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

1287,ALK,"U.S. stock indexes reverted to their pattern of one step forward, one step back, as the indexes dipped and airline stocks continued their descent.XThe Nasdaq fell 0.1% midday Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.1%. Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq in the stock market today.Airline stocks took the biggest hits. Low-fare airline Spirit Airlines (SAVE) dropped 2.5%. American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) each fell 2%.  Alaska Air (ALK) and Delta Air (DAL) retreated 1.5% a piece.Some market watchers pointed to last week's terrorist attacks in Spain to explain the trouble in airlines stocks. But IBD's airline industry group has been sliding since mid-July. The outlook on unit revenue for the airlines has been weakening.Quality can sometimes protect an investor when a sector or group is struggling. Ireland-based Ryanair (RYAAY) and Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) are the only two airlines with IBD Composite Ratings of 88 or better. Both are outperforming their industry group. While the airline group has dived 18% since mid-July, Copa lost 9% and Ryanair gained 1%.The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. Ryanair's rating is 95, which means it is in the top 5% of all the stocks in IBD's database. Copa carries an 88 rating.On the upside Wednesday, bank stocks were holding up fairly well. The PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) exchange traded fund inched up 0.3% midday Wednesday after gaining 1.2% in the previous session.Blue chips were mostly down, with losers holding the edge on winners by a 5-4 ratio in the Dow Jones industrial average.

1288,ALK,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday hiked its second-quarter forecast for unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, propelled in part by stronger travel demand in the U.S. and Latin America.XThe more optimistic outlook follows a similar one last week from Delta Air Lines (DAL), which cited ""commercial initiatives and an improving revenue environment."" United Airlines (UAL) after the close on Tuesday also offered a solid Q2 unit-revenue forecast.Airline stocks were active on the news from American and United, along with the strong overall market. American rose 4.2% to 53.80 in the stock market today. Delta, which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, climbed 2.2% to 55.48.United, which reports Tuesday, jumped 4.7% to 80.53, moving back above its 50-day line. United is in a short flat base just above a prior consolidation. The potential buy point is 83.14.Southwest (LUV) rose 0.4% to 62.08. Southwest reported June traffic figures earlier this week as well, sticking with its Q2 unit revenue targets.Separately, Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) rose 3.4% to 129.12, breaking out of a cup base with a 125.87 buy point.American said it expected second quarter unit revenue, or airline revenue as it relates to its overall seating capacity and flight coverage, to increase roughly 5%-6%. That's an improvement from an earlier forecast of a 3.5%-5.5%.The carrier said the brighter picture for unit revenue was helped largely by higher passenger yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge passengers more for tickets — particularly in the U.S., Central and South America, and the Caribbean regions.American also said it expects adjusted pretax margin to be 13%-14%, better than an earlier view for 12%-14%. Unit costs excluding fuel and other items were expected to rise roughly 7% during the second quarter, largely because of salary and benefit hikes given to pilots, flight attendants and other staff.For the month of June, American's passenger traffic rose 0.8%. Capacity rose 1.1% and load factor fell 0.2 percentage points to 84.7 %.Demand for air travel has generally improved since the U.S. election in November, helping to push unit revenue higher. The major network carriers have also found more ways to break out costs, offering both ""basic economy"" seating classes to compete with low-cost carriers and more lucrative premium fare options.Alaska Air Group (ALK), the carrier that bought Virgin America in December, said on Wednesday that it expected second-quarter passenger unit revenue to rise around 3.5%. That figure factored in ""historical results"" for the two carriers from last year's Q2, which took place before the acquisition closed.Shares gained 3.3% to 94.63.RELATED:American Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'Is Airline Service Actually Showing Signs Of Improvement?

Hawaiian's score jumped from 65 to 71, while Alaska Air moved up from 68 to 71.Over 100 years of market history reveals that the best-performing stocks typically have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if both airline stocks can continue to show renewed price strength and clear that threshold.After making a huge, but bumpy climb following an October 2013 breakout, Hawaiian Holdings peaked last December. The stock is now building a consolidation with a 61.00 buy point. It's a later-stage pattern, and investors should be aware that those involve more risk.On Tuesday, the stock was up fractionally in light volume, leaving it still about 13% below the entry.Alaska Air's big, multi-year run began in 2012. It then ran into more severe turbulence in late 2015. The stock took flight again last December before pulling back in March. Alaska Air is now trying to complete a new consolidation with a 101.53 entry.The stock has climbed back above its 50-day line, and the 10-day moving average may soon also get back above that benchmark. Alaska Air ended Tuesday about 12% below the potential buy zone.Hawaiian Holdings has posted earnings growth ranging from 29% to 49% over the last three quarters.

Alecensa was approved in 2015 for lung cancer patients who progressed on or are intolerant to Xalkori. Both belong to a class of drugs called ALK inhibitors.After 18 months of follow-up, patients treated with Alecensa survived a median 25.7 months without their disease progressing vs. 10.4 months for patients treated with Xalkori.The presenter called Roche's results ""remarkable"" and ""outstanding,"" and ""declared that Alecensa is now the optimal ALK inhibitor for the first-line setting,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients. First-line treatments are the first defense against a disease.""One of the lung cancer doctors we had breakfast with yesterday also acknowledged that Xalkori is a relatively weak ALK inhibitor and she was likely to change her practice patterns based on (the trial),"" he wrote.Divan noted Pfizer is working on a next-generation ALK inhibitor that could help soften the blow of lost Xalkori sales. Also in lung cancer, Pfizer is developing a second-generation drug that targets a specific receptor, known as an EGFR inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) could be nearing a stock breakout after announcing its plan to beef up its pipeline with the acquisition of True North Therapeutics. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a closer look at Bioverativ's setup.But Pfizer is still struggling vs. newer therapies, particularly those that are considered immuno-oncology drugs. This class aims to block certain interactions involving proteins and enzymes in the immune system that would prevent an immune response.Pfizer's drug, Bavencio, is approved to treat a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Bavencio has shown strong results in liver cancer when combined with Inlyta, Pfizer's liver cancer drug. That should help slow the decline of revenue from Inlyta, Divan said.And though the class of breast cancer drugs known as CDK4/6 inhibitors is about to get more crowded, Pfizer's Ibrance will continue to dominate, Divan said. Though he acknowledged Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali and Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib have shown strong trial results.In prostate cancer, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga will put some pressure on Xtandi, a similar drug Pfizer acquired when it bought Medivation.RELATED:Will Regeneron's Cholesterol-Buster Get Booted In Amgen Battle?Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For Tesaro

1292,ALK,"Richard Branson hinted that he was considering creating another U.S. airline following Alaska Air Group's (ALK) $2.6 billion purchase last year of Virgin America, the carrier that is part of the Virgin brand that he started.A new airline would have to compete in an industry whose barriers to entry have grown higher due to a decade of consolidation that has left Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) in control of 80% of U.S. traffic.Also, a new carrier would increase the supply of available flights, potentially sending fares lower, even as Wall Street pressures the industry to pull back on expanding flight coverage to shore up profit.In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, Branson had been discussing the royalties that Alaska must pay Virgin. He said that Alaska would ""carry on paying royalties — unless we decide to start another airline. So, we'll see what happens.""When asked if starting a new airline was something he would be willing to do, he said: ""Watch this space.""Shares of Alaska were up 2.2% to close at 84.57 on the stock market today. Delta rallied 1.1% to 48.20, while American rose 1.3% to 45.22, heading for a 47.49 buy point. United climbed 2.6% to 77.98, going back above its 76.90 buy point, as Southwest gained 1.3% to 58.04, creeping closer to its 58.83 entry.IBD'S TAKE: The International Air Transport Association estimates that an expansion of the in-flight electronics restrictions imposed by President Trump would cost passengers more than $1 billion annually.Branson's remarks come as Virgin and Alaska argue over how long Alaska should pay royalties. Branson has said that Alaska has to pay royalties on the Virgin brand through 2040, based on the terms of a licensing agreement.However, Alaska, which will retire the Virgin brand in 2019, has said there were many ways out of that deal and that they didn't believe they should keep paying for a name they weren't using.Meanwhile, Alaska's acquisition of Virgin gives it a chance to toughen up its position against Delta on the West Coast and on transcontinental flights.But some have argued that Virgin, despite its upbeat, more cosmopolitan take on air travel, struggled to compete against larger rivals on profitability and against the cheap fares offered by budget carriers.Meanwhile travel demand has been strong, but some analysts have said it hasn't been as strong as once expected following the election. Higher labor costs also threaten the industry's margins.Higher oil prices in recent months also have helped chasten the industry. But that could help capacity stay under control by preventing overexpansion and excess competition.Berkshire Hathaway's (BKRB) Warren Buffett has continued to buy airline stocks after last year's surprise change of heart about investing in the industry as the benefit of consolidation became clear.In its most recent filing, Berkshire hiked its stake in American by 8.4% to 49.3 million shares in Q1 vs. Q4 and bulked up its holdings in Southwest by 10.4% to 47.7 million. Berkshire's position in United was unchanged, and its holdings in Delta were trimmed 8.3% to 55 million shares.RELATED:These Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts StakesThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

1293,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) fell Tuesday as markets weighed conflicting reports on how a laptop ban may be widened on U.S. flights.X Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that laptops may be banned from the main cabins on all flights into and out of the U.S., despite a lobbying effort from the airline industry, which sent executives from the top U.S. carriers to meet with him earlier this month.On Tuesday afternoon, Politico reported the U.S. won't ban the devices on flights to the U.S. from Europe, following a call between Kelly, European Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, and EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc.A few hours later, a Homeland Security Department spokesman reportedly said that Kelly told his European counterparts that the ban is is ""still on the table.""The U.S. has already banned electronic devices larger than smartphones from inbound flights on several Middle East-based airlines originating from several Middle Eastern and African airports.That restriction has hurt carriers like Emirates, which competes against Delta, United and American for lucrative trans-Atlantic traffic. Earlier this month, Emirates said it will reduce flights to several U.S. destinations, citing the device ban as well as tougher policies on security vetting and visas.Shares of Delta sold off 3% early, then halved their losses before closing down 3.4% at 49.06 on the stock market today. Other airlines followed similar patterns. United finished 2.5% lower, re-entering buy range after surging 4.2% last week on oil's latest sell-off. American fell 1.6%, still in buying territory. Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU), which have been adding flights to Latin America, both fell 2% but also are still in buy ranges. More domestic-focused carrier Alaska Air Group (ALK) lost 0.9%, and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) dipped 0.4%.Another factor potentially weighing on airline stocks is news that European budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) is looking to accelerate its global fleet growth with more narrow-body Boeing (BA) planes.The proliferation of low-cost carriers and the expansion of existing ones has turned the trans-Atlantic market into a cutthroat competitive environment and eroded the market share that Delta, United and American once commanded.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair rose 1.45% to 107.76 and are well into profit-taking sell territory after breaking out last month.RELATED:If Airplane Device Ban Expands, It Could Cost You This Much Virgin's Branson Was Asked About Starting A New Airline; He Said ThisThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

1294,ALK,"Airline stocks were moving above the clouds, topping or nearing all-time highs on strong traffic and revenue figures.American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday lifted its second-quarter forecasts for unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, citing better pricing power on fares and lower expected fuel costs. Alaska Air Group (ALK) also turned out solid April traffic figures, following strong data from United Airlines (UAL) late Monday.American Airlines shares rose 4.8% to 47.08 in the stock market today, approaching a 47.49 buy point. United Airlines leapt 4.8% to 78.55, hitting a new all-time intraday high and clearing a 76.90 buy point. Alaska Air Group climbed 0.8% to 84.20 but is trading near five-month lows.Delta Air Lines (DAL) advanced 2.1% to 49.56 continuing to build the right side of a base. Delta Air reported positive April unit revenue last week. Southwest Airlines (LUV) rose 1.4% to 58.28 as the carrier approaches a 59.78 buy point.American said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to rise roughly 3.5% to 5.5%, up from an earlier outlook of 3%-5%. The company forecasts adjusted pretax margin of 12%-14%, up from 11%-13%.The carrier said that passenger traffic for April rose 3.1%, on a modest capacity increase of 0.8%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, was 82.2%, up 1.8 percentage points.Airlines' bookings practices, including how tightly they pack flights, came under intense scrutiny last month after police dragged a passenger from a United Express flight after he refused to give up his seat to accommodate crew members.However, the financial impact from that incident appears likely to be minimal.Even as United settled with the passenger, David Dao, and airline executives were questioned by a House panel, Wall Street has been focused more on airlines' ability to keep their growth plans in check and wring profits from passengers as oil and labor costs rise. Alaska Air Group said its traffic for April increased 7.8%, while capacity rose 4.6%.United reported a 7.4% jump in traffic, outpacing a 4% increase in flight capacity for last month. United said it would stick with its second-quarter forecast for unit revenue, a key metric that gauges an airline's sales in relation to its overall flight coverage.Southwest on Monday reported April traffic rose 8.4%, while capacity rose 7.6%. Load factor rose 0.6 percentage points to 84%. The carrier held to its second-quarter unit revenue forecast of a 1%-2% increase.RELATED:Why Flying On Spirit Airlines Now Is A Real 'Riot'Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThe Latest Threat To Delta, United Comes From This New Budget Carrier

1295,ALK,"British Airways parent International Airlines Group on Friday said sales for its new low-cost, long-haul airline were ""running well ahead of expectations,"" underscoring the threat such European carriers pose to Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).IAG launched its new low-cost, long-haul carrier, called Level, in March. Level in June will start offering flights to out of Barcelona to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Buenos Aires and Punta Cana.Those flights will be offered on two Airbus (EADSY) A330 jets.IBD'S TAKE: Low-cost, long-haul carriers out of Europe have proliferated in recent years, threatening to make a lucrative trans-Atlantic market a little less so for the big three U.S. network carriers.Corporate bookings to North America rose during the first quarter, while demand in Asia, which is set to broaden in the years to come, also accelerated, the company said, according to Bloomberg.Delta Air Lines shares closed up 0.1% in the stock market today, and American rose 1.4%. American is currently in a cup-with-handle base. United added 0.5%. All three stocks are up sharply for the week, above their 50-day lines, following strong April traffic figures from Delta.The apparent demand for Level comes as U.S. airlines deal with their own problems domestically. Lawmakers have pressured the industry to change its booking and transparency practices after passenger David Dao was dragged by police from a United Express flight last month.At a House panel on Tuesday, Joseph Sprague, senior vice president of external relations at Alaska Air Group (ALK)-owned Alaska Airlines, said the carrier was reviewing policies like overbooking, which airlines use to ensure they don't lose out on potential sales.Also at that hearing, Kerry Philipovitch, senior vice president of customer experience at American, said the carrier had ""not established an upper limit on what we will pay to solicit volunteers"" to give up their seats in the event of an oversold flight. Delta and United have pushed that payout ceiling up to $10,000.As low-cost air travel becomes more available, Delta, American and United have rolled out fewer-frills ""basic economy"" fare options.However, William McGee, an aviation consultant at the hearing, argued that much of airlines' investments go to premium seating classes, which drive profit.RELATED:Lawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz: This Is Why Airline Stocks Are FlyingDelta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDragged-Off United Passenger Called 'Unintended Champion' For Change
"
1296,ALK,"Even as a House panel tried to grill United Airlines (UAL) CEO Oscar Munoz and other industry executives Tuesday, shares of top airlines were market leaders. The congressional hearing amounted to lawmakers venting and warning, but not signaling a push for new legislation. Meanwhile, new industry data suggest airlines are getting better at packing planes to capacity.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported positive unit revenue — a measure of sales in relation to an airline's flight and seating capacity — for the month of April.Delta Air led the airline sector higher in the stock market today, rising 5.35% to 47.83, retaking its 50-day moving average.United Airlines (UAL) rose 5.2% to 73.94, also retaking its 50-day line.American Airlines (AAL) ascended 4.25% to 43.87, rebounding from its 200-day line and nearing its 50-day.Southwest Airlines (LUV) climbed 3.6% to 58.33. Southwest is currently in a cup base with a 59.78 potential buy point.Delta's passenger unit revenue in April rose 1%. That's the second straight month of positive results for the key metric. In March, the carrier turned passenger unit revenue positive for the first time since November 2015.Delta's flight capacity fell 0.8%. Traffic for the month rose 1.6%.Delta's monthly traffic results come as the very things that airlines do to make investors happy — higher fares, lower capacity and tighter operations — were scrutinized by lawmakers in a hearing before members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.During that hearing, lawmakers called out airlines for a recent string of ""disturbing customer-service breakdowns"" — most notably the violent removal of passenger David Dao from a United Express flight last month that resulted in a settlement between him and the carrier.United's CEO, Oscar Munoz, who attended the hearing with President Scott Kirby, said that event was marked a ""serious breach of public trust"" and apologized for an ""inadequate"" response. Munoz also reiterated changes the airline would make in the wake of the incident.Also in attendance were Bob Jordan, Southwest's CCO; Kerry Philipovitch, senior vice president of customer experience at American; and William McGee, aviation consultant for Consumers Union.Overbookings, a decade's worth of consolidation, passenger contracts as long as 67 pages, the overall ""miserable"" experience from booking a ticket online to going through a TSA checkpoint to waiting at the gate — all those subjects and more were on the table for the House panel.""I can't get comparable prices, so before the ticket, I'm frustrated,"" said Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, who had no questions.And GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter of California — who said he'd considered using his time to gauge the industry's contempt for the American people — said it was ""an absolute joke"" that competition existed in the airline industry, citing a lack of choice in many markets.""We don't have a choice. ... The American people have to fly, all the time,"" he said.Two lawmakers on the panel called for the Government Accountability Office to look at ways to improve operations and consumer protections.Airline executives said competition has intensified over the years, despite the merger wave that began in the prior decade. Low-cost carriers threaten them domestically and internationally. And executives said overbooking — which, in a way, oversupplies flights — allows them to keep fares low and made scores of seats available.Southwest has said it would end overbookings, potentially by the middle of this year, but Jordan said some flights could be oversold for operational reasons.""This is an intensely competitive industry,"" said Philipovitch. She added, ""This competition is good for consumers.""However, most executives wouldn't get into specifics on what measures they would take to make passenger rights easier to understand.When asked if they would create a one-page document that outlined passenger rights, Munoz and Kirby said they supported simplicity but were unsure about whether the document would be one page. Joseph Sprague, senior vice president of external relations at Alaska Air Group's (ALK) Alaska Airlines, said ""that would be our goal."" Philipovitch and Jordan said they favored simplicity.""You may think you're looking at members of Congress,"" said Democratic Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes of the District of Columbia. ""But really you're looking at your customer base.""RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

1297,ALK,"When Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) CEO Warren Buffett loaded up on airline stocks last year, he reportedly did so because years of mergers consolidated the industry into a handful of large carriers that kept a lid on competition for passengers and made business more stable.But as Thursday's market freakout over American Airlines' (AAL) higher labor costs shows, airlines still have to battle each other aggressively on employee pay and costs, even as the ""wide moat"" that drew Buffett to the sector protects the carriers from new entrants.What's more, airlines still remain competitive on adding seats and flights to different parts of the world. American in January suggested that it might ratchet up domestic flight capacity, and United defended its own growth plans. Moves like that, as they have over the past two years, threaten to raise investors' stress about more competition and fare discounts that erode profits and returns.American late Wednesday said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers. Wall Street got mad Thursday, and shares closed down 5.2% on the stock market today, after sinking as much as 8.6% earlier.Southwest (LUV) added to worries about higher expenses in the airline sector when it reported Q1 earnings that missed forecasts, with costs weighing there too. Shares fell 2.1%.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 1.4,% and United Airlines (UAL) dipped 0.9%. JetBlue (JBLU) edged 0.5% lower, and Alaska Air Group (ALK) sank 3.8%, while Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 0.1%. Berkshire Hathaway shares dropped 0.6%American said the higher pay would raise costs by some $230 million this year — hitting EPS as much as 35 cents per share, Cowen analysts said — and $350 million for next year and 2019, which could impact EPS by up to 50 cents.In a statement Wednesday, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said the proposed midcontract pay raises follow a commitment after its merger to compensate staff on the same level as its rivals.""But as our industry has rapidly evolved and pay increases at other airlines have accelerated, some of our colleagues have fallen behind their peers at other airlines in base pay rates,"" the statement said. ""And, unless their current contracts are modified, they'll remain far behind for more than two years.""But the potential pay hike worried some analysts.""We are troubled by AAL's wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note quoted by Reuters. ""In addition to raising fixed costs, American's agreement with its labor stakeholders establishes a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry.""Pilots and flight attendants ratified new five-year contracts in 2014 and 2015, ahead of pay raises at American's two biggest rivals. However, the statement added that currently, pilot hourly pay rates were roughly 8% lower than the industry's best, while rates for flight attendants were around 4% lower. The pressure from labor groups has been building.""While the move is a drag on earnings, it likely removes an overhang on the shares,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a research note.The proposal needs union approval, and management said ""we do not expect disagreement."" Other analysts, however, expressed caution about the response from workers.""We believe there is some risk that they think they should be paid more than Delta and United employees,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""Giving pay increases out of negotiations is risky and could backfire.""Southwest, meanwhile, said it expected unit costs, excluding fuel and other items, to rise around 6% in Q2, based on current cost patterns.In Q1, Southwest said costs rose ""due to the significant snap up in wage rates"" following its own new contract for flight attendants and pilots that took hold in Q4. Costs were also up due to the preparation of a new reservation system.EPS during the quarter fell 31% to 61 cents, after industry profits were padded a year ago by cheap fuel prices, missing estimates for 63 cents. Revenue slipped 1% to $4.883 billion, missing views of $4.92 billion.Still, Southwest forecast positive unit revenue, or sales as they relate to an airline's flight capacity, in Q2.As for American, its quarterly results and forecast on Thursday remained solid despite the potential extra labor costs and sees Q2 unit revenue rising 3%-5%, reflecting better demand in corporate and leisure travel. Adjusted pretax margins in Q2 are expected to come in at 11%-13%.Q1 EPS plunged 51% to 61 cents, after cheap fuel padded profits a year earlier. Those results topped estimates for 57 cents. Revenue ticked up 2% to $9.624 billion, just shy of expectations for $9.629 billion.The company said that results so far in its Basic Economy fare class were ""encouraging.""""Approximately 50% of customers who are presented with a choice for Basic Economy end up choosing a Main Cabin fare, showing that they understand their options and are choosing the ticket that's the right fit for their travel,"" Isom said in a statement.Meanwhile, United said it would raise its payout ceiling for travelers bumped from flights to $10,000 after one such passenger was dragged from a plane earlier this month. The company, which promised a review of that incident by April 30, after it drew worldwide anger, also said it would reduce overbookings, among a series of other policy changes.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

1298,ALK,"United Airlines (UAL), which resurrected its ""fly the friendly skies"" slogan a few years ago, said it would review Sunday's forcible removal of a passenger, who was taken to a hospital for injuries, while the police officer involved was put on leave for violating standard procedure.The Associated Press reported earlier that airline staff had chosen four passengers to get off the flight, which United said was overbooked. Three agreed to leave Flight 3411, headed to Louisville from Chicago, but the fourth didn't.Video surfaced Sunday showing police grabbing the passenger, wrestling him from his seat and dragging him by his wrists down the aisle after he didn't want to leave the flight. The man can be seen screaming as he was removed, then turning motionless and silent, followed by exclamations from passengers.One of the officers involved didn't follow standard procedure and was placed on leave, Chicago's aviation department told the AP. The passenger, who was described by Chicago police as ""a 69-year-old Asian male,"" was taken to a hospital after his head hit an armrest, according to a statement obtained by NBC News. Another passenger told the AP that the man who was dragged off the plane said he is a doctor and needed to see patients the next day.""This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in an emailed statement. ""I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly with him to address and resolve this situation.""@United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane.

We wanted to get our customers to their destinations, and when one gentleman refused to get off the aircraft, we had to call the Chicago Police Department.""United, in the statement to Business Insider, referred further inquiries about the passenger to authorities.Even as people online expressed disgust with how the situation was handled, Wall Street's reaction was muted. Shares closed up 0.9% in the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday as it works out its own booking issues, slipped 0.4%. American Airlines (AAL) climbed 1.2%. Southwest (LUV) edged down 0.6%.United last month drew ridicule after it kept two teenage girls who were wearing leggings from a flight. The two girls were boarding with passes that give free boarding to United employees or their family. The company said the leggings ran afoul of its attire standards for such passengers, which the company says represent it when they board.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline stocks come off a postelection rally and try to temper investor expectations, global travel demand remained solid in February, the International Air Transport Association said last week. After the close Monday, United said it expects Q1 passenger unit revenue to be ""approximately flat,"" compared to a forecast last month for a range of down 1% to up 1%. United said that passenger traffic for March rose 3%, with capacity up 3.4%.Meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) boosted its first-quarter unit-revenue outlook to a 6.5%-8% increase, up from an earlier forecast of a 4%-7% bump.The company also hiked its unit-cost outlook for the quarter, to a 6%-8% increase, to reflect a new pilot contract and new accounting standards.""With the pilot contract now in place, the focus for the company will shift to execution,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""Hawaiian is facing increased competitive capacity in the neighbor island markets, but continues to see better yields from the West Coast to Hawaii.""For the year to date, Hawaiian said capacity rose 3.5%.

That's up from a prior outlook of 1%-2% growth.United's extra flight coverage comes as Alaska Airlines on Wednesday said it would add six new routes from San Diego — part of a broader plan to establish a stronghold on the West Coast. Alaska Air Group, which recently bought Virgin America, said last week that it would add 13 new flight routes from the Bay Area.Investors over much of the past two years have wanted airlines to temper their plans to increase capacity after cheap oil made it easier to expand and compete. That expansion prompted concerns that the industry was adding flights and cutting fares too aggressively.In the fourth quarter, Wall Street got what it wanted. Consumer confidence and travel demand picked up after the election. Even Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB), where Warren Buffett was perhaps convinced that the airlines could operate with the discipline of other large industries, got behind the business. But there have been concerns recently that capacity could creep back up, now that demand and fundamentals have improved.Still, United on Wednesday said it expected positive passenger-unit revenue in Q2 and sees unit costs to be lower for the year than initially expected.During United's Q1 earnings call in January, President Scott Kirby said that, assuming the market holds up the way it has, ""I think we're going to be at positive (passenger-unit revenue) either this quarter, or certainly next quarter.""The company on Wednesday said the first quarter ""has played out largely as expected.""Airline shares reversed higher, with United closing up 2.4% at 68.17 on the stock market today after falling earlier to 64.32, puncturing the bottom of a flat base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 2%, American Airlines (AAL) rose 2.1%, and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.7%. Alaska added 0.9%.Delta, in its own conference presentation Wednesday, said that rising postelection demand in the U.S. had spilled over into 2017. And it said that business yields — or a measure of an airline's ability to charge business travelers more for airfare — had improved ""but remain well below historical levels.""American's presentation touted the carrier's ""unprecedented investment in product,"" saying it expected capital expenditures to surpass Delta and United this year. The company said that with the addition of new jets and the retirement of old ones, it expected to have ""the youngest fleet of the major airlines"" by the end of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Along with the stress of matching rivals on when they add flights or cut fares, the major U.S. airlines also have to contend with low-cost carriers that have set their sights on the trans-Atlantic. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said in a regulatory filing that it expected Q1 unit revenue to fall 4%-5%, more than its prior view for a 2.5% dip. The shift in timing for the Easter holiday to April this year is affecting March travel plans. Delta, American and Southwest also have cut unit revenue forecasts for Q1.But Spirit, like United, said it expected unit revenue to turn positive in Q2.Spirit rose 2.6% on Wednesday.Wednesday's stock gains in the sector followed two days of steep losses as Winter Storm Stella hit the Northeast and forced thousands of flight cancellations, pressuring the Dow Jones Transportation Average.CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said that the financial impact of the storm would be lighter than others and the airlines were well-prepared as the storm approached. He also said that oil prices had fallen over the past week and could keep falling, potentially easing the cost burden for the airlines in the months ahead.""We think U.S. airlines were well positioned ahead of Winter Storm Stella, cancelling flights to ensure equipment does not get stranded and operations can quickly scale up once the storm passes,"" he wrote in a research note, later adding that ""storms are part of the airline business.""RELATED:Southwest Joins Delta, American In Cutting Unit Revenue Forecast 
"
1303,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Korean Air have agreed to form a joint venture to share costs, sales and schedules and expand code-sharing, Delta said early Wednesday Eastern time, a move that could strengthen its position in the trans-Pacific as competition escalates just about everywhere else.The agreement comes after American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday agreed to invest $200 million in China Southern Airlines (ZNH).That decision, American said, would give travelers ""an unmatched range of destinations in two critical markets for business and leisure travelers."" The two carriers are expected to begin a code-sharing agreement later this year.The International Air Transport Association has forecast that China will be come the world's biggest air-travel market by 2024, Bloomberg noted. Delta already owns part of China Eastern Airlines (CEA).The focus on the trans-Pacific comes as low-cost carriers try to chip away at areas long controlled by the big three U.S. network carriers. Budget carrier Frontier Airlines is reportedly hoping for an IPO in the second quarter. British Airways parent International Airlines Group this month said it would launch a low-cost, long-haul airline that would fly to the U.S. from Barcelona.IBD'S TAKE: As U.S. carriers turn toward the trans-Pacific, they already face a new breed of low-cost, long-haul carrier over the trans-Atlantic. Shares of Delta closed down 1.25% on the stock market today as higher crude futures signal higher fuel costs ahead. American Air slid 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 1.3%. Both Delta and United were making their way through consolidation patterns.Delta's agreement with Korean Air still awaits regulatory approval, would cover more than 80 destinations in Asia and more than 290 in the Americas. Delta flights from Atlanta to Seoul will start in June, while Korean Air this summer will add service from Seoul to the West Coast.""This agreement deepens our long-standing partnership with Korean Air and will provide the global access and seamless service our customers demand,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement.Korean Air's CEO, Yang Ho Cho, said the move would help ""reinforce Incheon airport's position as a major international hub in North East Asia and support the growth of Korea's aviation industry.""And more broadly, the international picture for U.S. airlines could grow more complicated. The U.K. on Wednesday formally declared its intent to leave the European Union following a vote to do so last summer, potentially jeopardizing the airlines' ""Open Skies"" agreements in the area. Meanwhile, President Trump's second attempt at a travel ban remains tied up in federal court.Among more domestic-focused carriers, Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock fell 1.3%, Alaska Air Group (ALK) 2.1% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) 0.9%.RELATED:What The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand 
"
1304,ALK,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped on Monday after Delta cut its first-quarter outlook and President Trump signed his second attempt at a travel ban.The new travel restrictions affect six largely Muslim nations — Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — and take hold on March 16. The revised order excludes Iraq, a nation seen as crucial to the fight against ISIS, but blocks travel to the U.S. from the other six nations for 90 days.The order issued Monday said that Iraq presents a ""special case"" and that the nation's relationship with the U.S. and its ""commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq.""The new order also suspends the entry of any refugee for 120 days but does not bar Syrian refugees indefinitely, as the first order did. The order also doesn't bar dual citizens and green-card and visa holders.The administration said the restrictions — both in the new order and the initial one signed on Jan. 27 that has since been left for dead in the federal courts — were necessary for security reasons and would give the U.S. time to make sure its vetting procedures for incoming travelers were sufficient.""This executive order provides a needed pause, so we can carefully review how we scrutinize people coming here from these countries of concern,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday in prepared remarks.The new ban comes the same day as a report from travel research firm ForwardKeys that showed international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5% from Jan. 28 to Feb. 4, the days between when the first travel ban was implemented and then suspended by the Department of Homeland Security.Confusion ensued as agencies tried to figure out how to implement the first travel ban, and protesters flooded airports.The U.S. airlines have no direct flights to the seven countries affected, Cowen said in a note at the end of January, but said alliance partners could be affected.While Cowen said it expected ""minimal"" financial impact from the ban issued in January, the firm expressed concern about the broader impact such restrictions would have on tourism.Meanwhile, the day-to-day focus on airlines' margins, costs and attempts to balance supply and demand continued on Monday. In a conference presentation, Delta cut its first-quarter operating margin forecast to 10%-11% and its outlook for passenger unit revenue to roughly flat. In January, the carrier said it expected 11%-13% operating margin for Q1 and for passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2%.The company cited higher fuel and labor costs, following the recovery in oil prices and new contracts with employees, as reasons for the weaker outlook.Delta also said first-quarter unit revenue, a key industry metric that measures revenue by way of overall flight capacity, was on pace to come in at the low end of its forecast ""given a more moderate pace of improvement in February than initially anticipated."" Delta reported flat passenger unit revenue for February.However, Delta said unit revenue should improve throughout the year on the back of strong postelection demand and better business-travel trends, among other things. The carrier also stuck with its expectations for first-quarter capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flight coverage — to be flat to down 1%.Delta Air Lines fell 2.55% to 48.65 in the stock market today, tumbling through its 50-day moving average. American Air and United lost 3.2%. Southwest (LUV) retreated 2.2%. Alaska Air Group (ALK) descended 2.4%.Trump's Jan. 27 executive order, which was blocked last month by a U.S. appeals court, indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from coming into the U.S. and placed a roughly four-month ban on all refugees. The order also blocked for three months anyone coming from seven predominantly Muslim nations: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.IBD'S TAKE: While Trump's travel ban has raised concerns about travel demand, he has vowed to roll back regulations for the airline industry, lifting shares of U.S. carriers. He has met with airline executives and, on Friday, his administration halted some Obama-era consumer-protection measures. Bookings from the seven countries affected by the first travel ban plunged 80% over that time and fell 23% from the Middle East and Africa overall, the ForwardKeys report said.Demand recovered after the travel ban was suspended, the report showed, but weakened near the end of last month as the administration signaled it would issue a revised travel ban.RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpBuffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-MartCan Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.1% and the S&P 500 index 0.2%, as the Fed raised rates but didn't signal a faster pace of hikes going forward.  The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from recent peaks on the ""dovish rate hike,"" pressuring bank stocks such as the Dow's JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Homebuilders rallied on the lower yields, while steel stocks climbed on bullish earnings forecasts.The Federal Reserve gave financial markets what they wanted, hiking rates a quarter-point, as expected, but stuck to its plan for two more hikes this year and three next year. Policymakers' recent hawkish signals had markets bracing for a quicker ramp-up. The news was great for homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and Toll Brothers (TOL), since it means that mortgage rates may stabilize for a time after their recent run-up, helping boost the spring selling season. Financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which had been pushing higher on hopes for faster rate hikes that can help lift net interest margins, took a breather after the Fed news.RELATED:Chip giant Intel (INTC) announced a deal to buy Mobileye (MBLY), a maker of advanced driver assistance systems, for $15.3 billion. Analysts described the deal as a defensive acquisition for Intel to compete against Nvidia (NVDA), which has been scoring numerous partnerships to supply the artificial-intelligence processing power for self-driving cars. Nvidia's latest partnerships are with auto parts supplier Bosch to bring self-driving cars to the masses and with truck maker Paccar (PCAR) to develop autonomous trucks.Tesla announced that it would sell $750 million in convertible debt and $250 million in stock. With underwriter options, Tesla will likely raise $1.15 billion. That's less than some analysts had expected after CEO Elon Musk warned that the Model 3 would push cash levels ""close to the edge.""

That gives travelers more options, but the expansion carries risks of overestimating demand and a competitive response from rival airlines. United last month said it would add service to 31 new destinations to serve areas that connect to its airport hubs.

The West-Coast-centric carrier, in an investor update last month, said it expected unit revenue to be roughly flat from a year ago.Nonfuel unit costs were also expected to be roughly flat, potentially making the carrier unique in an industry facing higher expenses after striking new agreements with staff, Cowen & Co. noted.Results: Adjusted EPS, excluding costs related to its mid-December Virgin American takeover, rose to $1.56. Revenue climbed 11% to $1.52 billion. Q4 traffic swelled 13% on a 10.3% capacity increase, including Virgin. Unit revenue rose 0.3% but passenger unit revenue fell 0.9%. Operating costs excluding fuel and special item edged up 0.1%.Alaska Air also raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents from 27.5 cents.Outlook: Q1 non-fuel unit costs to remain flat when factoring in earlier financials from Virgin America.Stock: Shares jumped more than 4% early to new highs but pared gains by the afternoon, closing up 3.3% at 97.19 on the stock market today. Southwest (LUV) fell 0.2%, JetBlue (JBLU) rose 2.3% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) fell 2.55%.Late Wednesday, United Airlines (UAL) said January traffic rose 4% as capacity climbed 4.7%, though the carrier attributed 3 percentage points of capacity growth to year-ago weather disruptions.It still sees Q1 passenger unit revenue to range from a 1% dip to a 1% increase.IBD'S TAKE: Along with Gulf carriers, Delta, American and United are facing a growing threat over the Atlantic from low-cost, long-haul carriers.On Thursday, President Trump is set to meet with airline CEOs, although it was unclear who would attend.

But shares in Lumentum, whose core business is optical communications, surged 22% for the week after its CEO discussed an emerging 3D sensor market opportunity — not included in company guidance. Some analysts speculated over an Apple iPhone 8 design win, though Apple may have multiple 3D device suppliers.Fabrinet (FN), which provides optical packaging and assembles optical, electromechanical and electronic devices for other manufacturers, reported fiscal Q2 earnings growth of 82% and a 51% revenue, both better than expected.

1316,ALK,"Executives from Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Southwest (LUV) and others met with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.As the meeting began, Trump said he would work to cut ""burdensome regulations"" in their industry and said the current air-traffic control system is obsolete. The president also said he would have an announcement related to taxes in the next few weeks.Gulf-carrier competition, which for years has been a major sore point for the U.S. network carriers, was not discussed, apparently, despite widespread expectations it would be high on Thursday's agenda.When asked by CNBC after the meeting if the subject came up, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the focus of the meeting was ""solely"" on taxes, regulations and the need for infrastructure investments.However, Trump did allude to looming competition from abroad during introductory remarks at the meeting.""I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers — I've been hearing that a little bit,"" he said. ""At the same time, we want to make life good for them also. They come with big investments. In many cases, those investments are made by their governments.""Trump's executive order suspending immigration and refugees from seven largely Muslim nations deemed a security risk was not on the agenda, Bloomberg said. Airline stocks sank after that order was signed, on Jan. 27, amid concerns that it would hurt travel demand. Late Thursday, a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court's suspension of the ban.Executives from Alaska Air Group (ALK), FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) were also set to attend, Bloomberg said. American Airlines' (AAL) CEO, Doug Parker, did not attend due to an already-scheduled management conference taking place.Delta shares were up 2.6% on the stock market today, while American rose 2.75% and United advanced 1.8%. JetBlue added 3.5%, Southwest rose 3% and Alaska Air rallied 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Norwegian Air International is an Irish subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, whose low-cost trans-Atlantic flights already pose more competition to Delta, American and United. The big three are trying a variety of cheap and expensive seats to compete. Following the meeting, statements from the airlines also notably left out any mention of the Gulf carriers.JetBlue: ""Today we had an extremely encouraging conversation with the president about modernizing our air traffic control system to reduce frustrating flight delays and further improve aviation safety. Everyone agreed we need an infrastructure plan that will once again give the American public an aviation system we can be proud of.""United: ""We share the President's passion for the tremendous opportunity this country has and his commitment to protecting and creating American jobs. We look forward to working together with the President on the many initiatives and issues that will make America better and the U.S. aviation industry the best in the world. This includes modernizing our aviation infrastructure and cutting the red tape that gets in the way of our industry's ability to deliver the best experience for our employees and customers.""Delta: ""We had a positive discussion about many of the major issues facing U.S. travelers, airline employees and the aviation industry, which is a vital economic engine for America.""The big three U.S. airlines have repeatedly complained that three Persian Gulf-region carriers — Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad — benefit from government subsidies that give them more room to expand and compete in the U.S. The Gulf carriers, in turn, have repeatedly denied that claim.The subsidies, the U.S. airlines say, violate the Open Skies agreements that facilitate cross-border service.""If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans,"" CEOs from Delta, American and United said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ""In fact, for every long-haul route lost or foregone as a result of subsidized Gulf carrier competition, more than 1,500 American jobs are lost.""But a battle could be heating up over those agreements. CEOs of JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, FedEx Express and Atlas Air (AAWW), in a letter dated Tuesday, urged Tillerson to reject the big three's demands to clamp down U.S. access to the Gulf carriers. Their letter, which expressed support for maintaining global Open Skies arrangements, said those demands ""would jeopardize Open Skies and reduce competition in an already overly concentrated U.S. airline market.""U.S. carriers also argue that Norwegian Air International's recently approved service to the U.S. would allow the carrier to dodge labor and safety rules, Bloomberg said.Trump also said he wanted travelers ""to have the greatest customer service with an absolute minimum of delays, and with the greatest convenience all at the lowest possible cost.""Those remarks follow the bruising that airline stocks took for much of last year and 2015 after airlines dropped fare prices in some markets to lure passengers. That competition damaged unit revenue, an important industry metric that gauges how much money an airline makes compared to its supply of seats and flights.Meanwhile, American Airlines said earlier Thursday that passenger traffic for January fell 0.3%, while carrying capacity rose 1.2%. American backed its first-quarter forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% increase in unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On EuropeAlaska Air Beats Q4 Forecasts; Trump, Carriers To MeetAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back Up

1319,ALK,"Boeing (BA) will add more rows to a planned 737 Max 10X plane that could launch in 2020, as it also readies a new midsize plane that can take on the Airbus (EADSY) A321neo, which has filled a market niche that Boeing exited years ago.The Max 10X will carry 190-230 people, or 10-15 more than the 737 Max 9, but will have the same engines as the rest of the Max family, according to CNN and Aviation Week.While that still falls short of the A321neo's planned capacity of up to 240 by 2018, Boeing's eventual goal is to build a completely new plane that can carry 200-275 passengers and travel up to 5,000 nautical miles, industry officials told CNN.In October, Boeing said it was considering simultaneous development of a midsize plane and longer 737 to fill the gap created by the 757, which saw production end in 2004. Management said in October that the new midsize plane could be delivered by 2024-2025.Boeing shares closed down 0.7% at 158.29 on the stock market today. Airbus' U.S. listed shares dipped 0.3% to 17.22.On Thursday, RBC Capital initiated coverage on Boeing with an underperform rating and 136 price target, citing pressure on profit margins from new commercial platforms.While development of a midsize plane is expected to weigh on earnings and shares, Boeing may have little choice as it has been losing badly to Airbus in that category.Airbus has racked up 1,400 A321neo orders vs. about 425 for comparable Boeing planes, according to Flightglobal Ascend.Also, a recent internal Boeing memo announced plans for involuntary layoffs from its engineers and voluntary layoffs in other divisions, according to a Reuters report out Tuesday, as Airbus takes market share.Meanwhile, Boeing is looking around for commitments from enough customers for the Max 10X, which is seen as a way to help slow the bleeding ahead of the new midsize plane.United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Airlines (ALK) were among top U.S. carriers it hope to seal a deal with for the Max 10, CNN said. International customers could include carriers in China and Indonesia's Lion Air.RELATED: Boeing Lands $8 Billion GE Order After Losing $4 Billion Delta Buy

1320,ALK,"United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) upgraded their fourth-quarter unit revenue estimates Tuesday, a week after Delta Air Lines (DAL) raised its outlook for that metric.United expects Q4 unit revenue to drop 1.25%-1.75% vs. a prior outlook for a 3%-4% decline. Southwest now sees it falling 3%-4%, better than its earlier guidance for a 4%-5% dropBoth carriers cited an improvement in close-in yields, or how much an airline can get passengers to pay for flights booked closer to departure time.For December, United's traffic increased 2.6%, matching its capacity gain. Load factor edged up to 83.1% from 83% a year ago. Southwest's traffic rose 4.2%, while capacity grew 4.8%. Load factor shrank to 82.6% from 83%.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) reported that December traffic including newly acquired Virgin America, rose 5.6% vs. a year earlier as capacity climbed 5%. That pushed the load factor, or seats filled, by 0.5 percentage point to 83.1%.Shares of United rallied 1.8% in extended trading, after closing up 3.3% at 73.66. Southwest finished 2.1% higher at 51.34. Delta rose 2.5% to 50.93 on the stock market today, holding in buy range from a 49.51 buy point. Alaska Air shot up 5.2% to 92.00, hitting a record high. American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3%.Last week, Delta said it expects Q4 unit revenue to decline 2.5%-3%, better than the carrier's forecast last month for a roughly 3% dip, and has said it sees the metric going flat in Q1.The carrier credited strong demand and better close-in domestic yields as well as revenue management and more restrained capacity.Delta reports Q4 results Thursday. Analysts expect earnings per share to tumble 30.5% to 82 cents, with revenue down 1.6% to $9.353 billion.Also late Tuesday, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said December traffic jumped 12.5%, outpaced by a 16.6% surge in capacity.

1321,ALK,"Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) had to ignore requests for information from a potential suitor in order to lock in its offer from Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which pushed for a Jan. 9 agreement date, according to a late-Thursday SEC filing by Ariad.Ariad stock rocketed nearly 73% on Jan. 9 when the company announced it had reached an agreement to be acquired, an announcement timed to coincide with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, one of the industry's big events of the year. Ariad shares rose a fraction to 23.75 on the stock market today, near the Takeda takeover price of $24 a share, or $5.2 billion.Wall Street had suspected that Ariad was the subject of a bidding war, RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research note, after Ariad filed the details of its acquisition with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As it turns out, Takeda ""moved quickly and aggressively"" and was the only formal bidder, Yee wrote in his research note.IBD'S TAKE: Ariad isn't alone with its interesting oncology pipeline. Incyte is now facing limited competition in its Jakafi enterprise after Gilead Sciences' rival drug failed in a late-stage trial in November. Head to The New America for more on Incyte's drivers in 2017.Ariad, after fielding an initial offer from Takeda, had reached out to three other potential suitors who had expressed interest in partnering on its cancer drug brigatinib. Brigatinib is being tested as a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) patients with non-small cell lung cancer.""Per the filing, one of the three companies sought answers to follow-up questions during diligence, but Ariad did not follow up due to rapid timelines and interest in not losing this deal,"" Yee wrote. Ultimately, Ariad accepted Takeda's offer of $24 a share, up from its initial $20, which Ariad deemed the highest and best offer that it would receive. Ariad hadn't traded above 20 since September 2013, nor above 24 since December 2012.According to Ariad's filing, Takeda upped its offer on Dec. 24 but only on the condition of exclusive negotiating rights and contingent on reaching and announcing an agreement by Jan. 9, and the other company had made its inquiry on Dec. 27.

1322,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) forecast improved fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue Wednesday, helped by strong December demand, and Cowen & Co. said the carrier was its top pick, arguing that many of the issues the company faced last year were behind it.Cowen said that while demand and business airfares have strengthened since the election, higher labor and fuel costs would likely deflate the industry's margins this year. But the firm offered reasons to be optimistic about Delta and maintained an outperform rating on it.""We believe investors will look to own shares that underperformed in 2016 given certain company-specific issues,"" analyst Helane Becker said in a research note out Wednesday. ""Both Delta and Southwest (LUV) had headwinds from technology outages in 3Q16, which provide for easier comps than their peers.""She also said that if business yields improve, Delta ""will be one of, if not the, largest beneficiaries of improving yields.""Meanwhile, Cowen kept its outperform rating on Southwest but downgraded the rest of the sector — including American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU) and budget carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) — to market perform from outperform.""We believe with the recent positive trend in the shares and subsequent upward multiple moves the group is due for a break,"" Becker wrote.Shares of Delta rose 2.5% to close at 50.70 on the stock market today, still within buy range. American rose 0.9%, United edged up 0.4% and Southwest climbed 2.6%, now above buy range. Alaska rose 1.3%, JetBlue 1.2% and Spirit 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As airline stocks show more bullish signs, Barclays also says that many carriers could bring ""ample upside for patient investors.""Delta expects Q4 unit revenue to decline 2.5% to 3%, better than the carrier's forecast last month for a roughly 3% dip, and has said it sees the metric going flat in Q1.For December, unit revenue was flat, as traffic growth of 2.6% outpaced a capacity increase of 1.5%. The carrier credited strong demand and better close-in domestic yields — or how much an airline can get passengers to pay for flights booked closer to departure time — for the results, as well as revenue management and more restrained capacity.The flat passenger unit revenue also came ""despite the tougher comparison resulting from the holiday timing,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth noted. Analysts had expressed concern that the calendar timing of certain holidays could put a dent in airlines' December and fourth-quarter results.With unit revenue improving, Cowen said Wall Street could turn its attention to the airline industry's margins in Q2.""The issue we see with the group is that unit revenue is clearly on the road to being positive (year over year) and sooner rather than later,"" Becker noted. ""We expect investors will look for the next issue to nitpick. We believe that issue will be margin compression due to higher jet fuel and labor costs.""Meanwhile, Ryanair (RYAAY), the Irish budget carrier that says its low fares will push rivals out of markets, reported a December traffic increase of 20%.

1323,ALK,"Biotechs have a lot riding on drug data in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group plunged 25% in 2016 after a rocky election year. Relief that Hillary Clinton lost the White House spiked the group nearly 17% in the week following the election, but those gains have since dissipated on Donald Trump's pledge to tackle rising drug prices.The group has faced challenges at its 50-day moving average since April. Meanwhile, large caps like Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are trading at 10%-15% of their no-pipeline valuations, according to RBC analyst Michael Yee. Tugging sentiment out of its 12-month low will require either M&A or strong drug data.""M&A remains a potential coiled spring catalyst if one to two companies could go into play and many large pharmas continue to be on the hunt,"" Yee wrote in a Dec. 29 research report. He sees Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and BioMarin (BMRN) as possible acquisition targets.Outside M&A, Yee said, there's a ""lack of material catalysts to get the sector moving.""IBD'S TAKE: Five top biotechs ended 2016 with triple-digit gains, outplaying the broader industry. Are your biotech picks on that list? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.But nearly two dozen biotech companies this year are slated to post key drug trials data in just four key arenas: drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, PARP inhibitors to treat several types of cancers and therapies to treat lymphoma.Success could turn sentiment positive for the second, but failure could weigh on many drug stocks.Spinal muscular atrophy — which results in the wasting away of muscle and can lead to early death — will see the least new data in 2017 of the four sectors, but it also will host what Yee, in a recent research report, calls the overall drug industry's ""only new real launch"" this year.Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) teamed up to develop Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, a drug that targets a single RNA to treat the symptoms of SMA, Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke told IBD in a recent Q&A.Biogen exercised its worldwide rights to Spinraza in August. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spinraza in late December. It's the first SMA treatment to get FDA approval and Crooke said he expects Biogen to bring the drug to market early this year.He describes SMA as a ""diabolical"" disease that chemically denervates the body. It can be fatal in infants and progresses in toddlers, robbing them of the ability to walk, eat or breathe on their own. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, according to Cure SMA.After Spinraza's launch, midcap Cytokinetics (CYTK) is expected to release the results of a phase 2 trial on CK-2127107, which it describes as a ""novel skeletal muscle troponin activator"" that could help treat SMA patients and others suffering similar degeneration.CK-2127107 differs from Spinraza in that it aims to slow the rate of calcium release from the regulatory troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle fibers. It's in two phase 2 trials, one examining SMA patients and one looking at patients with chronic lung disease, with trial results for the latter further in the future.Cytokinetics is a lightly traded small cap, but has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The stock crept into a buy zone in late December, hitting a 12.65 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation, but has slipped to 10.60 as of Thursday's close, triggering the sell rule anytime a stock falls at least 8% from a buy point Shares rose 16% in 2016.A handful of cystic fibrosis trials are expected to wrap up in 2017 — but Vertex's ""triple pill"" has sparked the most analyst chatter. Both Yee and Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan say phase 2 data for VX-152 and VX-440 are likely to be available in the latter half of 2017 and another trial's results out sooner.VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 are being investigated as a three-prong treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to collect, blocking the airways and damaging the digestive system. VX-661 is in phase 3 testing with results from two patient populations expected in the first half of the year.Yee estimates VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 could add $1 billion to $2 billion in long-term sales for Vertex. He sees ""a fairly good chance the 'triple' will work in the second half of 2017, driving the company's growth. But, he notes that investors remain wary. Vertex stock fell 41% in 2016, but it is up 9.8% this year after falling 2% to 80.91 on Thursday.Vertex is far from alone in the cystic fibrosis game. As many as seven other publicly-traded biotechs are expected to release clinical trial data in 2017. Mid-cap biotech PCT Therapeutics (PCTC) appears furthest along, with phase 3 data for its Translarna due this quarter.The PCT trial examines CF patients with nonsense mutations. According to Cystic Fibrosis News, Translarna could potentially make the cellular protein machinery run the ""so-called stop sign in the CF-causing CFTR gene, replacing it with amino acids similar enough to allow the protein to do its work.""Clovis Oncology (CLVS) pulled ahead of Tesaro in late December when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, rupacarib. A day later, the FDA gave Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, niraparib, priority review. The two are duking it out to rival Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 from AstraZeneca (AZN).Both are deadlocked in a race to treat ovarian and breast cancer. Clovis is on track to unveil phase 3 data for rupacarib — which will sell under the brand name Rubraca — in patients with a BRCA-like mutation in the latter half of 2017. BRCA mutations are often associated with breast cancer.Tesaro's niraparib is on deck for phase 3 breast cancer and phase 2 ovarian cancer data in the second half of 2017. Niraparib has a Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) date of June 30, according to Biopharma Catalyst's FDA tracker.Niraparib, rupacarib and olaparib (the chemical name for AstraZeneca's Lynparza) belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Several forms of cancer are dependent on PARPs, a type of enzyme. By inhibiting those enzymes, companies like Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca hope to treat several cancers.AbbVie (ABBV) and Pfizer (PFE), via its acquisition of Medivation, also are working on PARP inhibitors.AbbVie's veliparib missed several endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations unveiled in early December. Phase 3 testing is underway. Veliparib is also being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September. Medivation's talazoparib is in development to treat breast cancer with germ line BRCA mutations. But neither AbbVie nor Pfizer's PARP inhibitors are expected to have data in 2017.Ariad, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) look poised to lead 2017 in the lymphoma battle — though as many as 10 publicly-traded biotechs are expected to present data this year on varying drugs.Next month, Kite's KTE-C19 will likely come away with ""solid"" six-month durability data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), says RBC's Yee. That could lead to a rolling Biologics License Agreement (BLA) in Q1 and a PDUFA date before year-end.KTE-C19 belongs to a class of drugs called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs teach a patient's immune system to fight off specific cancers. Kite's drug is being investigated as a treatment for refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.Ariad Pharma, on the other hand, already has a PDUFA date of April 29 for its brigatinib, a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib, a Pfizer chemotherapy.Though the PDUFA date is in April, first-line data won't be available until 2018-19. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has similar data for a rival drug due in that same time frame. Ariad completed the New Drug Application (NDA) for brigatinib in October.Also in 2017, Seattle Genetics is angling for a fourth indication for its 2011-approved Adcetris. Adcetris is being examined as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It will also unveil the results of a yearlong phase 3 trial of Adcetris and chemotherapy in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics is trying to establish ""a redefined front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma after nearly 40 years of the same therapy,"" CEO Clay Siegall told IBD in a recent interview.RELATED:Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OKIonis Pharma Eyes Sustainable Profitability After FDA ApprovalAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveBristol-Myers Won't Seek Accelerated Opdivo Lung Cancer OK

1324,ALK,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other key indexes strove to cut early losses on Thursday as the nation remained embroiled in controversy over incoming President-elect Donald Trump and Congress engaged in a deep-fry questioning of Treasury secretary pick Steve Mnuchin.Meanwhile, select large-cap techs brushed off worries over the future of Capitol Hill and the White House as institutional trading desks deployed more capital in names such as Nvidia (NVDA), one of the market stars of 2016 that this week tested support at its 10-week moving average near 99.72, setting off a technical buy signal.Nvidia shares rallied nearly 3% to 105.99, with volume initially running sharply above average pace. But by mid-afternoon, Thursday's pace fell around 25% below average. Nvidia's 50-day average turnover is 19.5 million shares.This is the second time that Nvidia tested the key 10-week line following a late-September breakout past a 63.60 flat-base entry.However, as noted in a past Stock Market Today column, the graphics processors expert staged climax-run-like action at the end of December, meaning that a significant price correction was due.Indeed, that has happened, with the stock falling nearly 18% below its 119.93 all-time high. And yet the stock has been showing much restraint in its current decline, a good sign for long-term holders who have a healthy profit cushion in the stock.The 30-stock Dow industrials index was off nearly 0.4% with less than 45 minutes remaining in Thursday's session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite nursed losses of 0.2% to 0.5%.But the Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial firms in that all-electronic exchange, was virtually flat.Small caps lost their edge following the Russell 2000's solid gain of 0.5% on Wednesday. The Russell caved 0.8% Thursday. With less than an hour to go until the market close, volume is still running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on the Nasdaq and mildly lower on the NYSE.U.S. government long bonds tanked, sending the 10-year Treasury yield up as high as 2.48%. That's still well below its mid-December peak of 2.60%.Returning to Nvidia, one could argue that the stock has already made two pullbacks to the 10-week moving average after its late-September breakout. The first occurred just four weeks into the new rally following that breakout, in the week ended Oct. 14. The second test of that 10-week line took place over a roughly two-week span that began in the week ended Nov. 4.However, in that Oct. 14 week, while the 10-week line in fact was a touch higher than the 63.60 entry, it also could be seen more as an initial pullback to the proper buy point. Such tests can happen in as many as four out of 10 big stock market winners, as IBD research has shown.Regardless, anyone who wishes to add shares to an existing position in Nvidia should take great care in 1) adding only a small amount, which abides by the law of pyramiding into a stock (i.e., adding smaller amounts of shares as a stock rises in price, thus keeping the average cost per share low); and 2) be ready to cut losses very quickly in that newly bought position.Elsewhere in the stock market today, 3M (MMM) is trading just a few points below a potential saucer-with-handle breakout price of 180.16. The shallow chart pattern began forming after the stock peaked near 182 in July last year.Analysts see the Dow component's Q4 earnings up 4% to $1.87 a share.3M is also trading nicely above its 50-day moving average, exactly what you want to see before a potential breakout occurs. The stock's RS Rating improved to 53 from 49 on a scale of 1 to 99, and is in a range typically seen in stocks forming long bases.Apple (AAPL) lifted off early-morning lows to trade nearly flat at 119.81, still in buy range from a breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The 5% permissible buy zone extends up to 124.02. Those who follow CAN SLIM investing rules should in general not chase a stock that breaks out and then moves more than 5% past the proper buy point.On Sept. 14, the iPhone giant cleared a 110.33 buy point in an earlier cup with handle that emerged out of a long bottoming base pattern., then rallied nearly 8% before pulling back, testing support at the pivotal 200-day moving average, and forming its latest new cup pattern.While Apple is not moving with the same gusto as it's done during past huge breakouts over the prior 12 years, the stock's ratings are gradually improving. Apple's 61 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 is up from as low as 52 seven weeks ago, and its up/down volume ratio of 1.4 signifies heavy volume on up days in price relative to down sessions over the past 50 trading days. Focus on those stocks with an up/down ratio of 1.0 or higher. (IBD Stock Checkup, a premium research tool available at Investors.com, shows this ratio for all companies in IBD's database.)Mobileye (MBLY) continues to form its base as shares in the automobile self-driving and assisted-driving tech firm gained 3.7% to 43.59 and is holding nicely above its 50-day moving average.Mobileye showed solid gains following a long, deep cup-with-handle breakout past 48.88 in June 2015 and rallied as much as 29% in less than two months before forming a new flat base.That next base, however, failed, and the Israeli software and vehicle vision systems firm went into an even deeper price slide, falling more than 63% to a low of 23.57 by the first quarter of 2016. Such action indeed marks Mobileye's shift into a bottoming-base action.It's too early to set a new buy point for the mid-cap tech play for now, but the 93 Composite Rating and rising RS Rating of 64, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, suggest that it's worth a spot on aggressive growth investors' watch lists.Later today, watch for quarterly results from airline industry leader Alaska Air (ALK) (earnings seen falling 7% to $1.36 a share) and Dow 30 name IBM (IBM) (EPS seen up 1% to $4.88, which could snap a six-quarter streak of year-over-year declines).IBM is trying to bottom out after striking a low of 116.90 in February 2016. Big Blue has made minimal progress so far since clearing a 165.05 buy point within an aircraft carrier-size saucer-with-handle base.The handle itself, which formed from August to December last year, is long enough to qualify as a flat base.RELATED:Stock Market Today: When Did Nvidia Signal That A Correction Is Near?How To Invest: The Importance Of Pyramiding, And Other Nuggets Of Trading Wisdom From Gerald LoebHow To Invest: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Still Matters Today For Growth And Value InvestorsHow To Invest: Still The No. 1 Rule In Stock TradingCan Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?

The S&P was virtually flat and the Dow Jones industrial edged lower by nearly 0.2%. Small caps  outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 1%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking higher than Monday's level. Nasdaq volume was slightly lower.Dow component Apple (AAPL) added minimally to this month's gains, rising 0.1% to 119.11. Numerous published reports said the company is working on augmented reality (AR) glasses with German firm Carl Zeiss. Apple is still in buy range from a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far.JD.com (JD) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising 2.4% to 26.90, after JPMorgan upgraded the Chinese internet retailer to overweight from neutral, and raised its price target to 39 from 32. JD.com is in a consolidation with a 29.33 buy point. NetEase (NTES), meanwhile, added 2.2% to 239.88.

1327,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) will end their code-sharing agreement after April 30, the carriers said Monday, a largely expected move that follows years of diminishing returns from the deal and Alaska's recent merger with Virgin America.The decision to end the pact also follows escalating competition between Delta and Alaska in Seattle, and Delta said its expansion into that market reduced the need for code-shares, or the agreements airlines make to share flight routes.The decision, Delta said, ""is a positive milestone for both airlines as Alaska focuses on its merger integration with Virgin America and Delta focuses on creating more customer choice at its Seattle-Tacoma International Airport hub,"" where Delta has more than tripled its flights since 2013.Revenue from the agreement has been falling since 2009, and the impact on Alaska is expected to be minimal next year, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. Alaska also has ""a significant number of other partners who serve many of the same markets as Delta,"" she noted.Delta edged up 0.5% to 50.42 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out two weeks ago. Alaska rallied 1.8% to 90.34, nearing profit-taking sell territory. American Airlines (AAL) rose 2% and United Airlines (UAL) added 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of higher oil prices, greater operational discipline and fewer regulations under a Trump presidency have lifted airline stocks in recent weeks. Warren Buffett's recent investment in the airlines hasn't hurt either. Starting May 1, passengers of either airline will no longer be able to earn or redeem Delta miles or Mileage Plan miles on flights conducted by the other airline, Delta said, adding that the carriers will keep an ""interline agreement"" that allows connectivity for ticketing and baggage.Alaska closed its purchase of Virgin last week, making it the fifth largest U.S. airline and a stronger player on the West Coast.Alaska, in announcing the merger's closing, said that it plans to make a decision on what to do with the Virgin America brand early next year. Still, Alaska CEO Brad Tilden said that ""Alaska Airlines and Virgin America are different airlines, but we believe different works — and we're confident fliers will agree.""RELATED:Delta's Costs Spike But Yields Improving; Southwest, Hawaiian Flirt With BuysAlaska Air Takes On Some Heavy Baggage With Virgin BuyoutAmerican Airlines Signals Even Faster Unit Revenue Recovery Than Delta

1328,ALK,"Restaurant stocks, airlines and department stores were under the analyst microscope Thursday morning, in particular: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Southwest Airlines (LUV), United Airlines (UAL), Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M).Shares of both retailers are withering in early trade after logging poor holiday sales and cutting earnings forecasts late Wednesday.Robert W. Baird and Telsey Advisory Group slashed their ratings on Kohl's, with Baird downgrading the value department store chain to neutral from outperform and cutting its price target to 44 from 60. Telsey now has a market perform (from outperform) and 47 price target from 58.Macy's received price target cuts from RBC and Telsey to 35 (from 43) and 38 (from 42), respectively.Kohl's shares sank 19% to close at 42.01. Macy's tumbled 13.9% to 30.86.Wedbush's Nick Setyan upgraded the beleaguered fast-casual dining chain to neutral from underperform and boosted its price target to 400 from 370, citing ""1) a lack of a postelection upward revaluation relative to peers; 2) a post-Q3 downward revision of 2017 Street expectations below our estimates; and 3) our belief that a recent shift toward a focus on margins vs. a recovery in sales renders lowered expectations realistic.""Shares rose 2.6% to finish at 391.89 in the stock market today, moving back above the 50-day line.Meanwhile, Setyan downgraded BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD).Morgan Stanley downgraded United to equal-weight while upgrading Southwest to overweight.The bank's analyst action comes on the heel's of Cowen's slew of downgrades on Wednesday, taking the ratings ax to United, American Airlines (AAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU) and budget carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE).United shares ended down 2.9% Thursday while Southwest lost 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Cowen left Southwest's outperform rating well alone and called this airline a top pick.

1330,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday said that it should reach flat unit revenue in the first quarter and offered more bullish fourth-quarter guidance, while Barclays said many carriers could offer ""ample upside for patient investors.""Delta's forecast comes after American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) gave more upbeat Q4 unit revenue guidance. The important metric eroded after the 2014 oil crash when carriers expanded flights and reduced airfares in some markets. The stronger dollar has also weighed, while terrorist attacks and political upheaval have kept more people away from traveling.Delta on Thursday said it expected flat passenger unit revenue — or revenue from passengers per available seats flown one mile — in Q1 and reiterated that would cap capacity growth next year at 1%.The company also said it now expects Q4 unit revenue to fall roughly 3%, at the high end of the 3%-5% decline forecast earlier this month. Delta now sees operating margin of 10.5%-11%, up from an earlier outlook for 9.5%-10.5%.""Continued traction"" in close-in domestic yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge more for flights booked closer to takeoff — helped improve revenue trends, Delta said. Domestic unit revenues were expected to be ""roughly flat"" from November through January, the company added.Delta also said that its cabin segmentation — that is, the array of fare and seating classes offered by airlines — increased customer loyalty. The carrier said its domestic rollout of ""basic economy"" seating, its attempts to compete with low-cost carriers, would likely be finished by the middle of 2017.Shares of airlines took off, but they lost some altitude by the closing bell. Delta climbed 1.4% to 50.50 in the stock market today, off intraday highs of 51.74. It's still in buy zone after a breakout last week. American climbed as high as 49.95, selling for a 0.8% advance to 48.30. United settled for a 2.5% gain, JetBlue 1.5%. Alaska Air Group (ALK) surged 4.3% to 90.12, entering profit-taking sell territory after a November breakout. Southwest (LUV) rose 2.7%, climbing just above a buy zone.IBD'S TAKE: The airlines have been on a roll over the past two months, as higher oil prices help the industry tighten up its plans for growth and Warren Buffett, who has long avoided the business, reconsiders it. Meanwhile, Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote that the industry was ""working to reduce volatility"" and appeared to be keeping capacity growth in check. He added that airlines were undervalued, trading near the bottom of the S&P 500, but would remain profitable through the next recession. Barclays' top picks were United, JetBlue and Alaska Air.Oglenski praised United's leadership changes, saying they could help the company ""focus on closing the gap to best in class profitability,"" but said higher labor costs would pose challenges to the carrier next year.He also said Alaska Air's merger with Virgin America would strengthen its presence in New York and Los Angeles.And while JetBlue trades ""at a steep discount to the rest of the airline group despite a profitable growth outlook,"" he said it's poised for greater gains due to its focus on customer service.RELATED:United: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Southwest Airlines Hits Buy Point On Traffic Data; Delta Breaks OutUnited, Southwest See Stronger Ticket Demand During Holidays

1332,ALK,"Stocks are rallying sharply and the Dow Jones industrials are leading the way, surging 1.3% in late afternoon trading on Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite had lagged after President-elect Donald Trump's vow to hold drug prices down boosted skittishness among biotech and ethical-drug investors, but has now quickly joined the broad market advance.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) helped lead a big flurry of gainers within the Dow Jones industrials; as of 2:30pm in New York, at least 17 of the Dow 30 components rose 1 point or more.Apple rose nearly 0.8% to 110.78, getting back above a 110.33 original buy point in a long bottoming base pattern. It's been nearly three months since Apple's Sept. 14 breakout took shares above that proper entry within a cup with handle en route to a nearly 8% gain, so some would argue that that buy point is irrelevant.However, a continued rise past 110.33 and a rebound back above its slightly downward sloping 50-day moving average would go a long way in helping the former tech leader complete a new base and potentially break out again.Watch for potential new breakouts by fellow large caps, including IBM (IBM) (164.76 cup with handle buy point) and AutoZone (AZO) (809.88 entry in a new double bottom with handle).Amgen (AMGN) dropped 3%, hitting its lowest price levels in more than three weeks. Former big winner Biogen (BIIB) slid 2.1% and briefly fell below the ever important 200-day moving average.Yet the sell-off in biotech and ethical drug firms is failing to hamper the Nasdaq composite as the tech-rich index has rebounded into a solid gain of 0.9% with just more than an hour left in the trading session.The NYSE composite is now just slightly ahead, rising almost 1%. The Russell 2000 is up nearly 0.7%.Perhaps helping buoy the U.S. equities market is a strong finish for European equities even after Italy voted a resounding no on former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's proposal to enact structural reforms by bypassing the country's Senate. The German DAX 100 soared 2%, London's FTSE 100 gained 1.8%, and the French CAC 40 advanced 1.4%.Volume has accelerated and is running sharply higher so far on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time on Tuesday.In the U.S. stock market today, top industry-group gainers included steel alloys, consumer-electronics retailing, solar, airlines, agricultural chemicals and chip equipment, all up well more than 1%.In the airline space, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has done well since clearing a 49.84 handle buy point within a long, deep, bottoming base structure. The stock, up more than 2% for the week, has gained 16% since its Nov. 10 breakout, two days after the historic U.S. elections.The handle in Spirit is derived by adding 10 cents to the handle's intraday high of 49.74, set on Oct. 25.Notice how on a daily chart the handle showed tight, downward-slanting price action in mostly dull volume, the right way for a handle to form.Alaska Air (ALK) — fresh from gaining government approval, with conditions, to acquire rival airline Virgin America — gained 1.7% to 86.20.

1333,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday cut its fourth-quarter operating margin forecast and hiked its expected unit costs due to a newly ratified contract with its pilots, but the carrier reported encouraging November results.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) reported traffic that outpaced carrying capacity growth.The news pushed Delta shares up 1.1% to 48.31 on the stock market today, closer to a 50.60 buy point. Southwest (LUV) climbed 1.8% to 47.91, just below a 48.10 buy point after topping that level intraday. American Airlines (AAL) added 0.8%, and United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.2%. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 1.6% to 51.20, but is back below a 51.63 entry point after rising as high as 51.95 earlier.Delta now expects its nonfuel unit costs, including profit sharing, to spike around 10%, well up from the 1%-2% increase forecast when the company reported third-quarter results in October. The carrier expects operating margin of 9.5%-10.5%, down from a forecast of 14%-16% given in October.The earlier outlook, Delta noted then, did not factor in costs from any deal struck with pilots. On Friday, Delta said its new pilot contract included a retroactive adjustment that would be accrued in Q4 for a total cost of $475 million. Excluding the labor deal, operating margin would be at the higher end of the forecast the carrier gave in October, Delta said.Still, the carrier held to its forecast for a 3%-5% drop in passenger unit revenue, a measure of how much money airlines make on passengers compared to available seats and distance traveled. The company said it still expects Q4 capacity to be up around 1%.In November, unit revenue, or sales as they relate to an airline's overall carrying capacity, fell 1%. Capacity dipped 0.7%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose 0.9 percentage points to 85%.The carrier said it ""continued to see stabilization"" of close-in domestic yields, or its ability to make more money on tickets booked closer to a flight's departure time. Positive unit revenue in Latin America also helped, Delta said.Alaska Air Group shares rose 2.4% to 84.83 climbing further above buy range, after the carrier said passenger traffic rose 7% in November, while capacity rose 2.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As low-cost carriers outside the U.S. offer cheaper trans-Atlantic flights, the big U.S. network carriers have tried to find ways to compete. Airlines like Delta, American and United have leaned more toward cheaper fare classes, as opposed to dedicated low-cost airlines of their own.After punishing airlines through much of the year on concerns of overexpansion, Wall Street has taken a more sympathetic approach to the industry. With oil prices rising, investors have been more hopeful that airlines will pare back growth and, in turn, shore up unit revenue. Warren Buffett's recent investments in the big carriers has also helped.RELATED:Ryanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some MarketsAir France's New Budget Carrier May Squeeze Delta, United, AmericanDelta, American, United Price Targets Hiked; FireEye DowngradedDelta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

1334,ALK,"European, Japanese or specialty pharma could look to acquire Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) as it rapidly closes in on U.S. approval of an orphan lung cancer drug, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday.Yee expects Ariad stock to spike in the first half of 2017 as it approaches the Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date on brigatinib, a cancer drug aimed at treating anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib.Crizotinib is a chemotherapy developed by Pfizer (PFE) to treat NSCLC. On Wednesday, Ariad unveiled the results of a phase 2 trial of NSCLC patients resistant to Pfizer's chemo drug. At a median follow-up of 11 months, 55% of patients on a 180-milligram regimen achieved an objective response.Brigatinib increased median progression-free survival (PFS) to 15.6 months from 12.9 months after failed crizotinib therapy. Additionally, in patients whose cancer had metastasized to the brain, 67% showed an intracranial objective response. Intracranial PFS was 18.4 months.IBD'S TAKE: Drug and biotech stocks plunged Wednesday on President-Elect Donald Trump's comments that he would seek to curb drug prices. Check out this deep dive in IBD'S Industry Themes.On average, rivals of brigatinib have extended PFS by eight to 10 months, Yee wrote in a client note. Brigatinib has the potential ""to be a best-in-class second-line (ALK+) lung cancer drug"" and could possibly also be the best first-line defense, he wrote.Ariad's first-line data won't be available until 2018-19, though. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has first-line data for rival drug alectinib due in 2018. In that interim, Yee has plenty of questions for Ariad that could upend its future stock price.""When will Ariad hire a sales force in the spring for brigatinib and does the Street think they'll launch themselves and thus no takeout near-term, or will Ariad be sold before or after the PDUFA?"" he said. ""Does Ariad sell off brigatinib EU rights and thus reduce M&A potential?""Yee also has questions on Ariad's Iclusig, a med to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He questions whether the lack of a 30-mg bottle could limit M&A options.He notes Ariad's $2.6 billion market cap, meaning it wouldn't be a heavy acquisition for a Japanese, European or specialty pharmaceutical company looking to expand its presence in the U.S. Becoming a two-cancer drug company would make Ariad a ""notable scarcity in biotech,"" Yee wrote.Comparable biotechs Exelixis (EXEL), Array BioPharma (ARRY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis (CLVS) all rocketed on major cancer data into or after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, Yee wrote. So, ""it's reasonable to see how Aria will go up, because the chances of M&A also up as we get closer to that FDA approval.""Yee kept his sector perform rating on Ariad stock, but boosted his price target to 14 from 10. He sees M&A valuations around 13-20 per share depending on peak sales of brigatinib and Iclusig. Assuming $500 million to $700 million, he puts a $3 billion to $4 billion valuation on Ariad.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Ariad stock fell 6.8% to 12.76. But most drug stocks were have a tough day after President-Elect Donald Trump told Time magazine he would go after spiraling drug prices.

1337,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said October unit revenue fell in line with expectations, while Alaska Air Group (ALK) reportedly monthly carrying capacity that was roughly in line with its forecasts for the fourth quarter overall.Delta said unit revenue, a key measure that gauges revenue as it relates to available seats and distance flown, fell 6.5% in October.The carrier said it ""continued to see stabilization of close-in domestic yields"" during the month, referring to its ability to get more money from flights arranged closer to their departure. However, Delta said it faced an imbalance of supply and demand in the Transatlantic region, while the timing of certain holidays also weighed on results.Delta had indicated on its third-quarter earnings call that unit revenue was likely to be weak in October.Delta's traffic fell 0.3% for the month, while its carrying capacity rose 1.7%. The company has said it expects fourth-quarter capacity to rise around 1%.Shares rose 0.1% to 41.93 in the stock market today, after closing above the 200-day moving average on Tuesday for the first time since mid-April.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group said traffic rose 5.5%, outpacing a capacity increase of 3.2%.

Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose 1.9 percentage points to 84.2%.Alaska Air stock lost 0.7% to 70.96.

1338,ALK,"American Airlines (AAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) both reported third-quarter results that beat forecasts early Thursday, although American forecast thinner margins for the fourth quarter.American said its adjusted pretax margin in the fourth quarter would be around 4% to 6%, weaker than in prior quarters this year.The carrier also said it expected adjusted mainline unit costs to rise 8%-10% during the fourth quarter and 5%-7% for the entire year, in line with guidance given by the company this month. Those higher costs for the year reflect profit-sharing and the company's recent labor deals with a variety of employees.American said it expected full-year capacity to grow around 1.5%, in line with a forecast given earlier this month.For the third quarter, unit revenue fell 2.2%, while capacity grew 1.2%.The drop in unit revenue ""was due to competitive capacity growth, continued macroeconomic softness outside of the United States, and foreign currency weakness,"" American said.Unit revenue measures revenue as it relates to available seats and distance traveled, while capacity, broadly, measures available seats, flights and distance traveled.Wall Street has called for airlines to improve unit revenue by raising airfares and reining in flight capacity to align with passenger demand. Investors have focused on airlines' forecasts as to when unit revenue might turn positive and when capacity growth will become more restrained after cheap oil made airlines' expansion easier through last year.American's earnings per share fell 36% to $1.76, better than expectations for $1.69, on revenue down 1% $10.59 billion, above views for $10.54 billion.Still, investors showed concern over forecasts, and shares shaved off 4 cents to close at 40.59 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group said it expected fourth-quarter capacity growth of around 3%, far more restrained than in prior quarters. The company sees adjusted unit costs up roughly 0.5% during the fourth quarter.Unit revenue fell 4.4% during the third quarter. Earnings rose 2% to $2.20 a share, whereas analysts had expected a 3% drop to $2.09. Overall revenue climbed 3% to $1.566 billion, just topping views $1.561 billion.The company said it was ""fully focused"" on completing its merger with Virgin America (VA). The Justice Department has lengthened its review of that deal, announced in April, due to competitive concerns.

1340,ALK,"Shares of Virgin America (VA) rallied Monday on hopes that its planned merger with Alaska Air Group (ALK) appeared likely to go through after all despite missing a deadline to do so last week.The rebound in Virgin's stock price comes after media outlets reported late Friday that the deal would ultimately be cleared and likely still close in the fourth quarter, per Alaska Air Group's expectations. The two carriers initially agreed not to complete the deal before Sept. 30, but late last month, that deadline was pushed back to Monday to give regulators more time to review the transaction.Virgin surged 3.4% to 53.85 in the stock market today. Alaska Air fell 0.5% to 71.94, forming the right side of a cup base begun in April.In a report Friday, a source told TheStreet that the deal would not be blocked, but that the conditions of the agreement were not yet clear. Reuters late Friday also reported that Alaska Air Group spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said the carrier was making ""good progress"" in working with the Justice Department in clearing the deal.In September, the two carriers pushed back their planned tie-up to give the agency more time to review the agreement due to anticompetitive concerns.Egan said that ""We will keep talking past Monday,"" according to the TheStreet.""We will continue working with DOJ to use this extra time to work toward closing early in the fourth quarter,"" TheStreet reported Egan as saying.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.United Airlines (UAL) closed down 0.3% to 53.03. After the close, United Airlines topped EPS and revenue forecasts, but shares were little changed in late trading.Meanwhile, budget carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) was virtually unchanged after forecasting improved third-quarter unit revenue.

1341,ALK,"The stock market recovered Thursday after an early downdraft, but it was still a defensive session as growth stocks continued to face selling pressure and utilities outperformed.Stocks fell sharply early as Wall Street turned its attention from the Fed to China.

1342,ALK,"Stocks overcame mild selling pressure at the open and traded nearly break-even in late-morning trade Wednesday. The initial sell-off came amid a negative preannouncement of quarterly results by data network security firm Fortinet (FTNT), bringing down its peers in the software field. Yet Apple (AAPL) rose 0.7% to 117.13 and continued to draw demand in the wake of a colossal failure in one of its rival Samsung's key wireless products and is perhaps offering an additional entry point.Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to defend the 200 level, rising 1% to 202.30 in heavy turnover. Analysts on consensus see the EV maker posting a profit of 8 cents a share in the third quarter despite controversy over whether the company, which plans to merge with SolarCity (SCTY), needs to raise cash in the fourth quarter to keep up with investing for the scheduled rollout of the Model 3 entry-level sedan in late 2017.The Nasdaq composite, down 0.2% at the open, was flatlining while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials edged roughly 0.1% higher. Gains by Apple and fellow Dow 30 components Travelers (TRV), Nike (NKE) and Home Depot (HD) offset the 1-point loss by Chevron (CVX) as crude oil prices retreated 1%.Alibaba (BABA), down 2.9% on Tuesday, sank another 1.2% to 103.91, but the decline appears normal. Notice on a daily chart how the stock still maintains a thick air pocket above its fast-rising 50-day moving average — a sign of strength. The e-commerce behemoth is also still up 22% past an 85.10 entry in a long cup with handle pattern — this means an investor who bought correctly may still take at least some profits at 20% to 25%, which in this long-in-the-tooth bull market run going back years could be considered as executing the ""platinum rule"" of selling right.Also in big cap land, Apple is already extended more than 5% past a 110.33 buy point in a bottoming-style cup with handle that formed from April 15 to Sept. 9. Yet sometimes, stocks can reflect multiple patterns simultaneously, and such is the case with the largest company on the U.S. equity markets.As seen in either a daily or weekly chart, Apple has formed another handle that began with a Sept. 16 pullback, generating an additional pivot point at 116.28 — 10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 116.18.Keep in mind that Apple had peaked with an all-time high of 134.54 back in the spring of 2015. So while there may be some ""overhead supply"" of disgruntled shareholders itching for the stock to rebound so they can close their positions with small losses or at break-even, that price peak is now more than 18 months in the past. This means the price levels carry less psychological relevance for today's traders.Apple's RS Rating continues to improve, now at 76 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup; five weeks ago it was at a lowly 26 out of a maximum 99. A 76 rating means Apple is outperforming 76% of all companies in terms of 12-month price performance within IBD's database.Are there other ""bottoming bases"" in the works? Yes.Alaska Air Group (ALK), which led the airlines during an extraordinary run by the industry group from December 2012 to the start of 2015, rallied 1.2% to 70.16. The highly profitable airline is trying to clear its 200-day moving average for the second time in as many months.Good stocks trade above this long-term support line en route to building a solid base, holding near 52-week or all-time highs, then breaking out to lead the market and produce tradable rallies. Alaska Air holds a poor 36 RS Rating for now, but watch to see if it improves over the next few months.Last week, Alaska reported a 7.4% jump in September revenue passenger miles despite a dip in the load factor -- a gauge of how full are planes -- to 81.6% vs. 84.1% a year ago. The revenue passenger count rose 5.4% while capacity in the form of available seat miles grew 4.2%.Wall Street sees Q3 earnings down 4% to $2.08 a share; the estimate incorporates a tough year-over-year comp as Q3 profit jumped 47% in the year-ago quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Want to master how to time purchases of excellent growth stocks to maximize potential gains?

1343,ALK,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday said Hurricane Matthew was likely to gouge unit revenue and costs during the fourth quarter, and the carrier reported mixed third-quarter results.The airline expect unit revenue for October to be down around 3.5%-4%, including a roughly 2-percentage-point impact from Hurricane Matthew.The storm affected October's unit revenue because it hit during the only travel peak during the month, JetBlue said on its third-quarter earnings call. However, the carrier said it has seen more strength in close-in bookings — or tickets booked closer to a flight's departure time — in recent weeks.JetBlue said unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing was likely to rise 4.5%-6.5%, with Hurricane Matthew adding ""approximately half a point"" to the increase. The company held to its full-year adjust unit cost guidance of flat to 1.5% growth.For the rest of the fourth quarter, JetBlue said it expected December's unit revenue to be the weakest for the three months during the quarter, due in part to the ""unfavorable Christmas calendar placement this year.""JetBlue said it expects fourth-quarter carrying capacity to rise 3%-5%, with full-year capacity up 8.5%-9%. In July, JetBlue forecast a 8%-9.5% capacity expansion for the year.The industry this quarter has been making strides at curbing capacity growth, which has spurred big cuts in fares last year and tanked unit revenue, which measures an airline's revenue as it relates to its overall flight capacity.Larger carriers have largely topped earnings forecasts, including Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Alaska Air (ALK).JetBlue said it expects to take delivery of five Airbus (EADSY) A321 aircraft during the fourth quarter, with one of those configured for its premium Mint seating class, which offers lie-flat seats and faster check-in and boarding, among other things.JetBlue's recently revised purchase deal with Airbus would allow it to add 30 more A321s, some of which would offer the Mint service, over seven years. That deal also gives JetBlue the option to use a long-haul version of the jet that could, perhaps, allow it to offer flights to Europe.No decision on whether to actually offer flights to the Continent has been made publicly, and the matter did not come up during the earnings call on Tuesday. CEO Robin Hayes told the Wall Street Journal in July that JetBlue must decide by late next year if it wants the long-range plane, which could hit the market in 2019, the Journal said then.IBD'S TAKE: While JetBlue may or may not offer flights to Europe, transatlantic competition between the large U.S. network carriers and low-cost European carriers is heating up. To keep apace, Delta is weighing a variety of options. For the third quarter, the carrier reported mixed third-quarter results. Earnings per share of 58 cents were flat vs. a year earlier, missing estimates for 60 cents. Revenue rose 2.6% to $1.732 billion, just past expectations for $1.724 billion.Passenger unit revenue in the third quarter fell 4.7%; operating unit revenue fell 3.5%, better than in the second quarter.Shares closed down 3.6% to 18.07 in the stock market today, after briefly swinging to a gain earlier in the day.Meanwhile, low-fare, high-fee carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said third-quarter total unit revenue fell 7%, an improvement from the second quarter. Q3's drop reflected a ""decrease in passenger yield as a result of industry competitive pricing pressures.""""Although yields decreased year over year, throughout the third quarter 2016, the Company saw sequential improvement in the rate of decline,"" Spirit said.Capacity rose 16.2%, showing more restraint than in Q2. Earnings per share fell 13.3% to $1.17, matching estimates, while revenue rose 8.1% to $621.3 million, topping estimates.Spirit Airlines stock rose 3.9% to 48.66.IBD's airline industry group has been climbing quickly. It ranked No. 36, up from No. 164 just three weeks ago.RELATED:Get Ready For A New Era Of Higher AirfaresUnited Sees Unit Revenue Improving In Q4 But Labor Pact To Lift CostsAmerican Airlines Sees Thinner Margins, Alaska Air Trims Capacity
"
1344,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday said consolidated passenger unit-revenue in September improved from the quarter's prior two months, and the carrier said adjusted unit costs for the third quarter were likely better than anticipated.The month's results come as third-quarter earnings season looms for the airline industry. The industry for some two years has contended with falling unit revenue, which measures revenue from passengers as it relates to available seats on flights and distance traveled.The numbers also cap a quarter in which Delta and other airlines dealt with concerns over terrorism, the Zika virus and their own technology. Delta Air Lines had to cancel 2,300 flights in August after a small fire at a power switch caused a massive outage. Southwest Airlines' (LUV) third-quarter unit-revenue forecast also took a hit after an outage prompted the cancellations of some 2,000 flights in July.Delta on Tuesday said September consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 3%. The company said ""close-in domestic yield pressures moderated slightly with the implementation of lower Fall capacity levels."" Delta also said it continues to deal with ""a supply-demand imbalance"" in the trans-Atlantic region.Investors have wanted airlines to rein in flight-capacity growth to align more with demand. Expansion and fare competition during the cheap-oil boom, along with a stronger dollar that has hurt international demand, have weighed on unit revenue.At the beginning of the quarter, a 7% unit-revenue drop in July made some investors wonder if Delta could hit the unit-revenue target it gave when it reported second-quarter earnings. Then the outage, in part, brought a 9.5% drop in August.But Delta on Tuesday said ""cost discipline and productivity efforts"" enabled it to deal with cost issues associated with the outage. Delta said it expects unit costs excluding some expenses to be roughly flat for the third quarter, compared with an earlier forecast for ""flat to up 1%.""The company on Tuesday also stuck with its third-quarter unit-revenue forecast -- a decline around 7%, with around 1 percentage point of that coming from the outage. In July, Delta had forecast a Q3 unit-revenue decline of 4%-6%.The company said carrying capacity likely rose around 1.5% during the quarter, with operating margin at 18%-19%. Those forecasts were also in line with guidance given last month.Passenger traffic during September rose 1.4%, with capacity up 1.8%, Delta said.Delta shares ended the trading day up 0.4% to 40.15 on the stock market today, still well off 52-week highs.United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) also got an early boost from the numbers. United Airlines rose 0.9% to 53.73 while American Airlines reversed to trade down 0.2% to 37.63.Southwest fell 1.5% 39.16.Recent labor pacts with other airlines could upend Southwest's less-generous tentative pact with its pilots. Delta on Friday announced an agreement in principle with its pilots union for a pay raise that was higher than the one negotiated at Southwest, Southwest's union said, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year. For more, read this story. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group's (ALK) passenger-traffic growth outpaced its capacity expansions for the month.

1346,ALK,"Here's your weekly review of the week's key business and investment news.Stocks were up and down, though Apple (AAPL) continued to rally on Samsung woes. Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO John Stumpf is out even as Wells and other big banks topped earnings forecasts.The major averages dipped amid concerns over China, the Fed and profit-selling in hot groups. The Nasdaq fell 1.5%, falling below its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Dow have largely traded below that key support line over the past month. Market-leading fiber optics and chips were among the big losers. Apple, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and airlines were winners. Treasury yields continued to rise.Several Federal Reserve policymakers wanted to raise rates ""relatively soon"" during the September FOMC meeting, according to newly released minutes. At that meeting, 3 voting members favored an immediate hike. The odds of a December rate hike have steadily increased, though there is plenty of time and data before then. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 0.6% in September, with nonauto sales climbing 0.5%.Wells Fargo's John Stumpf abruptly resigned Wednesday night as CEO and chairman in the wake of the bank's cross-selling scandal. Wells Fargo on Friday reported lower earnings and sales, but topped forecasts. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) also topped forecasts. All three stocks fell roughly 1% for the week.RELATED:Wells Fargo, Citigroup Beat; JPMorgan Tops, Probes Cross SellingU.S. crude oil prices rose to a 15-month closing high during the week, but faded to $50.35 a barrel on Friday. Still, oil prices rose for a fourth straight week, up 1.1%. Oil markets could rebalance in early 2017 if OPEC sticks to its production cap according to the International Energy Agency. But Goldman Sachs warned that failure to keep the deal would send oil down to $43. OPEC oil production jumped by 220,000 barrels per day in September, from August's rate of 33.39 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. oil inventories surged by 4.85 million barrels in the prior week, well above the 300,000-barrel increase analysts expected. But gasoline supplies fell. U.S. crude production dipped 0.2%.Diamondback Energy (FANG) raised its 2016 production guidance and sees 2017 production up 30% vs. its updated 2016 expectations. Diamondback said it had been in acquisition talks, but no longer. Diamondback had been reported near a deal for Permian Basin-heavy Silver Hill Energy Partners, which on Thursday agreed to a $2.4 billion sale to RSP Permian (RSPP). Diamond stock rose nearly 7% for the week, hitting a record high.Extraction Oil & Gas (XOG)  became the first exploration and production company to go public in two years and rallied 15% in its trading debut. The company raised net proceeds of $594.1 million after offering 33.3 million shares, priced at 19 each, above the 15-18 range expected.Ulta Beauty raised its third-quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings estimates and predicted growth in the low 20s percentage range for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Ulta said only one-tenth of its online sales come from online-only shoppers, meaning that most still manage to find a way into a brick-and-mortar Ulta store, even if they're able to order items online. That may explain why Ulta is Amazon-resistant.Ulta Beauty shares soared 11% on Thursday, rebounding above their 50-day line for the first time since August, when Ulta gave slightly cautious earnings guidance.Delta Air Lines (DAL) forecast improved unit revenue for the fourth quarter and tighter capacity growth in 2017, while suggesting it would take a closer look at ways to compete internationally with low-cost carriers in Europe. American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), which report next week, and Alaska Air Group (ALK) also got a lift from guidance that indicated more operational discipline after concerns about overexpansion. Solid monthly traffic results also came from Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE).RELATED:Delta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

Amazon plans to develop convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations. The efforts could add billions in revenue to the e-commerce giant, says Pacific Crest Securities.Samsung discontinued production and sale of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after a botched recall for the device, which is prone to overheating batteries and fires. Wall Street analysts said Apple is likely to attract more iPhone customers because of Samsung's public relations disaster. Apple shares rallied as Samsung struggled with how to handle the fiasco. The South Korea consumer electronics firm is now offering cash rebates with trade-ins of Note 7 phones to keep customers loyal.Fortinet (FTNT) warned that it would miss Q3 consensus estimates, sending several security stocks lower. Security software stocks with exposure to the corporate ""firewall"" market, such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Check Point (CHKP),  fell the most amid worries over price competition intensifying amid a shift to outsource to the internet cloud. Firewalls sit between private networks and the internet and block unauthorized traffic. Barracuda (CUDA) reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped views. Proofpoint (PFPT) reports earnings on Oct. 20.Twilio stock plunged after the communications software provider filed to make a secondary stock offering, although it preannounced Q3 revenue above Wall Street consensus estimates and forecast a smaller-than-expected loss. In the offering, Twilio will sell $50 million in stock and existing shareholders will sell a still-undisclosed amount. Mercadolibre (MELI) fell 8% Thursday after announcing plans to sell stock on behalf of eBay (EBAY).Gene-sequencer Illumina late Monday preannounced a big miss for its Q3 revenue, and gave a weak Q4 forecast. Shares plunged 25% the next day, to a five-month low. That follows big warnings on Q3 2015 and Q1 2016. Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro didn't help Illumina's cause when he said that after speaking with Illumina executives, they were ""still searching for answers to explain the miss."" He said a delayedsale of its high-end HiSeq X5 or X10 genome-sequencing system, likely to a China customer was one reason. These systems can cost $1 million-plus, so the sales cycles are long, often longer than expected. U.S. sales of the company's 2500/4000 line also drove the miss, says Massaro, who calls the weak U.S. outlook ""troubling.""The aluminum giant's Q3 EPS rose 52% to 32 cents, missing forecasts by 3 cents, as revenue dipped 6% to $5.21 billion, below expectations for $5.31 billion. Alcoa (AA) cited weakness in its performance materials business, which will be spun off as a separate publicly traded company next month. Revenue at what will be known as Arconic, which provides engineering and manufacturing services to the aerospace, automobile and commercial transportation markets, slipped 1% in Q3 to $3.4 billion, though after-tax operating profit rose 4% to $267 million. Alcoa shares plunged nearly 16% for the week, diving below their 50- and 200-day averages.

1347,ALK,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) forecast third-quarter unit revenue that was better than the prior two quarters, making the company the latest airline to signal improvement in the key metric.In an investor update dated Tuesday, the carrier forecast a unit-revenue drop of 4.5%, stronger than the second quarter's 6.4% slide and a first-quarter decrease of 6.1%. The company also forecast slightly lower unit costs.Unit revenue measures an airline's revenue in relation to flight capacity. It has fallen after airlines aggressively expanded during the oil crash.Meanwhile, JetBlue (JBLU) on Wednesday reported improved preliminary unit revenue for September but held to its third-quarter unit revenue forecast for a 3%-4% decline.Preliminary unit revenue for the month fell around 2%, JetBlue said, compared to a roughly 5.5% drop in August. Traffic in September rose 10.8%, outpacing capacity growth of 7.9%.Shares of Alaska Air Group rose 1.6% to 70.43 on the stock market today, emerging above their 200-day line.JetBlue fell 0.5% to 17.79 after rising as high as 18.29 intraday. JetBlue has been trying to regain its 200-day line after finding support at the 50-day line through much of September. JetBlue reports third-quarter results on Oct. 25.The figures from Alaska and JetBlue come after more upbeat forecasts issued Tuesday from American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on Tuesday also reported traffic growth in September that outpaced capacity growth.Wall Street has wanted airlines to align their flight capacity with passenger demand, hoping that doing so would keep unit revenue from falling.IBD'S TAKE: With concerns related to terrorism, the Zika virus and capacity, most airline stocks have had a bumpy ride this summer and haven't had a chance to form bases from which to break out. Things could be a bit better in the medical sector.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports third-quarter results on Thursday, said that its executive chairman, Richard Anderson, was retiring, effective today after nearly 10 years on Delta's board.Lead director Francis Blake, a former chief executive of The Home Depot (HD) will succeed Anderson's as nonexecutive chairman, Delta said.Delta Air shares rose 0.85% to 39.27.American Air lost 2.2% to 37.37 and United Airlines 1.2% to 52.88.Stifel reiterated its buy rating on American Airlines, but cut its price target to 45 from 50. Imperial Capital maintained its outperform rating on United and raised its price target to 63 from 57.RELATED:Virgin Extends Drop As Alaska Air Merger Review Grows LongerUnited Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

1348,ALK,"Shares of Virgin America (VA) sank Thursday after reports of antitrust concerns and labor unease earlier in the week suggested the airline's acquisition by Alaska Air Group (ALK) could get complicated.The two carriers met last week with a top U.S. antitrust official and others in an attempt to respond to worries about the threat the merger might pose to competition, Bloomberg reported. It cited a source with knowledge of the situation. The meeting may have indicated that regulators were concerned about the deal and could try to halt it, Bloomberg said.On Monday, the Transport Workers Union of America said Virgin's flight attendants rejected a tentative contract agreement between their union and Virgin. The contract was set to take hold at the merger deal's closing, which Alaska in July said it expects to happen in this year's fourth quarter.The flight attendants in the combined company would eventually be represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, the representative for Alaska, according to the Seattle Times.AFA Alaska on its website said Monday that the vote ""raises questions about what happens next"" but that they ""stand in unity with our Virgin America sisters and brothers as they fight for improvements to their wages and working conditions.""The union representing Virgin's flight attendants said it would discuss the vote with Virgin's management.""Our in-flight teammates have spoken,"" a Virgin America spokesman said, the Puget Sound Business Journal reported late Tuesday. He added: ""We are now turning our attention to our anticipated merger with Alaska Airlines, and we will be discussing next steps connected to the merger with the TWU.""Virgin America shares closed down 4.4% at 53.20 in the stock market today, but had fallen as low as 50.66 earlier in the day, marking the biggest movement in its shares since agreeing in April to be taken over for $57 a share, or $2.6 billion. Alaska shares slipped 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Virgin's labor negotiations come as other U.S. carriers have more recently worked out deals with workers after cheap oil created an industry profit windfall through 2015. Analysts, however, warn such deals could hurt profits.Shares of rival JetBlue (JBLU) rose 0.6%, and discount carrier Southwest (LUV) gained 1.1%. Ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) added 0.65%.RELATED:American Airlines Seen More Aggressively Cutting Buybacks In 2017

1349,ALK,"Stocks rebounded in the final minutes yet still dropped across the board Tuesday, led by a summary sell-off in the mining sector.A sharp fall in both gold and silver prices shook investors and likely stemmed from continued strength in the U.S. dollar and growing expectation of a rise in U.S. short-term interest rates after the November presidential election. The British pound notched new multiyear lows as it appears Britain is making progress toward an exit of the EU early next year.The S&P 500 led the decline with a 0.5% loss; the Dow Jones industrials sank almost 0.5%. Gains in Chinese internet and some telecom infrastructure-related names helped buffer the Nasdaq composite's 0.2% drop.Volume jumped higher on both exchanges, according to preliminary figures, spelling a potential fourth day of distribution for the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 likely now has eight distribution days, or bouts of severe institutional selling, but one of those is suspect as the large-cap index's 0.4% decline on Sept. 16 came on quadruple witching day in which options and single stock futures expired.Many of the gold mining plays that led the first half of 2016 took a pounding, falling 6% to 10% or more. Randgold (GOLD) gapped lower, falling more than 8% to 90.73 and cutting through its 200-day moving average, which is typically a late sell signal.A much earlier sell signal arrived in mid-August as Randgold clipped its 50-day line and failed to rebound back above it. At its peak of 126.55, Randgold stood 75% above a 72.17 bottoming-base breakout point.Gold futures shed 3% to $1,271 an ounce, while silver slipped more than 5% to $17.84 an ounce, a three-month low.Among stocks on the upside today, top new discount retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) gapped up on news that it's being added to the S&P SmallCap 600 after Wednesday's session. The retailer is growing rapidly in both store count, sales and earnings, and gets a solid 88 Relative Strength Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Ollie's on July 19 cleared a 26.65 double-bottom buy point, but rallied only 7% before getting reeled back into the base. The stock has had trouble cracking through upside resistance near 28.Wall Street expects the seller with the motto ""Good Stuff Cheap"" to post a 34% increase in fiscal 2017 profit to 90 cents a share on a 16% boost in sales to $884 million.Ollie's sports a mediocre 79 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, yet that belies an excellent EPS Rating (97). One of the major problems is that the Retail-Discount & Variety industry subgroup has become a cellar dweller within IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups, currently at 189th in terms of six-month relative price performance. Prefer stocks that rank within the top 40.Money center banks edged higher as the prospects of a single hike in short-term interest rates in December continues to grow.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose slightly to 66.65, just pennies above a 66.58 buy point within a long, choppy cup with handle. The lending and investment banking titan has been hugging its 50-day moving average, a sign of buying support among fund managers.Sponsorship among mutual funds and hedge funds in JPMorgan stock has been on the wane. At the end of the June quarter, 3,713 funds owned shares, down from 3,815 in the third quarter of 2015. One would prefer to see fund sponsorship grow, not decline. That's the case with Bank of Montreal (BMO), which saw fund owners expand from 1,017 to 1,124 over the same time frame. BMO shares, however, dropped more than 2% and sank below the 50-day moving average. The Canadian economy is powered in large part by mining and other natural resources industries.Leading groups on Tuesday included the super regional banks (up more than 1%) and banks located in the West and Southwest, up less than 0.5%. Airlines also rallied more than 1% as a group. Hawaiian Holdings (HA) broke out of a 5-1/2-month long cup with handle with a 49.85 pivot point, rising 1% to 50.75 in fast trading. The 5% chase zone extends up to 52.34.Hawaiian, which will report Q3 results after the close on Oct. 18, gained on the back of strong monthly operating stats from fellow group leader Alaska Air (ALK).One could argue that the Hawaiian Airlines parent also had cleared an earlier handle entry at 47.02 during a low-volume rally that began in late August to early September. Turnover popped mildly above average in the following weeks, then grew nearly 70% above average on Tuesday, a good sign.Travel-related stocks have done reasonably well even though gasoline and oil prices have been climbing. Priceline Group (PCLN) notched an all-time high of 1,498 in rising fractionally in light volume. The online travel booking giant is extended more than 6% past a 1,394.10 buy point.RELATED:Why The Airlines Flew Higher TodayWhen Did Gold Miners Start Showing Signs Of Cooling?

1350,ALK,"Virgin America (VA) shares continued their descent Friday after the carrier and Alaska Air Group (ALK) reportedly pushed back their planned tie-up to allow for a lengthier regulatory review from the Justice Department.The postponement, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing a source with knowledge of the situation, gives antitrust regulators several weeks extra to evaluate the $2.6 billion merger. Alaska has said it expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter.Virgin America rose 1.6% to 54.05 in the stock market today after sinking as low as 51.40 intraday. Virgin fell 4.4% on Thursday, when Bloomberg first reported that cracks in the merger deal had possibly begun to form due to concerns the agreement would harm competition. Alaska Air Group fell 0.4%.On April 4, when the deal was announced, shares spiked nearly 42%, but had done essentially nothing until Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: The wave of airline-industry consolidation over the past decade helped restrain overexpansion. But global turmoil and unit-revenue and capacity concerns continue to batter the industry. Hawaiian Holdings, the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, continues to be within buy range of a 47.02 entry, however, and some bigger players have shown signs of better operational discipline. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a note dated Thursday, had expressed optimism that the merger would still go through.""While any airline consolidation would likely be scrutinized heavily following the legacy consolidation phase, we believe that due to limited overlap and relatively small market share that does not significantly alter control of the industry, the merger should still close accordingly,"" she wrote.""Further,"" she said, ""neither Virgin America nor Alaska has a demonstrated predatory pricing even in markets with dominant positions.""RELATED:American Airlines Seen More Aggressively Cutting Buybacks In 2017This Airline May Beat Delta, United, American To Revenue Recovery

1353,ALK,"JetBlue's (JBLU) plans to expand its cross-country premium Mint service with additional Airbus (EADSY) jets could also allow it to start offering flights to Europe.CEO Robin Hayes said on the carrier's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the Airbus agreement would allow it to fly to Europe from the East Coast, ""should we choose to do so.""The remarks came after Hayes told the Wall Street Journal that JetBlue was contemplating adding flights to European destinations. Hayes said trans-Atlantic flights ""suffer from the same lack of competition and high fares"" as transcontinental flights, according to the newspaper.JetBlue said the revised purchase deal with Airbus would add 30 more A321 jets -- with at least a handful to be outfitted with the Mint service -- over seven years. Hayes also told the Journal that JetBlue must decide by late next year if it wants long-haul versions of the plane that could fly to Europe.Shares of JetBlue jumped 8% to close at 18.67 in the stock market today. Shares of the big three U.S. carriers, which offer cross-country and trans-Atlantic flights, finished higher. Delta Air Lines (DAL) edged up 0.2%, United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.8%, and American Airlines (AAL) added 2.1%. U.S.-listed Airbus shares rallied 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines stocks have had a mixed performance this earnings season. Compare and contrast JetBlue with larger rivals in IBD Stock Checkup. Mint, which debuted in 2014, offers lie-flat seats, in-flight entertainment and other amenities. Unit revenue on Mint routes has jumped by more than 20% since 2014, the company said.The carrier hopes the agreement for additional Airbus planes will help it compete in the transcontinental market, which it said was ""waiting for disruption"" and ""continues to suffer from inferior service and high prices.""The carrier also hopes the additional aircraft will strengthen its position on the West Coast. It comes as Alaska Air Group's (ALK) agreement in April to buy Virgin America (VA) gives the Seattle-based carrier a stronger West Coast presence, prompting JetBlue said it would to step up its coast-to-coast offerings of Mint flights.Meanwhile, JetBlue's Q2 results were mixed. Earnings per share jumped 20% to 53 cents, topping estimates by 4 cents. Total revenue rose around 2% to $1.64 billion, below analysts' forecasts for $1.65 billion.Passenger unit revenue, or the average amount of money an airline makes per passenger flown one mile, sank 10.5%. Yield per passenger mile, a measure of an airline's ability to charge more for tickets, fell 9.9%.Measures of unit revenue have been hurt by industrywide fare discounting, which comes after two years of cheaper oil have made it easier for airlines to spend more of their money on expansion.Passenger traffic grew 10.3%, while flight capacity rose 11.1%. As a result, the company said, load factor, or how effectively an airline fills seats, edged down to 85%.The carrier said its Q3 capacity would likely rise 5.5%-7.5%, and that it continued to expect full-year capacity to rise 8.0%-9.5%. Investors have wanted airlines to temper their capacity growth to keep it more attuned to actual demand.Unit costs, excluding fuel prices and profit sharing, would likely rise between 1%-3% for Q3, JetBlue said as it kept to its forecast for flat to 1.5% growth for the full year.
"
1354,ALK,"United Airlines (UAL) on Wednesday said it expected transatlantic flight capacity to be down 1%-2% in the fourth quarter, and the company said weaker pricing for corporate travel and global uncertainty could restrain seating supply for the rest of the year.The capacity forecast for the region, included in a slide presentation, came a day after the carrier said it would reduce U.S. flights to the U.K. this winter, partly due to the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union. Delta Air Lines (DAL) also cut its fourth-quarter flight capacity outlook to 1% growth, partly due to the Brexit vote.The vote initially shocked world markets and has left the U.K.'s business relationship with the rest of Europe up in the air. United's presentation said the company was monitoring the effects of Brexit and would ""adjust accordingly.""United expects overall fourth-quarter capacity growth of 1%-2%, partly due to lower GDP estimates for the period. In addition, the carrier expects ""further softening"" of its ability to charge corporate travelers more to travel for the rest of the year, Chief Revenue Officer Jim Compton said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday.In reporting second-quarter earnings late Tuesday, the carrier cut its full-year capacity growth outlook to 1%-1.5% growth.United Airlines shares rose slightly less than 1% to 48.30 on the stock market today after the company topped Wall Street's estimates for the quarter. Delta lost 0.8% to 40.21. American Airlines (AAL), the other big global U.S. carrier, dipped 0.3% to 35.92. American reports later this week, with its Q2 earnings call on Friday.Investors have been hoping airlines would work harder to keep flight capacity more in line with passenger demand after last year's cheap-oil windfall allowed more room for profits and inspired aggressive industrywide expansion.IBD'S TAKE: United Airlines, Delta Air and American Airlines face headwinds from a weak European economy, terror fears and other global fears. Domestic-focused carriers Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Holdings tend to have better ratings. Review the entire fleet of airline stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.United on Wednesday also said it expected adjusted unit costs for the year to rise between 2%-3%, reflecting extra expenses from labor deals.The company has struggled to keep up with Delta and American. United CEO Oscar Munoz said Wednesday that ""we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing from a financial perspective to the level of our and your expectations.""Delta has said it would remain dedicated to turning around unit revenue, a key measure of an airline's financial performance, by year-end. United has been less committed to a specific target.Munoz on Wednesday said the company acknowledged ""the importance of returning to positive unit revenue"" and how its capacity plans affect the metric, which measures sales per passenger as it relates to available flight seating and distance traveled.""However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization of sustainable earnings is maintained,"" he said during the call. ""At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best-performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive.""On Thursday, domestic-focused Southwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) report earnings. Southwest stock fell 1.6% to 42.03, Alaska rose 0.6% to 63.49 and Hawaiian climbed 0.5% to 43.76.
"
1355,ALK,"Shares of global carriers Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped Tuesday after German carrier Lufthansa warned on passenger volumes and Delta reported a 7% dive in July unit revenue.The Atlanta-based carrier blamed the July weakness to currency swings, excess capacity on trans-Atlantic flights, and low fares for last-minute bookings. Capacity rose 2.1% during the month, outpacing a passenger-traffic increase of 1.2%.Meanwhile, Lufthansa warned recent terror attacks in Europe and heightened global distress had caused ""a tangible impact on passenger volumes."" CEO Carsten Spohr said in a first-half earnings release that ""our industry has to prepare for a difficult second half-year.""""The terrorist attacks in Europe and also the increasing political and economic uncertainties are having a tangible impact on passenger volumes,"" he added. ""The forward bookings, in particular for our long-haul services to Europe have declined significantly. We expect the high pricing pressure to continue.""Delta plunged 7.8%, while American tumbled 5.9% and United lost 6.25% on the stock market today. The big three U.S. network carriers offer flights to Europe and collaborate with European airlines, but recent violence and upheaval around the world has made passengers more reluctant to fly. JetBlue (JBLU), which is considering offering flights to Europe, sank 6.5%.The share-price drop extended Delta's journey below its 50-day line, and it pushed American and United closer to the key test of investor support.IBD'S TAKE: Domestic-focused carriers like Southwest and Alaska Air have been less exposed but not immune to the global unrest affecting travel demand. Compare the industry's big names at IBD's Stock Checkup. Lufthansa said it expects unit revenue excluding currency fluctuations will drop 8%-9% in the second half of the year, and the company cut its planned flight capacity growth to 5.4% from 6%.Unit revenue gauges how much money an airline makes compared to available seating capacity and distance traveled, and is considered a key measure of how efficiently an airline is operating.Along with the violence, the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the European Union has also raised concerns about foreign exchange difficulties as well as the U.S. airlines' ""open skies"" agreements in the region and other potential business restrictions.Delta and United took a more cautious approach toward Brexit, with plans to cut flight capacity to the U.K. American, however, was a bit more upbeat, saying that in short-term, the planned separation might cause more corporate travel as businesses try to find their footing in a post-Brexit world.United and American got a boost this earnings season on tighter capacity discipline and improving unit revenue trends. American's shares were also helped by a credit-card deal expected to generate more pretax income over the next two-or-so years.Investors have wanted airlines to pare back capacity growth to be in line with passenger demand. More aggressive expansion and competition between airlines stateside has caused airfare prices to drop, hurting unit revenue.Alaska Air Group (ALK), meanwhile, said traffic increased 7.8%, compared to a capacity increase of 9.6%.Alaska shares fell 4.1%.

1356,ALK,"Gulf carrier Qatar Airways said it would take up to a 10% stake in Latam Airlines Group (LFL), a move that rivals big international investments made by competitors Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).Qatar Airways announced the planned $613 million purchase at the Farnborough Airshow. The carrier also has a 15.7% stake in British Airways owner IAG SA, according to Bloomberg.Shares of Latam spiked as much as 28% on the news but had pulled back to close up 10.4% on the stock market today. Airlines stocks rose Tuesday after a better-than-expected second-quarter forecast from United. Delta climbed 5.5%, American 11.2%, and United 8.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Latam shares broke out from a cup base and are in buy range. Find out more about IBD's buying and selling rules.Qatar Airways, American, Latam and British Airways are part of the Oneworld alliance, a group intended to facilitate international travel. Within Latin America, Delta owns much of Aeromexico, while United has a stake in Brazilian carrier Azul. Delta also has a minority stake in Brazilian airline Gol Linhas (GOL).Qatar Airways' announcement comes at a sensitive time for Gulf carriers and the big three U.S. airlines, who have accused their overseas rivals of getting piles of funding from their governments that allows them to engage in unfair competition.The State Department plans to hold ""informal, technical discussions"" this month with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the Journal said, the U.S. was not planning to restrict flights from Gulf carriers or modify existing ""open skies"" agreements, as the big three U.S. airlines want.Smaller carriers such as JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) worry that such changes could hurt competition.
"
1357,ALK,"Southwest (LUV) on Friday said second-quarter operating unit revenue increased less than 1%, but it added that passenger traffic growth of 6% during the quarter outpaced flight-capacity growth of 4.8%.The Dallas-based carrier had said last month it expected a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, an important industry metric used to assess an airline's efficiency that measures revenue per passenger as it relates to available seats. The results come ahead of earnings season for the industry, and amid questions over how efficiently -- and profitably -- airlines can run their businesses without the aid of low fuel costs.Cheap oil last year helped prop up earnings and inspired a wave of industry expansion, competition and cuts in some ticket prices. But corporate and leisure travel demand have not always risen in tandem. Investors have wanted airlines to raise fares and keep capacity in line with passenger demand to improve unit revenue amid signs that oil might not be so cheap in the future.Delta Air Lines (DAL) this week said it expected fuel costs in the second quarter to be around $1.95 to $2.00 per gallon on average, well above the $1.48-$1.53 range it forecast in April. The company said it expected second-quarter operating margin, unit revenue and capacity that would be worse than prior guidance. Delta will hold a conference call to discuss results on Thursday.Southwest shares gained 1.7% in the stock market today, clawing their way back up toward their 50-day line. Delta climbed 2.75%, while American Airlines (AAL) was up 2.2%, and United Airlines (UAL) surged 3.5%.Airline stocks have spent much of the past two months below their key 50-day lines, which have crossed below their 200-day lines, a bearish sign.Southwest's traffic during June rose 6.8%, while capacity increased 5.4%, and load factor -- a metric that gauges seats filled -- crept up to 87.4%.Southwest's results came a day after Hawaiian Holdings (HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines said it expected a 7.1% increase in traffic during the second quarter, compared to a 2.5% rise in capacity. Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) also reported monthly traffic results this week.Credit Suisse this week downgraded American and United and said declines in unit revenue for the big three airlines might not find a bottom until late next year. The firm expects more expensive fuel, labor deals, the stronger dollar and the uncertainty following the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union to dent their results.""Until unit revenues show firm evidence of improvement, which requires capacity discipline or a macro reacceleration, the disillusion with owning airlines will persist, with rallies limited to those led by risk-on appetites instead of improving fundamentals,"" the firm said.Southwest, however, remained its top pick.
"
1358,ALK,"Southwest (LUV) missed second-quarter expectations and forecast its first unit-revenue decline for the year, while warnings from European carriers on the effects of recent terror attacks weighed on Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Southwest's Q2 earnings per share rose 15.5% to 1.19, missing estimates by 2 cents. Revenue rose 5% to $5.38 billion, shy of views for $5.405 billion. Traffic growth of 6% outpaced capacity growth of 4.8%, leading to a unit revenue gain of 0.6%.But the discount carrier expects Q3 unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to an airline's carrying capacity, to fall 3%-4%. That's worse than consensus for a 1.3% drop, according to a research note from Cowen.""While solid traffic demand has continued into July, thus far, the fare environment remains challenging, and close-in yields have softened in recent weeks,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement, referring to an airline's ability to charge more for tickets booked closer to a flight's departure.Shares plunged 11.2% on the stock market today, diving below their 50-day average. A computer glitch Wednesday also forced Southwest to cancel flights, but it has since been fixed. United lost 3.4%, Delta dropped 4.2%, and American retreated by 2.7%. European carriers Lufthansa and easyJet said Thursday that terror attacks in the region and international upheaval were likely to discourage travel.IBD'S TAKE: Southwest and other domestic-focused carriers have been more insulated from the international troubles faced by its bigger network rivals. But low fares continue to affect fundamentals. See how Southwest and rivals stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. Southwest also said it expected unit costs to rise around 2% for Q3 and roughly 1% for the full year.Southwest began offering more flights after federal limits on its Love Field hub in Dallas expired in 2014. But as oil prices crashed that year, the big three network carriers and low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) also stepped up flight coverage, creating a competitive, lower-fare landscape that weighed on unit revenue.On Tuesday, Spirit warned on its Q2 unit revenue, citing ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period.""Southwest noted Thursday that Q3 comparison will be more difficult as its co-branded credit card agreement JPMorgan Chase (JPM) went into effect a year earlier. American Airlines recently forecast a $1.55 billion pretax income boost over the next 2-1/2 years from a similar deal with Citigroup (C), Mastercard (MA) and Barclays (BCS).Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said earnings per share jumped 20% to $2.12, topping analyst forecasts. Total revenue rose 4% to $1.494 billion; analysts expected $1.498 billion.Alaska Air Group agreed in April to buy Virgin America (VA) to strengthen its West Coast presence.Alaska Air stock climbed 1.9%.Hawaiian Holdings (HA), the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, closed down 0.6%. After the market close, Hawaiian rose modestly after reporting Q2 EPS of $1.21 on revenue of $594 million. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $591 million.American reports earnings on Friday.

"
1360,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday forecast far higher second-quarter fuel costs, slashed its operating margin outlook, and said Q2 unit revenue likely fell around 5%, worse than an April forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% decline.The carrier also said that consolidated unit revenue fell 5% in June, citing in part continued foreign exchange pressures.Delta now expects Q2 average fuel prices per gallon of $1.95-$2.00, around 50 cents more than its forecast three months ago. It also sees Q2 operating margin of around 17%, compared to an earlier forecast of 21%-23%, after the early settlement of fuel hedges increased fuel costs.Despite the deteriorating performance, Delta estimated capacity expanded 3% in Q2, a at the high end of its 2%-3% view.Delta shares sank 3.1% in the stock market today. Rival United Airlines (UAL) fell 2.6%, and American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.4%. The declines also come after a wave of terror attacks in Turkey, Iraq, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia over the past week.Shares of Delta, United and American Air have been slumping for several months, all recently hitting their lowest levels since 2014.Investors have been hoping that the airlines could improve unit revenue -- a measure of an airline's efficiency -- after a two-year slump in oil prices prompted carriers to increase their flight coverage and cut airfares to compete. Airlines are now under pressure to keep capacity in line with passenger demand after concerns of overexpansion.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Ryanair (RYAAY), the Irish budget carrier and ardent 'Brexit' opponent, both reported June traffic increases of around 11% on Tuesday, a day after German carrier Lufthansa continued to back its full-year profit targets despite the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU and a string of terror attacks in the Middle East and Asia.Alaska Air Group said passenger traffic in June rose 10.9%, outpaced by a 11.7% increase in carrying capacity. Load factor, a measure of how effectively an airline fills seats, dipped 0.7 points to 86%.Shares edged down 0.2%.Ryanair, meanwhile, said June traffic rose 11% on a 1% rise in load factor to 94%. Those figures came ""despite the repeated disruptions caused by unacceptable French (air traffic controller) strikes"" that have forced the carrier to cancel flights. Ryanair urged the European Commission to intervene, as it has before.Ryanair shares sank 2.2%.Lufthansa, which has a joint venture with United, said on Monday that it still expected adjusted earnings before interest and taxes this year to come in at around $2 billion.""We had a buffer from the first few months of the year, so even if we have some weaker months our guidance remains the same,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said, according to Reuters.Lufthansa's announcement comes after IAG, the owner of British Airways, lowered its full-year profit forecast shortly after the outcome of the vote, which sent the pound crashing to a 30-year low. European budget carrier EasyJet last week also said it expected a weaker financial performance following the Brexit vote.Some analysts have worried about Brexit's potential impact on U.S. airlines. The weaker pound against the dollar could be great for American tourists going to the U.K., not so great for U.K. travelers coming to the States.Others have worried a Brexit could stiffen passport controls, hurt airline profits and jeopardize the ""open skies"" agreement between the U.S. and the EU. That agreement allows U.S. carriers to partner and share revenue with U.K. airlines without violating antitrust law.American Airlines has one such partnership with British Airways and has the most flight capacity dedicated to the U.K. Delta, meanwhile, owns nearly half of British carrier Virgin Atlantic.

1362,ALK,"Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) warning on its second-quarter unit revenue raised fears that fare discounts from rivals could be weighing, sinking shares Tuesday and putting pressure on Southwest (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK).Late Monday, Spirit said Q2 total unit revenue, which measures the money an airline makes as it relates to available seats and flight distance, ""came in at the low end of the range contemplated in our initial guidance for the quarter (down 14.3% year over year).""Spirit also said it saw ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period."" Industrywide fare discounting -- some of it prompted by aggressive expansion from low-cost carriers like Spirit into the bigger airlines' turf -- has hurt airlines' unit revenue.Shares closed down 6.1% on the stock market today. The stock is making its way through a cup base begun in April. Southwest shed 1.1%, JetBlue eased 1.2% and Alaska fell 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Airline stocks have struggled in recent months. But domestic-focused carriers such as Spirit Airlines, Alaska and Southwest have fared far better than global giants such as United, Delta and American, which are more exposed to the strong dollar and other global headwinds. How does Spirit's stock compare with its larger rivals? See IBD Stock Checkup for more information.Spirit also estimated that its economic fuel cost crept up 2 cents from its earlier forecast to $1.47 per gallon. But the increase wasn't as steep as those forecast this month by American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). Wall Street has been concerned that airlines have been too dependent on cheap oil for profits.However, Spirit said Q2 capacity growth likely came in at 23.1%, slightly lower than the 23.8% growth the company forecast in April. Investors have been hoping airlines would rein in their capacity, or supply of available seats, to improve unit revenue.Adjusted unit costs likely fell around 8%, Spirit said, better than the roughly 5% drop expected for the second quarter in April.Spirit's announcement came ahead of United Airlines' (UAL) second-quarter results, which topped Wall Street forecasts on earnings and revenue.United Airlines shares closed 0.3% higher then rallied 2% after the close. American lost less than 0.1%, Delta rose 1.1%, with both edging up late.

1364,ALK,"The State Department in meetings this summer will attempt to address Gulf airlines' competitive practices in the U.S. -- weighing the interests of major carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), smaller rivals like JetBlue (JBLU), and the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in a spat with no clear winners yet.At issue is the aggressive expansion in the U.S. of Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways and the UAE-based Emirates and Etihad Airways. The big three carriers in the U.S. -- American Airlines (AAL), Delta and United -- allege that their Gulf rivals have gotten a massive funding cushion from their governments, enabling them to easily, and unfairly, muscle in on new markets and drop prices. The Gulf airlines have adamantly denied those claims.The big three U.S. carriers want the State Department to change its ""open skies"" agreements and slap restrictions on flights from the Gulf carriers into the U.S.But smaller players, including JetBlue and Alaska Air Group (ALK) -- which have partnerships with the Gulf carriers -- worry any changes to current agreements could set a precedent for more barrier-raising among competing airlines.The State Department has invited a group that includes Alaska, JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings (HA) and others to meet on Wednesday to potentially discuss the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported.And next month, the State Department meets with the UAE and Qatar for ""informal, technical discussions."" But the U.S. is not planning at this point to attempt to formally rework the ""open skies"" pacts or stop new flights to the U.S. from the Gulf airlines, sources told the paper.The nature of the discussions, so far, is unclear. But people representing both the smaller and larger carriers appeared to try to claim the upper hand over the meetings, with some reservations.The trade group U.S. Travel Association, an opponent to the big three's requested restrictions, praised the State Department's decision to invite it and smaller airlines to the Wednesday meeting, according to the Journal. However, the group said it was uncertain whether the discussions with the Gulf nations next month would produce any results.Meanwhile, a source familiar with the big airlines' perspective told the Journal that the July meetings were ""a good development"" but also ""kind of open-ended.""Shares of Delta gained back 3.9% to 34.67 in the stock market today after four straight losing session. American, which also has partnerships with Qatar Airways and Etihad, surged 5.9% to 26.77, and United added 3.2% to 38.95.

1366,ALK,"Despite Brexit-inspired global growth woes that pushed bond yields to record lows, stocks rose, helped by a strong jobs report. Breakouts were more common. Tesla Motors (TSLA) held up amid negative headlines. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) bet big on oil, but crude prices promptly suffered heavy losses. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and other carriers face stiff headwinds.The major averages were up and down for most of the week, but moved higher after Friday's strong jobs report. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% for the week, settling Friday just 1 point below a record close and 5 points from an all-time best. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9%. General Electric (GE), Facebook (FB), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Pepsi (PEP) were among the notable breakouts. Apple (AAPL) retook its 50-day moving average. Health food stocks soared after Danone agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV).The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low but closed above those levels Friday.The U.S. economy added 287,000 jobs in June, far more the 180,000 economists expected. It was a sharp bounceback from May, which saw its meager gain of 38,000 revised down to just 11,000. The jobless rate rose to 4.9%, reflecting a jump in the labor force.Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 144,000. That, along with the upward trend in wage gains, might have been enough for the Federal Reserve to start hiking rates again soon, but Brexit will likely keep policymakers on the cautious side.Minutes from the Fed's June 14-15 meeting, when policymakers kept rates steady, revealed concern over the June 23 Brexit vote and the sharp slowdown in U.S. job gains in May. But there remained divisions over the labor market's general health, inflation trends and the outlook for economic growth.Tesla Motors said car deliveries fell well below its forecast for the second quarter. The 14,370 vehicles delivered fell short of its guidance of 17,000, due to ""the extreme production ramp in Q2 and the high mix of customer-ordered vehicles still on trucks and ships at the end of the quarter."" But production fell short of Tesla's estimates as well.It was the second quarter in a row that Tesla has missed its own delivery targets, and it comes as Tesla has made a much-criticized bid to acquire SolarCity (SCTY). A key objection to a SolarCity deal is that it could distract Tesla from ramping up vehicle production.Meanwhile, Tesla confirmed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a preliminary evaluation into the performance of the Autopilot feature in the Model S, following a recent fatal crash. The NHTSA confirmed it will also investigate the recent nonfatal crash of a Tesla Model X ""to determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.""Tesla shares rose 0.1% fractionally for the week, just between its 50-day and 200-day lines, which crossed in bearish fashion during the week.Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their partners said they would invest $36.8 billion to expand the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan. Main operator Chevron and its partners have already spent $37 billion on the project. The report comes after BP (BP) said it would spend $8 billion to build another liquefied natural gas plant in Indonesia. Energy giants had cut spending as crude prices fell but the new investments could be a sign that companies are confident about the price rebound after a rally in 2015 failed.But did oil majors bet at just the wrong time? Crude prices have tumbled this week amid global growth concerns, a stronger dollar and higher-than-expected U.S. inventories. U.S. crude fell 7.1% to $45.41 a barrel, its biggest weekly drop since February. Brent futures sank 7.1% to $46.76 a barrel, its sharpest loss since January.Samsung Electronics posted its biggest Q2 sales gain in more than two years, helped by strong demand for its Galaxy S7 handsets. Samsung is benefiting from weaker-than-expected demand for Apple's iPhone 6S handsets. Apple's next smartphone, the iPhone 7, likely will be released in September, but it isn't expected to be much different than the 6S. Apple moved sideways during the week, but the stock closed above its falling 50-day line on Thursday.Meanwhile, BlackBerry (BBRY) said it's ending production of its iconic BlackBerry Classic mobile phones.Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) were among the health-focused food companies that got a lift after French dairy products maker Danone (DANOY) agreed Thursday to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) -- the owner of Silk soy milk and brands that include Horizon Organic -- in a $10 billion deal. The proposed merger highlights the trend among consumers toward healthier fare. On Thursday, WhiteWave rose 19%, Hain Celestial climbed 7% and Amplify rose 2%. For the week they rose 20%, 6% and 9%, respectively.Delta Air Lines forecast Q2 operating margin and a unit revenue decline that were worse than it had anticipated in April. The carrier also said fuel costs were far higher than expected. Unit revenue declines for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) might not level off until the end of 2017, Credit Suisse said, while earnings could also come in below consensus for that year. Among the reasons cited for the darker forecast are higher fuel costs, labor deals, Brexit and an unfavorable foreign exchange environment.Southwest Airlines (LUV) traffic rose 6.8% in June, more than the 5.4% capacity increase.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said June traffic rose 10.9%, outpaced by an 11.7% capacity increase. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said June traffic rose 11%, while load factor edged up to 94%.Delta, American, United, Southwest and Alaska Air rose modestly for the week, while Ryanair fell somewhat, but well off its lows.Comcast (CMCSA) soon will offer direct access to Netflix (NFLX) for subscribers with its broadband-based X1 set-top box. The nation's No. 1 pay-TV operator previously refused to allow third-party, over-the-top internet video services on its set-top boxes, for competitive reasons. The arrangement is seen as a win-win for both firms. The deal bolsters Comcast's broadband service and reduces the risk of cord-cutting, while providing an easy on-ramp to Netflix service for new and existing customers.Costco said June sales increased 3% to $11.33 billion, while sales for the 44 weeks ended July 3 rose 2% to $96.33 billion. Shares climbed 5% Thursday in heavy volume, breaking past a 158.89 buy point from a double-bottom base with a handle.Pepsi also broke out Thursday, rising 1.5% to clear a 107.04 flat-base buy point in heavy trade. The packaged-food and beverage giant said quarterly earnings increased 2% to $1.35 a share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Sales fell 3.3% to $15.4 billion, but were above forecasts.Costco rose 1.1% to 165.44 on Friday while Pepsi climbed 0.7% to 108.27.The drugstore chain topped Q3 profit views by 4 cents with 16% growth to $1.18 per share, but revenue gains of 2% to $29.5 billion missed analyst estimates for $29.7 billion. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 3.7%. International retail pharmacy sales fell 2.3% but rose 3.4% ex currency. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) raised the lower end of full-year guidance by a dime to $4.45-$4.55, vs. views for $4.49. But shares lost 1.5% for the week, below their 200-day line but rebounding from their 50-day line.

1367,ALK,"Stocks look set to finish the week lower, with the key market indexes holding moderate losses just before Friday's closing bell.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, continued to weigh on the Nasdaq, sinking more than 2%, following bombshell news that a Chinese court ruled that Apple cannot sell its iPhone due to similarities in design with domestic manufacturer Shenzhen Baili's rival product. The Cupertino, Calif., tech giant is reportedly appealing the ruling.The Nasdaq composite is down 0.9%, trading near session lows; the Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on that exchange, sank 0.9%. But the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average are each off 0.3%, while the S&P SmallCap 600 was fighting to break even.Some airline stocks are rebounding, helping the Dow transports lift 0.6% higher. However, among the 197 industry groups and subgroups that IBD tracks every day, the airlines are poised to be the worst performer this week, down more than 3%.United Airlines (UAL) jumped 2% in below-average trade. But the stock has been acting poorly ever since it crashed through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in severe volume on April 21. A day earlier, United Airlines reported a 19% fall in Q1 earnings to $1.23 a share, which still beat the consensus forecast. But revenue dipped 5%, the worst performance on the top side in at least four years. Plus, it and other airlines face the prospect of higher fuel costs, which are its single biggest expense.Crude oil futures are down for the week, yet they have still rallied sharply from their mid-February lows.United Airlines sports a miserable 28 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup; the highest Composite score (93) in the airlines group belongs to Virgin America (VA), which is being acquired by Alaska Air (ALK). Alaska Air fell 0.8% in late-afternoon action.Other industry groups likely to finish weakest include mortgage financing services, biotech, super regional banks and hospitals.As noted in stock market updates on Wednesday and Thursday, Apple is suffering from a crisis in institutional demand. The stock became a top fund darling ever since it first broke out of a terrific cup-with-handle base near 28 (now at following a couple stock splits) in March 2004. However, both the number of mutual and hedge funds continues to drop amid concerns of a continued fall in revenues.On the upside, Lumentum (LITE) swung 1.6% lower after gaining sharply in the morning, up as much as 7.6%. The optical networking gear specialist was formerly part of the now-dismantled telecom equipment giant JDS Uniphase. Lumentum is part of IBD's fiber optics industry group, which is having an outstanding week, up nearly 3%, on the back of an IPO base breakout by new issue and optical interconnect technology leader Acacia Communications (ACIA). (Read more about Acacia in IBD's Industry Themes column.)Acacia was trading down 1.5% to 43.65, in buy range above a 43.20 IPO base entry.As seen in Thursday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook was downgraded from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure."" This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower given the increased intensity of professional selling. The Nasdaq composite saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to 4.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

1368,ALK,"Wall Street continued to unload shares of American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) in the stock market today, following the U.K.'s vote last week to leave the European Union.American Airlines, which has the most flight exposure to the U.K., sank 6.6% to 25.27, the lowest since December 2013. United plunged 8.1%, while Delta tumbled 5.2%, both the lowest since 2014. American Air lost 11% Friday, with United off 9% and Delta 8%.Nobody knows what the business landscape would look like for the U.K. following a departure from the bloc, but the long process of hammering out a formal separation agreement could further heighten economic uncertainty.Analysts have also worried that a so-called ""Brexit"" would dampen travel demand and jeopardize U.S. airlines' ability to collaborate with carriers that are based in the U.K. American has such a partnership with British Airways.Delta, meanwhile, owns roughly half of British carrier Virgin Atlantic.In Europe, conditions continued to be far worse. Budget carrier EasyJet on Monday forecast weaker revenue per seat for the second half of the year as a result of the U.K.'s vote, saying it expected ""additional economic and consumer uncertainty"" this summer. The carrier said it expected a constant-currency decline in revenue per seat of ""at least a mid-single digit percentage"" as a result of the referendum outcome.On Friday, EasyJet said it was ""confident"" the vote would ""not have a material impact on its strategy or its ability to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth and returns to shareholders.""The carrier said then that it had been preparing for a potential vote in favor of leaving the EU and that it would ""accelerate discussions"" with authorities to ""ensure that the U.K. remains part of the single EU aviation market."" Its shares traded on the London exchange went into freefall, losing 23.7%Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), a vocal supporter of the U.K. staying in the EU, followed EasyJet down, with its U.S.-listed shares plummeting 13.9%. Ryanair lost 4.35% on Friday.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV) and other, more-U.S. focused carriers sold off more modestly.Southwest dropped 4%, while JetBlue (JBLU) sank 2% Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) fell 1.5%, as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) were whacked by 2.3%.

1369,ALK,"American Airlines (AAL) said Thursday that it continued to expect second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 6% to 8% after releasing May traffic results.The company also said it still expected a Q2 adjusted pretax margin of between 14% to 16%.The carrier said May traffic rose 0.5%, while carrying capacity rose 1.7%. Load factor, or how effectively airlines put people in seats, fell 0.9 percentage point to 81.9%.Shares closed up 2.7% on the stock market today.Investors have been hoping airlines will keep capacity growth more in line with passenger demand after two years during which low oil prices have prompted the industry to expand flight coverage and cut fares to compete.Higher capacity, lower airfares, weaker passenger demand and a stronger dollar have hurt airlines' unit revenue, which measures how much money airlines make relative to available seats on planes. Airlines have vowed to turn the key metric around.Delta Air Lines (DAL), which hopes to be the first to get unit revenue back on track this year, said Wednesday that it would ""hopefully"" produce Q2 unit revenue within the low range of its guidance of a 2.5%-4.5% decline. The carrier also said Q2 operating margin would be near the low end of its forecast of 21%-23%.Still, Delta said unit costs would likely come in better than expected. Falling unit revenue is easier on a carrier when unit costs also drop.Also Thursday, Virgin AmericaVA, which is being acquired by Alaska Air GroupALK, said May traffic rose 18.1%, with capacity up 15.5% and load factor up 1.9 percentage points to 86.1%.Airline stocks got a boost this week after an analyst report found that airfare hikes have held.Delta Air Lines gained 1.3%. Alaska Air added 1.7%, and United Airlines (UAL) rose 2.2%.

1374,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) warned on two key operating metrics Wednesday, while Southwest (LUV) said it continues to expect a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, based on May traffic results.After the close, United Airlines (UAL) said traffic fell 1.2%, while capacity edged up 0.5% and load factor dipped 1.4 percentage points. Discount carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said traffic jumped 24.8% as capacity surged 24%. Load factor edged up 0.6 point.Delta CFO Paul Jacobson, speaking at a conference, guided Q2 passenger unit revenue to the low end of its expected range, saying it will be closer to a 4.5% decline vs. prior views for a 2.5%-4.5% drop. He also said Q2 operating margin will be near the low end of its 21%-23% outlook.The warning comes just a few weeks after Delta said it will become “the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year.”Shares of Delta closed down 0.6% in the stock market today. United dipped 0.3%, and American Airlines (AAL) edged up 0.5%. Southwest rallied 1%.Southwest said traffic rose 6.4% last month, compared to an increase in carrying capacity of 4.6%. Load factor, a way to measure how effectively an airline puts passengers in seats, rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.8%.On Tuesday, the carrier offered a three-day low-fare sale for some domestic and international fall travel.But it and other airlines -- including JetBlue (JBLU), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Virgin America (VA) -- got a bump in stock price Tuesday on an analyst report indicating the industry had slightly raised fares. Alaska Air signed a deal earlier this year to buy Virgin America, pending regulatory approval.Wall Street has been concerned about the lower airfares that have characterized much of the industry since 2014. Over the past two years, cheap oil has kept fuel costs thin and margins fat, prompting flight expansions and discounting, with investors worrying airlines could overestimate demand.In Europe, meanwhile, Air France-KLM said Wednesday that May traffic rose 0.8%, while capacity increased 1.8%. Load factor fell 0.8 points to 84.1%.Air France pilots plan to strike beginning on Saturday, a day after the Euro 2016 soccer championship is set to start in France, drawing huge crowds, the Financial Times noted this weekend.Air France executives called the strikes ""deplorable"" and said they would hinder the airline's recent turnaround, the Times said. The pilots want better pay and more resources devoted to operations in France, as opposed to KLM, a Dutch airline and Air France subsidiary, according to reports in the Times and the Independent.The demonstrations would be in keeping with a wave of strikes -- including by air traffic controllers -- that threaten to overtake the nation. Many workers in France are protesting measures that would allow employers to hire and fire workers more easily.Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) has called the air traffic controller strikes ""unjustified"" and said they caused dozens of flight cancellations.Ryanair shares fell 1.3%.

1375,ALK,"Shares of Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) tumbled after Qatar Airways said it scrapped its first order for one of Airbus' A320neo planes and could cancel more following months of software and engine-related problems with the jet.That's bad news for United Technologies (UTX), who owns Pratt & Whitney, which produces many of the engines for the single-aisle, fuel-efficient planes. But it could represent an opportunity for Boeing and General Electric (GE) and French engine-maker Safran, who run a joint venture that also produces an engine for jet.Qatar Airways said it would think about purchasing A320neos with the engine from the joint venture and could also go with Boeing's 737 Max, according to the Wall Street Journal.U.S.-listed shares of Airbus closed down 1.8% in the stock market today. Boeing rose 0.4%. United Technologies dipped 0.4%, and GE also lost 0.4%.Qatar Airways' decision to abandon the order follows months during which the carrier publicly aired its dissatisfaction with the A320neo delays.“It is making a huge impact on my bottom line,” Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said, according to the Journal. “We are quite frankly screaming.”In April, Al Baker was more subdued, but not by much.""We have talked to Airbus, they know very well that we're a very unhappy, very unhappy customer,"" he said, according to Reuters.Near the end of last year, Qatar Airways, who was set to be the first to receive the planes, decided not to take the first A320neo order until Pratt & Whitney removed some operational restrictions on the engines. German carrier Lufthansa, who was next in line to receive the first jet, also didn't get it when promised. Other problems with the engines have followed.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are among the possible suitors who could fund and then eventually buy Panama-based carrier Avianca, the Journal also reported.If a merger agreement takes hold, it would continue the worldwide trend in recent years of airline consolidation. Such consolidation has helped filter out competition and temper capacity growth in an industry that has been plagued by bankruptcies over the decades and often accused by Wall Street of undisciplined expansion.Alaska Air Group (ALK) in April said it would buy Virgin America (VA). That combination could help box rival JetBlue (JBLU) out of the West Coast but present challenges given Virgin's struggles to compete on profitability and lower fares.Delta shares were down 1.9%, with United also down 1.9%.

1378,ALK,"It turns out that Dubai-based Emirates -- the world's biggest international airline best known for its ultracosmopolitan plane interiors and aggressive overseas expansion -- has to deal with the same problems that less flashy rivals like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) face.The carrier -- whose growth plans have been a headache for the U.S. carriers -- said Tuesday that a measure of how full its seats were fell to 76.5% during its most recent fiscal year from 79.6%. The slide came amid a 13% jump in seating capacity and ""lingering economic uncertainty and strong competition in many markets.""What's more, Emirates' overall revenue fell 4% to $23.2 billion, with a tough currency exchange environment costing the company $1.6 billion. Passenger revenue fell by 3%. The stronger dollar also prompted a 10% decline in the carrier's passenger yield -- a measure of how much an airline gets from airfare as it relates to distance flown.Shares of Delta closed up 1.3% on the stock market today, United climbed 2.8%, and American added 2.5%. Southwest (LUV) rallied 1.6% and Alaska Air Group (ALK) rose 0.8%. JetBlue (JBLU), which has a codeshare agreement with Emirates, fell 0.6%.American also stuck to its forecast Tuesday for a 6%-8% drop in second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue and said that April traffic fell 0.2% year over year, with capacity up 1.3%.""Looking at the year ahead, we expect that the low oil prices will continue to be a double-edged sword – a boon for our operating costs, but a bane for global business and consumer confidence,"" Emirates CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement. ""The strong U.S. dollar against major currencies will remain a challenge, as will the looming threat of protectionism in some countries.""The results follow a year in which Emirates expanded its fleet to 251 aircraft and broadened its passenger flight coverage to eight new areas, including Orlando, Fla. Those moves have posed stiffer competition stateside and abroad for Delta, American and United.The carrier now operates in many major U.S. cities, and has drawn attention over the years for its in-cabin bars, spas and state-of-the-art entertainment options on some flights. But terror attacks in Europe, where Emirates gets nearly a third of its revenue, and elsewhere dampened travelers' spirits.The results also come as U.S. airlines continue to try investors' patience over ever-growing capacity and falling unit revenue, a much-watched metric that is often a reflection of an airline's efficiency and ability to draw as much money as possible from passengers.Many analysts feel airlines have lacked sufficient restraint in their expansion plans, and worry they'll end up with too many seats compared to passengers who want to fly. Some airlines during last month's earnings season said they would pull back capacity growth to improve unit revenue, which has fallen due to inadequate demand and a stronger dollar.

1382,ALK,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

1383,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), and United Airlines (UAL) sold off after Air France-KLM became the latest air carrier to express caution over potential lower airfares and unit revenue.The French-Dutch carrier warned Wednesday of a ""a high level of uncertainty"" amid broader industry concerns about oil prices and a tough foreign exchange environment.On Tuesday, German carrier Lufthansa said it could face lower airfares and that it would rein in its expansion.Delta slid 3.5% in the stock market today. American dropped 4%, and United fell 3.35%. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), however, crept up less than 0.1%.The declines come after a round of similar warnings during the airline industry's earnings season, much of which took place last month.Delta, for instance, expressed uncertainty over how long cheap oil -- and thus the industry's recent wave of quarterly profits -- could last. The company said it would cut carrying capacity if needed to improve unit revenue, a measure of how much an airline makes relative to how much capacity it has.The key metric is often a window into ticket prices and has generally fallen as airlines expanded over the last year or so. Investors and analysts have been watching for signals as to when airlines might be able to turn unit revenue around.Elsewhere, American also said last month that it expected lower unit revenue following “competitive capacity growth,” while United also said it would temper its growth plans.Other discount and regional carriers sold off as well. Southwest (LUV) dropped 3.4%, while low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) fell 4.2%. JetBlue (JBLU) eased 3%. Alaska Air Group (ALK), which recently announced the purchase of Virgin America (VA), was down 1.9%.

1395,ALK,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) is expected to announce a deal to buy Virgin America (VA) for more than $2 billion on Monday, besting JetBlue (JBLU) in the bidding process, according to several reports.Alaska Air will pay $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal's prospects on Saturday. Reuters reported Alaska would pay $56-$58 a share for Virgin America, which closed at 38.90 on Friday. It was 30.67 on March 22, before reports that Richard Branson's carrier was putting itself up to sale.Virgin America, which began in 2007, sought to offer substantial amenities and low fares. Few peers sought to provide that combination at the time, and even fewer do now.The deal would move Alaska over JetBlue as the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.It would be the first notable airline merger since American Airlines (AAL) and US Airways combined in 2013. An Alaska-Virgin deal likely would receive close regulatory scrutiny given that the top four carriers -- American Airlines, United Continental (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) -- dominate 80% of U.S. traffic.Delta Air Lines likely will release March traffic figures early this week.

1396,ALK,"The ""I"" in CAN SLIM represents one of the key driving factors behind the stock market's advances and declines: the big money.The big money is also known as institutional investors, so the ""I"" stands for institutional sponsorship. That refers to ownership of shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and other big investors. Since their buying and selling account for the majority of trading on the stock exchanges, it's a good idea to have them on your side.""Buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""These heavyweights tend to buy thousands of shares at a time. After all, they deploy millions to billions of dollars in the market on behalf of their clients. The pros will usually buy shares in an installment-like frequency, instead of all at once, to avoid running prices up too much. So it can take weeks, or even months, for them to build a full position.Mutual funds report their portfolio holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter. Investors can access the data on the SEC's Edgar website.When researching individual stocks, always check to see if they are owned by institutions. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a finger on the pulse of institutional activity. The rating range from A to E, with an A pointing to recent net buying by mutual funds and an E indicating recent net selling. A C is neutral, so an A or B is preferable.The proprietary rating is available in the daily stock tables and minicharts in the print issue, as well as the Stock Checkup tool on Investors.com. Another useful gauge is the number of funds buying shares -- you'd ideally see an increase from quarter to quarter. Both metrics show up in the Technical Performance section of Stock Checkup, under the ""Supply And Demand"" header.Another place to spot what some highly regarded mutual funds are buying (and selling) is in IBD's Funds & Personal Finance section. The first page (today on Page A11) usually includes two big funds' largest U.S. holdings, top new buys and top sells. Scan the lists to see if a stock you're considering buying shows up here.""A winning stock doesn't need a huge number of institutional owners, but it should have several at a minimum,"" O'Neil wrote.The monthly mutual fund special also offers insight into which stocks the top funds are buying. In IBD's May 7, 2014, edition (1), the special section noted Alaska Air Group (ALK) as one of the stocks being bought heavily by top fund managers. Shares of the airline have since staged breakouts from a series of bases and gained as much as 84% from the week ended May 9, 2014 to a December 2015 high of 87.17.

1399,ALK,"Shares of Virgin America (VA) spiked 10.4% Monday after Bloomberg reported that JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) have offered to buy the air carrier.A deal could be announced as soon as next week. But analysts differ broadly on which airline would benefit more.Virgin America stock finished at 37.71 on the stock market today, its highest close since early December and near a breakout from a cup base. JetBlue rose 2.7%, and Alaska Air gained 1.1%.The news comes after Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that Virgin America was considering putting up all or part of itself for sale after receiving ""takeover interest."" Whether others would attempt to buy Virgin America was not known, Bloomberg said Monday, but speculation has swirled over who was among the possible bidders and whether the airline industry was ripe for more consolidation.Many analysts have seen JetBlue as a likely bidder for Virgin, given the carriers' similarities in fleets -- Airbus (EADSY) A320s and A321s -- and other services.""JetBlue would gain access to Hawaii, as Virgin America started flying there in the 2015 fourth quarter,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note last week. ""Alaska Air Group could also play a role in industry consolidation; however, given Alaska relies on the (Boeing (BA)) 737 and loves the aircraft, we believe it is a bit unlikely they would be a bidder for the company.""However, competition in Dallas from Southwest (LUV) has proven to be stressful for Virgin and American Airlines (AAL), which means that it could be stressful for JetBlue.Airline Weekly said in its March 28 issue that JetBlue is ""the most obvious fit on paper, given what a Virgin merger would do to improve its lot on (transcontinental) markets, where the New York-based airline can still use some help. Then again, does it really want a big increase in transcon exposure while inheriting Virgin’s short-haul problems in Dallas and elsewhere?""An acquisition of Virgin by Delta Air Lines (DAL), which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, could boost its operations out of Los Angeles, Becker said. But she and others think the regulatory climate is a bit too frigid for Delta, United Airlines (UAL) or American Airlines to pull off an acquisition. Regulators' resistance could make a private-equity acquisition more likely. VX Holdings and Cyrus Capital Partners hold more than half of Virgin's shares.""United would surely love to eliminate its San Francisco competitor, but antitrust regulators are in no mood to let the Big Three get any bigger,"" Airline Weekly said. ""Southwest or Alaska wouldn’t mind getting bigger in California, but their B737 fleets don’t mesh well with Virgin’s A320s.""Hawaiian Holdings (HA), Becker also noted, ""could be an interesting player, as the company will be taking delivery of A321s beginning in 2017 and will use those aircraft to fly to more cities in the mid-continent area.""Wolfe Research, meanwhile, speculated last week that Etihad, a carrier based in the United Arab Emirates, might be interested in snapping up assets of Virgin America.""Etihad has equity ownership in seven global airlines -- none in the U.S.,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote last week. ""Cyrus Capital Partners owns 24% of VA. Cyrus tried to sell its stake last year but pulled its offering because of a low stock price. A sale of that entire stake to Etihad would be feasible, we believe, given it would comply with foreign ownership caps of 25% of voting stock. Note Etihad also has a 24% ownership stake in Virgin Australia.""Either way, any sale of Virgin America would follow the carrier's plans to boost future carrying capacity, a factor in the industry's merger wave several years ago. It would also come as signs of weakness in Europe's airlines invite more consolidation. And Wolfe Research this month forecast that Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier would eventually merge ""to avoid eating into each other’s growth prospects""""We do not believe U.S. airline industry consolidation is over,"" Becker said in a note on Monday. ""We expect there are likely to be more consolidating events especially at the (ultralow-cost carrier) and regional level. We also expect US airlines to continue to invest in foreign airlines (think Delta's investments in Virgin Atlantic and Aeromexico) as well as entity sales (think slot swaps / transactions).""

1410,ALK,"Airline stocks on Thursday continued to falter for a third day after the terrorist attacks in Brussels. Oil prices were edging lower once again, which usually gives a boost to airlines, but the oil benefit wasn't strong enough to outweigh the current global travel fears.Let’s take a look at the charts of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Air Group (ALK).Delta’s 2.2% drop put the stock further away from a cup-with-handle buy point it cleared in strong volume on Friday. Thursday’s volume was lighter than average. Shares are now trading 9% below their December peak.American fell 3.4% in above-average turnover. The stock breached support at the 200-day line and is now looking for support at the 50-day line. Shares are trading 24% below their 52-week high.United gapped down 3.2% in above-average volume. Shares are above their 200-day line, but the stock has moved more or less sideways for many months. It’s 15% below its 52-week peak.Southwest was also down for a third straight day, falling 0.8%, but it was able to pare its losses. Volume was light. The stock was trading 14% below its high and a potential buy point.And Alaska dropped 0.65% in lighter-than-average trade. Shares are still trading in buy range from a cup-with-handle base the stock broke out of earlier this month. Alaska is 7% below its December high.
"
1411,ALK,"Most airline stocks were down on Wednesday, yet not by much, following Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels. Airline stocks in general are making their way through -- or trying to emerge from -- consolidations.United Airlines (UAL) fell 1.2% to 59.74 in the stock market today, after finding resistance above 61 once again on Monday. The buy point is 61.97. Shares over the past month have moved above their 50-day and 200-day lines, both key tests of investor support. The all-time high was 74.52 on Jan. 26, 2015.Delta Air Lines (DAL) dropped below a 49.55 buy point on Tuesday following the Brussels attacks and continued to slip Wednesday. Shares lost 1% to 48.91, so the stock could still retake the buy point. On Friday and Monday, the shares started to break out from a cup-with-handle base begun in December.A week before Delta's attempt at a breakout, Alaska Air Group (ALK) delivered an uppercut through a 78.55 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and rose most of the way until dipping Tuesday and losing 1.1% to 81.12 on Wednesday. The stock is in buy range until 82.48. As with Delta, Alaska Air Group first began carving out the base in December. The stock still maintains a solid cushion from its 50-day and 200-day lines.Virgin America (VA) shares bolted 13.2% to 34.72 on reports that it might put all or part of itself up for sale, Bloomberg reported. Shares have consolidated since December, when they hit a 52-week high of 39.20.Southwest (LUV) is currently making its way through a cup base. Shares fell 0.3% to 44.43. That's still distant from a 51.44 buy point, though the stock could form a handle and thus create a lower buy area.Hawaiian Airlines (HA) cleared a consolidation last month and has been trading tightly since March 8. Shares rose 0.8%.Low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), which is based in Ireland and has flight routes throughout Europe, continues to work on a cup-with-handle base with an entry point of 84.71. Shares rose 1% to 83.75.While Tuesday's attacks and concerns about the impact on air travel going forward are negative factors for airline stocks, oil prices fell Wednesday amid higher inventories. That bodes well for carriers' jet fuel costs. S&P Capital IQ analysts see oil staying depressed in a new research note.""We think that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than many investors and experts are currently thinking. ... This is a great cost environment for the U.S. airline industry.""

Shares are now extended 28% above an 83.53 cup-base buy point.Mortgage lending services provider LendingTree (TREE) climbed nearly 5%. The rise brought the stock back above a 97.85 buy point in a first stage cup-with-handle base.Michael Kors (KORS) gave back early gains but still rose 0.5%. It's closing in on a breakout over a recent high of 59.49. Shares were recently trading around 57.28 after hitting an intraday high of 58.63.Elsewhere, Tesla Motors (TSLA) jumped 6% after CEO Elon Musk said pre-orders for its Model 3 electric car reached 276,000 by Saturday night.

1414,ALK,"The stock market turned lower Monday after decent gains early in the session.The Nasdaq fell 0.5%, the S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.2%. Volume was tracking close to Friday's levels in the stock market today.In economic news, orders placed with U.S. factories slipped 1.7% in February, the Commerce Department reported, reversing a (downwardly revised) 1.2% increase in January. The February result was largely in line with economists' consensus, which had forecast a 1.6% slip.Dow stocks were evenly split up and down, but losses were deeper than gains. General Electric (GE), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC) all dropped more than 1%. Home Depot (HD) led the upside with an 0.7% gain.Virgin America (VA) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) grabbed headlines, spiking 40% and 30%, respectively, at the start of trade. Virgin announced a $2.6 billion takeover by Alaska Airlines (ALK). Ruckus said that it would be folded into Brocade Communications (BRCD) for about $1.2 billion.Stocks related to natural gas packed into the top of the S&P 500, as natural gas prices popped 3%.But Edwards Lifesciences (EW) led both the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 list, spiking 16% out of the starting gate.  The Irvine, Cal.-based medical devices maker announced positive trials for its SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN XRT aortic valve replacements. Shares are now extended almost 24% above an 83.53 cup-base buy point.Mortgage lending services provider LendingTree (TREE) climbed 5% in moderate trade. The rise brought the stock back above a 97.85 buy point in a first stage cup-with-handle base. The stock remains in buy range through 102.74Smith & Wesson (SWHC) dived 14%, apparently tripped up by analyst downgrades. BB&T Capital Markets trimmed its rating to hold from buy. Cowen & Co. downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform. The stock had been fighting to hold a 26.64 buy point in a cup base. Monday's heavy-volume move sent shares 11% below that mark and below support at its 10-week moving average.Another possible factor was firearms background checks for March, which are a rough gauge for industrywide sales. March numbers were the lowest in four months.Peer Sturm Ruger (RGR) felt some of the suction, diving 7% in powerful trade and also cutting its 10-week moving average.
"
1415,ALK,"Alaska Air Group's (ALK) takeover of Virgin America (VA) allows it to expand on the West Coast, where it competes aggressively with Delta Air Lines (DAL) in Seattle, but it also inherits Virgin's struggles to stay abreast of an industry unafraid to cut fares or borrow from its in-flight panache.Alaska Air on Monday said it would buy Virgin for $57 a share, or $2.6 billion, beating out rival bidder JetBlue (JBLU). The deal is expected to close by Jan. 1, 2017.Virgin America shares soared 41.7% to 55.12. Alaska fell 3.8%, and JetBlue dropped 4.3%.Analysts said the lesson for Virgin, which launched nearly a decade ago with plans to restore glamour to a utilitarian, consolidation-prone industry, is that in-flight atmosphere isn't everything.""This was an airline that never really found its footing in terms of profitability,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""It's been sustainable over the past few years just because the tide is so high in the U.S. that you can be the least profitable airline and still be profitable in global terms.""The deal comes after Virgin's profitability has soared on low fuel costs. But earnings still lagged other carriers' as Virgin struggled to compete against lower-cost airlines. For example, it had said it would not lower fares in the highly competitive Dallas region.But despite the popularity of Virgin's mood-lighting and in-flight entertainment, the lounge-like setting was perhaps a bit too lavish for customers who just wanted more affordable airfares.""That made it impossible for them to ever be all that profitable in short-haul markets,"" Kaplan said.It's unclear what will become of Virgin America. Alaska Air said on a conference call that the Alaska brand would stay and that they wanted to ""learn more"" about the Virgin America brand for potential future use.Kaplan said that Alaska's stronger balance sheet gives it flexibility to step up its business-class offerings or stick with what it has. Alaska is unlikely to bring premium products to shorter flights, he said, but it's also unlikely to gut what's made Virgin a well-liked airline.For Alaska, which has been growing capacity aggressively in recent years, the deal expands its West Coast transcontinental flights. Kaplan also called it a defensive move to keep JetBlue at bay in the region.The deal boosts Alaska's scale, negotiating power and efficiency, and aligns with its broader plans to expand coverage, Loizos Heracleous, a professor at Warwick Business School and airline researcher, told IBD.Regulatory concerns are likely to be minimal, given the carriers' similarities and relatively small sizes, he added.But the deal raises questions about whether Alaska overpaid. Alaska's agreement to buy Virgin at $57 a share is 46% higher than Virgin's closing price Friday and 86% higher than the price on March 22, a day before Bloomberg reported Virgin was considering putting itself up for sale.Kaplan said that the price tag is ""very high for an airline that's not all that successful compared to most of its peers."" Heracleous said the bidding war raised the price to levels that will make it hard for Alaska to garner benefits that can justify the price, at least in the short-term.The move would also present challenges in Dallas, where Southwest (LUV) reigns supreme, American Airlines (AAL) has struggled to compete, and Virgin has gotten killed.""Alaska's going to have to make some decisions about whether to double down or do something different there, or tolerate it or get out and find somebody else to take the gates,"" Kaplan said.Still, analysts say it was the right time to cash in. While most profitable airlines had either a strong network or low costs, Virgin had neither of those.""If you don't have very low costs, you're just not going to generate the revenue premiums from the corporate travel community that you need when your network is inferior, when you don't have as many flights,"" Kaplan said. ""I don't care how much mood-lighting you have.""Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
1416,ALK,"Domestic-focused airlines like Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) may largely evade an expected downturn in corporate travel that looks set to hit larger rivals like American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL).In a Friday research note, Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg downgraded American, Delta, United and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) to hold from buy due to a slowdown in corporate profits that is typically a leading indicator of economic activity, as well as corporate travel.""The prevailing view is that we are in the latter stages of an economic cycle (April marks the 83rd month of U.S. GDP expansion, fourth longest on record) which is typically a period of underperformance for U.S. airline stocks,"" Linenberg said.Also, UBS analyst Darrly Genovesi said his Q1 EPS estimates are below analyst consensus, and cited data that books imply a 7% Q1 decline in carriers' unit revenue.United shares closed down 5.25% in the stock market today, despite falling oil prices. American lost 3.6%, Delta fell 3.4% and Hawaiian slipped 2.5%. Southwest dipped 0.5%, but JetBlue rallied 1%.On a brighter note, ""Consumer spending and housing, on the other hand, have fared better,"" Linenberg wrote, ""which should bolster demand for discretionary and leisure travel, at least through the summer.""Accordingly, Deutsche Bank analysts have favored ""domestic names that are less reliant on corporate travel"" -- specifically, Southwest, Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and SkyWest (SKYW).Shares of Spirit fell 2%, Alaska Air Group ended flat, and SkyWest slumped 1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1417,ALK,"Ahead of the anticipated release of March traffic data, several airline stocks -- including United Continental (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Virgin America (VA)  and Ryanair (RYAAY) -- are all at or near buy points.Delta, often the first to release monthly traffic and capacity data, fell 1.3% to 48.68 in the stock market today. The stock tried but failed to stage a breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 49.55 buy point earlier in the month, but it is presenting a new entry point at 50.60.The company said last week that Delta customers were among those killed in the March 22 terror attack at Brussels' Zaventem Airport. The airport said Thursday that it is ""technically ready"" to open again, according to an AFP report.European budget carrier Ryanair remains squarely in buy territory Thursday after breaking out last week from a cup-with-handle base with a 84.97 entry point, falling fractionally to 86.04 intraday. It uses Charleroi Airport, located an hour south of Brussels, which has become a key stop for air travelers while Zaventem remains closed, said Bloomberg. More than 90 of Ryanair's Thursday flights were canceled, however, due to strikes by French air traffic controllers.United shares rose less than 0.1% to 59.86, having formed a long, choppy base over the last year or so, with no clear entry point. But 61-62 has been a resistance area for the last several months.Meanwhile, Southwest shares were just shy of a 45.49 buy point mid-afternoon, down 0.4% to close at 44.80 after forming a cup-with-handle base since December. The carrier said Thursday that it is partnering with Lyft to reward Southwest loyalty program members who use the ride-sharing service for the first time.Virgin America rose as much as 39.18 intraday, edging it closer to an entry point of 39.30 from a cup base, though shares cooled to 38.56 at the close, up 0.2%. The stock has surged in recent days on reports that Virgin America has put itself for sale, and that JetBlue (JBLU) or Alaska Air Group (ALK) are suitors. Alaska Air broke out on March 11 and dipped 0.4% Thursday to 82.02, just below the top of the buy range at 82.52.

1418,ALK,"The stock market ended the week on a decidedly positive note as stocks opened nicely higher and strengthened into the close.The Nasdaq and S&P marked their fourth-straight weekly price gain. The Nasdaq gained 1.9%, the S&P 500 rallied 1.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 1.3%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up more than 2%.Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volumes coming in lower than Thursday's levels in the stock market today.Stocks followed the lead of European markets which rose sharply overnight. Germany's DAX soared 3.5%, the Paris CAC-40 gained 3.3% and London's FTSE added 1.7%Despite the stock market's strong gains, Friday's session was curiously light on breakouts.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) barely cleared a 580.10 buy point in light volume. Shares rose 1.2%.Alaska Air (ALK) cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 78.59. Shares jumped nearly 6% in solid trade. The handle area can be seen on the daily chart but not the weekly chart. Ideally, it's good to see a clear handle on both a daily and weekly chart.In earnings news, Nasdaq 100 component Ulta Beauty (ULTA) soared 17% after reporting strong earnings and giving bullish guidance late Thursday.China-based stocks also did well in the Nasdaq 100. JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and Ctrip.com (CTRP) all rose 3% or more.Elsewhere, fast-growing China Lodging Group (HTHT) jumped nearly 10% as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base. It's approaching a buy point of 33.10.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April crude oil settled at $38.50 a barrel, up 66 cents, or 1.7%.

1421,ALK,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares fell as the major carrier said consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 5.5% in February. Meanwhile, Alaska Air (ALK) initially dipped after reporting that capacity growth is still outstripping traffic growth.But Delta and Alaska stock charts are still acting well.Delta shares fell 0.7% on the stock market today to 48.55, closing near session highs. The stock is still working on a handle in its cup-with-handle base with a 49.55 buy point. Shares retook their key 50-day moving average on Feb. 22. Prior to that, shares had largely been in a period of consolidation following two failed breakouts in late 2015.Traffic rose 5.3% for the month, slightly less than the 6% capacity growth it logged in February. Load factor fell from 80.3% to 79.7%.Delta also reported an 86.4% on-time performance rate and mainline completion factor of 99.6%.""Across all entities, booking trends into the peak leisure season are strong and corporate demand remains solid as higher volumes continued to offset lower yields,"" said the company in a release.Delta, American Airlines (AAL), United Continental (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) have all recently hiked airfares.Separately, Alaska Air on Wednesday reported a 13.8% increase in traffic -- i.e., revenue passenger miles (RPM). But capacity swelled 18% as measured in available seat miles (ASM). Load factor fell 3 points to 80.4%, said the company.Several other carriers, including Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines (LUV), late last year trimmed ambitious expansion plans amid capacity concerns.Alaska Air stock fell in the morning, but rose 0.25% at the close. The stock has been forming a deep cup base since December, with shares climbing comfortably above the key 200-day level on Tuesday after finding support at the 50-day moving average on Feb. 24.United shares fell 0.8%, JetBlue shares rose 0.45% and Southwest Air 1.3%.RELATED:Why Delta Air Lines Is Accelerating Its Stock Buyback In Q1

1422,ALK,"If you're brand new to stock investing, sometimes you might wonder, in private or aloud: ""As for research, where should I start?""It's not an easy question. After all, there's the market itself, which is essentially an ocean of stocks. Plus, all of those 8,000-plus stocks get diced and sliced into 197 separate industry groups in IBD. (See the entire list of industries in Monday's ""Making Money"" section.)As you do more research and make a few trades, you eventually come to realize that mastering multiple fields is vital to making money in stocks. Those fields include the market trend; economic trends; psychological trends; your own self-psychology; portfolio management; and summoning the self-discipline to follow sound rules, both in buying and selling.Here's another field to master: how to get a strong feel for corporate earnings trends.Serious financial publications focus on earnings. Why?More than any other single factor, earnings -- or profits after taxes -- drive investor decisions in equity markets across the world. In IBD's CAN SLIM investment approach, both the ""C"" and ""A"" in the acronym point to a company's earnings results. When a company's earnings per share thrive, its stock also thrives. When earnings dive, or there is a perception on Wall Street that they will fall, so does the stock.How can you use IBD's features and Investors.com to be in the know about earnings? Take these three tips.1) Read the corporate stories on pages A1 and A2 in the newspaper or on the home page of Investors.com. The majority of corporations follow the typical calendar year ending in December in reporting financial results. So, expect a wave of earnings stories two to fours weeks after March 31 (the end of the first quarter), June 30 (end of Q2), Sept. 30 (Q3) and Dec. 31 (Q4).Let's take a peek at IBD's Jan. 22 edition. On Page A1, reporter James DeTar noted that railroad giants Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and CSX (CSX) reported ""downbeat quarter earnings"" and that analysts say ""the rail sector is clearly in recession.""How to interpret the news? First, railroad stocks have likely sold off due to profit disappointments. Secondly, these stocks may provide a valuable future opportunity in the stock market when their earnings turn higher.On the same Page A1, fellow reporter Gillian Rich covered the airlines, also in the transportation sector. While railroads have suffered from the plunge in crude oil prices and withering demand for shipping ""black gold,"" airlines have gotten a mighty EPS boost thanks to lower fuel costs. Rich's article notes that, despite the cut in fuel costs, airlines in January ""were able to raise fares by $3 for a one-way domestic ticket.""2) Check out the Company Earnings Reports tables, featured practically each day in the paper. The list bulges during the meat of earnings season. To save time in your research, note the boldfaced figures of those companies where EPS grew at least 25% on a year-over-year basis. If a company also shows an EPS Rating of 85 or higher, and it exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate, the entire line of data for that company is boldfaced.In the Jan. 22 IBD, telecom giant Verizon (VZ) (scoring a 92 EPS Rating and beating Wall Street views by 1%), Alaska Air Group (ALK) (98 EPS, 4.3% beat) and thinly traded Insteel Industries (IIIN) (98 EPS, 3% beat) all got the boldface treatment.3) Concentrate on the content regarding earnings and earnings estimates for IBD's stories in The New America and Internet & Technology sections, as well as the various minicharts found in market features such as the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and The Income Investor.

1423,ALK,"Most airlines court business customers -- or more accurately their business expense accounts -- but Hawaiian Airlines is finding success catering primarily to vacationers in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim.Mai Tais and pupus, truly friendly skies and an on-time record that’s the envy of the industry: these are the competitive advantages of the airline and its parent, Hawaiian Holdings (HA). Its unique model focuses sharply on bringing an island-like experience to its patrons.“It really caters to the leisure customer,” CRT Capital analyst Michael Derchin told IBD. “Maybe 1% of their market is business.""Derchin, who has a buy rating on Hawaiian, says he initiated coverage with a buy rating back in February 2014, when the stock was trading around 11. Now it's approaching 50.“It’s been a grand slam home run,” he said.Hawaiian, which expanded into Australia in 2004 and began daily service to Tokyo’s Haneda airport in 2010, has been growing its long-haul business. This year, it will begin service to Tokyo’s Narita airport. Hawaiian says it flew a record 10.7 million passengers in 2015, a 4.7% increase from 2014.“The allure of Hawaii is really pretty universal,” Hawaiian Chief Commercial Officer Peter Ingram told IBD. As the middle class grows in Korea and China, the airline expects to fly more Asian tourists to Hawaii, he said.Ingram notes that Japan has always had a big presence in Hawaii and that tourism from Japan is rising with the strengthening yen. The airline currently flies from Hawaii to Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Tahiti, Japan, South Korea and China.He also said that Hawaiian offers service to smaller cities on the Pacific Rim, such as Auckland in New Zealand, Brisbane in Australia, and Japan's Sapporo, that “don’t register on the map of the big carriers.” Though, after Hawaiian began service to Auckland, American Airlines (AAL) started flying there too, says Ingram.And of course, the airline outpaces everyone on inter-island flights within the Hawaiian chain, with about 160 daily departures.“We understand travel to Hawaii better than anyone. We’re prepared to take on any competitor who enters the market,” said Ingram.All of the big three U.S. carriers, American, United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) compete with Hawaiian for the mainland-to-Hawaii business. Alaska Airlines (ALK) and Virgin America (VA) also offer flights. And Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways also flies to Hawaii from Japan.Additionally, wags have predicted for years that Southwest Airlines (LUV) would enter the Hawaii market. But it won’t happen this year, says Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen & Co., who spoke with IBD.“Southwest doesn’t have any aircraft with extended over-water operations certification,” she said. “It would take about a year to get ... certified from the FAA on the existing fleet. And we would know if they applied for it. … They haven’t, so we don’t view Southwest as a short-term threat.”Becker rates Hawaiian at market perform. She says the stock is at a high valuation, but adds, “They’re a very strong competitor on the West Coast, and they’ve been growing aggressively.”For each of the past 12 years, Hawaiian has led U.S. carriers in on-time performance, according the U.S. Department of Transportation. And the airline is noted for its top-notch service; it even still serves food, included in the fare on mainland-to-Hawaii flights.It’s also adding luxury to its liners. In October 2015, Hawaiian said it will put lie-flat seating in its Airbus (EADSY) A330 premium cabins.“Those airplanes do all our long-haul flying outside Hawaii,” said Ingram. Hawaiian’s customers are couples or families, he said. And unlike business travelers, they don’t necessarily want isolation.“We’ve worked to custom design” the seats to accommodate our customers, he said. “We will have planes with these seats in the second or third quarter of this year.”Ingram says the majority of Hawaiian's A330s will be retrofitted by the end of 2017.The airline is also adding the A321 NEO to its fleet this year -- a single-aisle, smaller long-haul aircraft. It will enable Hawaiian to fly more cost-effectively from smaller locations on the West Coast of North America to Hawaii, said Ingram.The airline's net income for its fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, more than tripled to $37.9 million from $11.1 million in the year-earlier period. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rocketed up to 66 cents from 17 cents in the year-earlier quarter.Yet, total revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter to $574.2 million from $574.8 million. For the full year, total revenue grew a bit to $2.32 billion from $2.31 billion. The company’s revenue took a hit from foreign-currency impacts, reduced fuel surcharges (from lower fuel costs) and thus lower total fares, as well as higher capacity from competitors, which put pressure on the fares in North America, Ingram said.So what’s fueling the jump in income and earnings on declining revenue? Well, cheap fuel. For the fourth quarter, Hawaiian’s aircraft fuel costs dropped 41.4% to $88.4 million from $150.8 million.Asked if Hawaiian would stockpile or hedge fuel at the current low prices, Ingram demurred: “We do hedge fuel, but we’re not speculators.”Zack’s puts Hawaiian’s first-quarter 2016 earnings at 73 cents a share and full-year 2016 earnings at $4.57 per share. But both Derchin and Becker estimate Hawaiian will earn $5 per share for 2016.Not long ago, its stock price was at 5. Hawaiian (in business for 87 years) went through its second bankruptcy in 2003-2005, and its stock was still bumping along at a dismal 5 to 6 from 2011 through early 2013, when it finally started climbing. In the past year, the stock has jumped up from a low of 19.66 in mid-March 2015 to 52-week intraday high of 46.98 on Wednesday.“We’re feeling very optimistic about our prospects for 2016,"" Ingram said. ""We’re seeing flatter comparisons on foreign exchange, and we’re seeing continued strong demand throughout our network.”

1433,ALK,"With epic profits from cheap fuel, Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Continental (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) have found themselves more able than they have in years to treat passengers to free snacks, more legroom and other amenities that could survive a recession and force the hands of budget carriers.How much further airlines can go with their extra cash remains a question, though analysts don't expect too much of a hit to earnings from improvements in service.As airlines try to please passengers, they’re also trying to accommodate employees and investors who rode out bankruptcies, the financial crisis, surging oil prices, layoffs and other cost cuts.“Overall, they’re growing in the right way, which is a hard thing to say historically about airlines,” Argus Research analyst David Coleman said. “I think this is more important than getting a week-old turkey sandwich.”He also stressed that airlines are likewise investing in things passengers don’t always notice: profit-sharing, reducing debt and investing in fuel-efficient planes. Those moves aim to keep carriers competitive in the long term, when oil prices come back up.“If you’re making a whole bunch of money right now, and you start giving everyone free meals and drinks, they’re going to get used to that,” Coleman said. “So then when you cut them away when fuel prices go back up, they’re going to be screaming, ‘Why don’t I get my free rum and Coke?’ ”Improved service would come as complaints from passengers jumped 30% in 2015, according to Transportation Department data.Free snacks have largely returned on the major airlines after years of austerity, but free meals on shorter flights likely won't come back.
"
1434,ALK,"Carriers are also investing in new planes, including ones from Boeing (BA) that have more overhead space. Delta Air Lines and United Continental are trying to draw more business travelers with on-time commitments. American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK) are planning more comfortable ""premium economy""-style seating. JetBlue (JBLU) is exploring ways to improve customer and operational service through Big Data and artificial intelligence.Delta also has tested pre-loading carry-ons into overhead bins to hasten the boarding process. Cowen analyst Helane Becker sees airlines reconsidering how they approach boarding and fees this year, saying airlines probably have their current fees backwards.“They should have charged for overhead bin space and let you check your bag for free,” she said.
"
1435,ALK,"Still, checked-bag and other fees, which began when oil prices jumped, almost certainly aren’t going anywhere despite today's low prices, as customers grow accustomed to fees, analysts say. (Southwest Airlines (LUV) still allows two checked bags for free as long as they are within certain weight and size limits.)And as more passengers bring their own mobile devices aboard, some industry watchers say airlines could move away from in-seat entertainment. That would free up seat space for passengers -- plus remove weight from planes and save fuel.The new perks come as bigger airlines try to differentiate themselves from carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which grew by offering cheap airfares, tacking on fees elsewhere, and doing so with a bit more irreverence than many would expect from a public company.But in May, American Airlines’ CEO Doug Parker told Bloomberg the airline would “compete aggressively” with low-cost airlines, after they pushed airfares lower and moved in on territory the bigger airlines left amid the recent merger wave.The efforts seem to have had some success. Increased competition, along with abysmal on-time performance and complaints of minimal customer service, have weighed on Spirit’s profit and share price.The bigger airlines are now feeling safe enough to raise airfares again, hiking them in some key markets this month and last.“If you’re a low-cost or ultra-low-cost guy, and American, Delta, United compete against you, and they offer a better product, you have to think about stepping up your game and at least offer a comfortable seat or an on-time or operationally effective product,” Becker said.In the company’s most recent earnings call, Bob Fornaro, Spirit’s new CEO, said the company would make customer service a priority this year but added that no sweeping changes would take place.“In the era of higher oil prices, SAVE got away with being an unpleasant travel option with poor operational reliability because they materially undercut competitors on price,” Wolfe Research said in a note discussing Spirit’s Q4 earnings. “And they were irreverent about it. It was funny at the time, but in hindsight it was also an unsustainable way to do business.”Wolfe added: “So maybe the upshot of lower oil prices is that low oil prices will force change that will be better for SAVE in the long run. And, after that, SAVE will have better growth options.”As speculation of a recession intensifies, JPMorgan, which believes airlines’ profit margins would stay strong in a downturn, doesn’t see in-flight improvements going away.“Only in the event of multi-year profit pressures would we expect recent amenities to be scaled back,” JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker told IBD via email.Cowen's Becker, however, said that what airlines cut depends on the downturn’s causes and impact.“Certainly the rhetoric has been ‘This time it’s different, and they will be profitable,’ ” she said. “But if you’re adding cost by offering new products, you’re increasing your labor costs, and fuel costs rise, you better raise your ticket prices pretty quick.”

1436,ALK,"Hawaiian Holdings (HA) is showing strength in the stock market today, surging in quick turnover on the heels of its quarterly earnings report late Tuesday.The airline topped earnings and sales estimates, with the bottom line spiking 113% while sales dipped a fraction.Shares jumped 12% in big volume Wednesday, retaking the key 50-day moving average.

1444,ALK,"Shares of several major airline stocks moved sharply lower in morning trading Wednesday after domestic giant American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) lowered its unit revenue and unit cost guidance for the second quarter.American said it expects unit revenue—the ever-important total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) metric—to improve 1% to 3%, down from its previous guidance of 1.5% to 3.5% growth. This would still mark American’s seventh consecutive quarter of TRASM growth, but the company cited lower-than-anticipated domestic yields as the reason for its lowered guidance.Meanwhile, American lowered its outlook for Q2 capacity to 72.9 billion available seat miles from 73.1 billion and increased its estimate for average fuel prices to $2.24 - $2.29 per gallon from $2.18 - $2.23 per gallon.American also said that a technology issue which resulted in one of its regional carriers, PSA Airlines, cancelling about 3,000 flights last month would reduce pre-tax income by about $35 million.Shares of American Airlines were down more than 6% to touch an intraday low of $36.59 in early morning trading Wednesday. Elsewhere, “Big Three” rivals Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and United (UAL  -  Free Report) were both more than 3% lower.Budget airlines and regional carriers were also affected by the industry-wide slump. Alaska (ALK  -  Free Report) dropped as much as 5%, Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) tumbled about 2%, and Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report) was down roughly 4%.Overall, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) slumped about 2% in morning trading.The airline industry continues to struggle in the face of rising fuel and labor costs, shifting trends, and global economic uncertainty.

1446,ALK,"The already struggling airline stocks suffered further blow yesterday when the key sector participant — American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) — trimmed its view for second-quarter unit revenues. The bearish view for the key metric naturally disappointed investors. Consequently, the American Airlines stock was pummelled following the bleak guidance, closing the trading session on Jul 11 at $35.96, down 8.1% over the Jul 10 close.However, the damage was not limited to American Airlines and other key sector participants like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) also felt the heat and declined significantly yesterday. Consequently, the sector tracker — the NYSE ARCA Airline Index — shed 2.4% of its value on Jul 11.What Did American Airlines Say?American Airlines revealed the damaging forecast at an Investor Update. Citing softer-than-expected yields in the domestic market, the airline behemoth trimmed its guidance for total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The carrier now expects the metric to grow approximately between 1% and 3% on a year-over-year basis. The earlier guidance had called for the metric to grow approximately in the 1.5 - 3.5% range. Heightened competition in key domestic markets was primarily responsible for weak prices. Moreover, with oil prices on an uptrend, with a 14% increase in the April-June period, American Airlines increased its second-quarter forecast for average fuel prices per gallon. The metric is now expected between $2.24 and $2.29 (previous guidance: $2.18 - $2.23).Additionally, the carrier expects its pre-tax income to be hurt to the tune of $35 million due to the computer failure at American Airlines’ regional carrier PSA Airlines, last month. The carrier’s operations went haywire as a result of this disruption and it had to call off more than 2, 500 flights.Pre-tax margin is expected in the band of 7.5% to 9.5%.The only favorable part of the update was regarding the second-quarter guidance on cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel and other special items. The metric is now expected to increase in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year over year. The earlier guidance had called for the metric to grow approximately in the 2.5-4.5 % range. Lower-than-expected maintenance costs primarily led to the new projection.Gloomy Sectoral PictureAmerican Airlines’ bearish projections on TRASM and fuel costs further highlight the fact that the overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is anything but positive ahead of the earnings season. This is mainly because oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up more than 20% so far. Apart from geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are likely to limit bottom-line growth for carrier in the second quarter. Also, capacity-related woes might prevent airlines from flying high in the current earnings season. Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014 despite the recent resurgence.Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April, May and June. Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies. Customer-related issues represent another headwind for airlines.For example, the flight 1380 incident on Apr 17 is still hurting Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). In fact, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier trimmed its unit revenue view for the soon-to-be reported quarter mainly due to soft bookings on its flights after the unfortunate mid-air incident, which claimed one life and injured many.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #213, which places it at the bottom 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Industry Underperformance YTDJudging by shareholder returns so far this year, it seems that headwinds like high fuel costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is part of the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year to date.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 18.2%, the Zacks Transportation Sector has gained 3.5% of its value. Meanwhile, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has rallied 4.7% on a year-to-date basis.YTD Price Performance  Dump These Carriers from Your Portfolio NowIn view of the above challenges confronting carriers, we believe the second quarter earnings season can turn out to be more of a disappointment for airline players.Given this gloomy background, we pinpoint four airline players which investors would do well to get rid of. All the stocks have an unfavorable Zacks Rank and have witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions recently.(You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here). Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) is a low-cost carrier based in Ireland. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This European carrier has been suffering from unrest on the labor front for quite some time. Moreover, rising fuel costs are anticipated to limit bottom-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings moved south 6.8% and 7%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock.  Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. The stock has shed 7.8% of its value in the last three months.  Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), the holding company of Alaska Airlines, is based in Seattle, WA. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). High costs have been putting pressure on the company’s bottom line for quite some time, and the second quarter of 2018 is unlikely to be an exception.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and current-year earnings moved south 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively, in the last 60 days. The stock has shed 18.1% of its value year to date. SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is based in St. George, UT and operates as a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4. High operating expenses are likely to hurt SkyWest’s bottom line in the second quarter of 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings moved south 0.9% in the last 90 days. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D further highlights its short-term unattractiveness. The stock has shed 2.1% of its value over the last six months. Azul SA (AZUL  -  Free Report) is the largest airline in Brazil in terms of the number of cities served. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss for the second quarter has widened significantly at Azul over the last 60 days.Additionally, the stock, carrying a Zacks Rank #4, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 37% downward in the last 60 days and has shed 32.2% of its value year to date. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D further highlights its short-term unattractiveness. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1452,ALK,"Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) reported moderate traffic results for May. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), was up 7.4% to 3.78 billion.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) rose 9% to 4.84 billion.

Load factor was projected at 82.1% compared with 83.5% in the first five months of 2017.The decline in load factor highlights the fact that Alaska Air Group is suffering from woes related to capacity overexpansion.

The carrier will start operating non-stop flights connecting San Diego and Spokane, WA from Oct 1, 2018.Notably, the decision to launch non-stop flights connecting Washington’s second-largest city to California’s second-largest city is part of Alaska Airlines’ efforts to strengthen its footprint on the West Coast.

(SKYW  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) subsidiary, United Airlines, released their respective May traffic reports over the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jun 6, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Delta has raised its second-quarter view owing to rise in oil prices. It now expects the metric between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon. Previously, the estimate came in between $2.07 and $2.12. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range.Due to the cost headwind, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the concerned quarter. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former estimate between $1.80 and $2 (read more: Delta's Q2 TRASM View Bullish, Costs Guidance Bearish).2. Hawaiian Airlines now estimates a rise of 6-7% jet fuel consumed for the second-quarter (prior forecast had called for an increase of 5-7%). Economic fuel cost per gallon is projected between $2.05 and $2.10. Past forecast was in the $2-$2.10 band.The company has raised its outlook for fuel costs per gallon in 2018. It now predicts the metric in the $2.05-$2.15 range, higher than the earlier projection of $1.97-$2.07 (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Unit's May Traffic Up, Q2 View Bleak).3. At United Airlines, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — was 19.73 billion, up 6.7% from the year-ago figure. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 4.2% to 23.62 billion. Also, load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) expanded 200 basis points (bps) to 83.6% as traffic increase outpaced capacity expansion (read more: United Continental Arm Posts Robust Traffic Results in May).4. SkyWest reported a 6.7% (10,500) year-over-year decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) to 145,300 in May 2018. The regional carrier, which remains focused on streamlining its operations, stated that the fall in the metric was in sync with its fleet transition plans. The company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft (read more: SkyWest's May Block Hours Decline, Load Factor Up).SkyWest carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5. Although fuel costs have been increasing, air fares in the United States declined in May. Seasonally-adjusted ticket prices in the same month decreased 1.9% on a month-on-month basis, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, average air fares (unadjusted) in May declined 6.6% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the May reading marks the second consecutive month of a decrease in airfares. The decline in airfares has been attributed to the intense competition in key markets. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.6. At Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), traffic rose 4.2% while capacity expanded 5.2%. Load factor contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 84.6% in the month as traffic growth was exceeded by capacity expansion. Additionally, passenger count grew 5.3% to 14.43 billion (read more: Southwest Airlines May Traffic Up, Load Factor Down).Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, although the gains were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated marginally in the period. Over the course of the last six months, the sector tracker has lost more than 7% of its value mainly due to high fuel costs and other headwinds.  Shares of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) have declined the most (30.5%) in the period.What's Next in the Airline Space?We expect May traffic reports from the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) in the coming days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1454,ALK,"Airline stocks have been flying low on the bourses this year with the US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) having lost about 8% year to date (as of Jun 1). The first-quarter earnings season was a mixed bag for major airlines, a tick-up in oil prices being a downer.Oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. Since crude prices have steady this year as evident from the 9.8% year-to-date jump in WTI crude ETF United States Oil (USO  -  Free Report), airlines should be on guard.  Probably, this is why global airlines recently cut their forecast for industry profits in 2018.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated that the industry is expected to register $33.8 billion in profits this year, down 12% from the prior forecast of $38.4 billion. Other factors that led to the guidance cut were increasing interest rates and a spike in geopolitical tensions.Inside the Looming CrisisIATA expects oil price to average $70 a barrel this year, up from $54.90 last year and its earlier guidance of $60. Lower-than-expected crude inventory built, U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and the result of the ongoing OPEC output cut boosted oil prices significantly this year (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Per IATA, profit forecast for 2018 will likely be 4.1% of about $750 billion sales. Since 4% is not a compelling margin, IATA believes that the industry is in a delicate condition. Moreover, the ongoing trade tensions are another cause of concern as these could result in a drop in passenger count or air cargo. Notably, the United States and China announced tariffs on each other. Plus, U.S. tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico were put into effect on Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products (read: Trade War Tensions Flare Up: Must-Watch ETFs & Stocks).Inside Our Earnings PredictionAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key airline stocks’ earnings prediction is shaping up. According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) stocks are best avoided.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.11%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates in Q2.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.85%, which diminish the possibility of a beat this quarter.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -11.39%, implying that a beat cannot be predicted this quarter.Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.53%, indicating reasonable chances of a beat.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.31%, again showing higher chances of beating estimates.Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.36%, implying fair chances of an earnings beat in Q2.From the afore-mentioned trend, we clearly see that though challenges linger in the space, all airlines do not face heightened risk. Oil prices need to go much higher before posing a serious threat to the industry. In this regard, investors can take a look at the pure-play airline ETF JETS.JETS in Focus The $98.8 million-fund holds more than 30 securities in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. United Continental (12.84%), Delta Airlines (12.51%), Southwest Airlines (11.21%) and American Airlines (10.78%) are the top four elements in the basket.

1455,ALK,"At its Annual General Meeting in Sydney, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) trimmed its forecast for airlines with respect to profitability for 2018. The research firm predicts that the global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion. This is much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, which was unveiled by the organization in December 2017.The world’s leading air transport group has attributed the downward revision of the current-year profitability view mainly to the rise in oil prices. Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs have also weighed on the profitability forecast.The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably to what was achieved by airlines in 2017 ($38 billion).  Moreover, 2017’s profitability figure is much higher than the $34.5 billion that was projected in December.We note that the 2017 figure of $38 billion was a record for airline companies, boosted by one-time items. Due to this reason, IATA believes that the current-year profitability forecast is an impressive one despite being lower than the year-ago figure.2018 Forecast in DetailsPer IATA, bulk of the global net profits ($15 billion) is expected to come from the North American region, which boasts of carriers like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report). The estimated figure is lower than $18.4 billion in 2017. The unfavorable comparison is again due to high costs.All the above-mentioned carriers, apart from Southwest, carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.European Airlines, which includes the likes of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), are expected to be more profitable in 2018 ($8.6 billion) than the previous year ($8.1 billion). More extensive hedging by European carriers compared to their North American counterparts have made them less vulnerable to the rise in oil prices.Other regions, namely, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are expected to generate post-tax net profit of $8.2 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2018, suffering losses to the tune of $0.1 billion.Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. The top line is however projected to increase 10.7% to $834 billion. The top line is likely to be boosted by higher passenger as well as cargo revenues. Strong demand for air travel has contributed to the 10.8% year over year growth in passenger revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-year average growth rate (5.5%).Capacity is projected to increase by 6.7% in 2018, flat year over year. According to the forecast, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) for 2016 is expected to expand 20 basis points to 81.7% due to capacity expansion being outweighed by traffic growth.Yield and unit costs are projected to increase by 3.8% and 5.8% respectively. Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 4.2%. With unit costs anticipated to outpace unit revenue growth in the current year it is natural for profitability to be hampered.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $7.80 per passenger in 2018 compared with $9.30 in 2017. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year.The expectation is also revised upward from $60 a barrel anticipated, while revealing its expectations in December 2017. Fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017).High Fuel Costs Likely to See Uptick in AirfaresIn a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented.In fact, American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) CEO, Doug Parker, hinted recently in Sydney that air travel might become more expensive in the long-term in the event of oil prices remaining high.  Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets. Capacity growth would also probably be subdued in the era of rising prices.Disappointing Price PerformanceOil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has shed 12.9% of its value so far this year, whereas the S&P 500 index has gained 2.2% in the same period.ConclusionWhat is worse is that oil prices are anticipated to increase further from the current level of around $65 a barrel, as envisioned by the IATA. With the organisation trimming airlines profitability forecast for the current year mainly due to the upsurge in oil prices, we expect the struggles for airline stocks to continue in the remainder of the year.This is likely to result in an uptick in airfares, as mentioned above. However, some market watchers believe that this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

1456,ALK,"It was a week where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) announced its decision to resume non-stop flights to Mumbai from next year. This Atlanta-based company had last operated on the route (non-stop) in 2009.Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), the parent company of Allegiant Air, also hit the headlines in the week that was cut short by a day due to the Memorial Day holiday on May 28. The company took delivery of its first US-produced Airbus A320 plane. Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) featured in the headlines too as it commenced operations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to St. Croix’s Henry E. Rohlsen Airport, thereby strengthening its Caribbean presence.Meanwhile, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, appointed Jane Garvey as the leader of its board as it strives to improve efficiency and profitability.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last  Airline Stock Roundup for May 23, 2018). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Following the resolution of the dispute with Gulf carriers, Delta said that it intends to commence non-stop flights to Mumbai from 2019. In a bid to facilitate air travel on the route, Delta aims to expand its codeshare relationship with Mumbai-based Jet Airways. Expansion of the deal would allow passengers to fly to other Indian cities.Other details pertaining to the resumption of the operation will be disclosed by Dec 31, 2018. Service will, however, start following government clearances (Read more: Delta to Resume Flights to India & Expand Jet Airways Deal).2. Allegiant took a significant step toward fulfilling its objective of transitioning to an all-Airbus fleet by year-end by taking delivery of its first US-produced Airbus A320 plane. The aircraft was delivered from the Airbus' U.S. production facility located in Mobile, AL. Additionally, the carrier reached a tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents its flight dispatchers (Read more: Allegiant a Step Closer to Maintaining All-Airbus Fleet).3. In a bid to expand further, Spirit Airlines has started flying to St. Croix from Fort Lauderdale. This non-stop service is operational thrice a week and complements the existing service to St. Thomas. Notably, the new route is the carrier’s 13th destination to the Caribbean island and the 65th destination in its network. It is also the only non-stop flight from Fort Lauderdale to the region (Read more: Spirit Expands Caribbean Base With New Flights to St. Croix).Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4 United Airlines has seen several management changes of late, highlighting the lack of stability in its management team. The most recent change saw the carrier appointing Jane Garvey as the leader of its board. In fact, Garvey is the first woman to be at the helm of the company's board. Previously, she was the head of the Federal Aviation Administration.5. On May 23, a disturbing incident involving a passenger named, Jason Felix, reportedly took place on an American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) flight (1293). According to the report, Felix abused the flight attendant besides fighting with some of his co-passengers on the Miami-bound flight from Saint Croix. All this happened merely because the flight attendant refused to serve him beer. Felix has since been arrested and might face 20 years imprisonment.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week. However, the gains were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased marginally to $106.03 in the period. Shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have appreciated the most (4.4%). Over the last six months, the sector tracker shed 6.6% with shares of Latin American carrier, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.

1457,ALK,"Airline stocks have been laid low this year, mainly due to concerns about rising fuel costs. However, this headwind was put on the back burner last Friday as oil prices declined, resulting in airlines experiencing a field day.It is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs denote one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Consequently, the fall in oil prices leads to a significant decrease in the airlines’ operating expenses, thereby aiding the stocks’ bottom-line growth.On May 25, oil prices decreased significantly to around $67.88 per barrel following reports that OPEC and Russia were discussing an increase in oil production.  In fact, oil prices had been on the downside over the past four days, thanks to the above issue.Airlines Lead Dow Transports' Rally on FridayThe Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the May 25 trading session at 10,900.06, up 0.4%.  The index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies apart from airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be deemed the true representative of U.S. transportation division.The Dow Jones Transportation Average Index includes six airline stocks, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report)     and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report).The fact that airlines heaved a sigh of relief on May 25 is evident from the index’s top six gainers being airline stocks with shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Alaska Air Group registering the maximum rise of 3.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The above impressive performance resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2.3% to close Friday’s trading session at $108.81. Additionally, the 34-member U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report), which provide exposure to the global airline industry, grew nearly 2% on May 25, ending the day at $31.19. Oil Price Plunge Follows A4A’s Bullish Summer Travel Projection  The drop in one of the largest input costs for airlines could not have come at a better time for sector participants. This is because the summer travel season is round the corner and marks the busiest time for airlines.According to Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — the largest airline trade association in the United States — the upcoming summer season (Jun 1-Aug 31) is expected to be the most hectic period for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel. Per the forecast, approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 million flyers daily) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, up 3.7% year over year.In fact, to meet the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 116,000 each day. Also, with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations. Moreover, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have added an incentive for consumers to opt for air travel.Driven by the above tailwinds, the three-month phase is likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies each day on various U.S. carriers.With the upbeat guidance already in place, the waning oil prices provide further good news to airlines. No wonder, airline stocks concluded the previous week on a high.Valuation Signals More UpsideThe attractive valuation for the Zacks Airline industry suggests that the rally on May 25 is not a one-off phenomenon and that stocks in the space remain attractive investment bets. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio —often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.3 (near the lowest point of 5.8 in a year’s time), comparing favorably with the market at large as the current EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 11.3. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly hints at more upside.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1458,ALK,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 16.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ALK due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter Earnings Alaska Air Group reported first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 11 cents from non-recurring items) of 14 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. However, the bottom line declined 86.7% on a year-over-year basis due to high costs.Revenues came in at $1,832 million, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,830.6 million. The top line also improved 5% on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, accounting for a bulk of the top line (86.8%), were also up 5% on a year-over-year basis.Operating StatisticsAirline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, rose 5.9% year over year to 12,403 million in the reported quarter. Capacity or available seat miles expanded 7.5% to 15,480 million. Load factor (percentage of seat occupancy) contracted 120 basis points to 80.1% as capacity expansion outweighed traffic growth.Total revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) decreased 2.1% year over year to 11.84 cents in the reported quarter. Yield slipped 0.7% to 13.59 cents.Operating Expenses & IncomeIn the quarter under review, total operating expenses were up 14% year over year to $1,803 million. Operating income plunged 82% to $29 million from the prior-year quarter. Fuel price (economic) was $2.14 per gallon, up 20.2%.Consolidated cost per available seat mile — excluding fuel and special items — nudged up 5.1% to 8.81 cents, mainly owing to a 19% rise in wages and related benefits.Liquidity At the end of the reported quarter, the company had $1,528 million in cash and marketable securities compared with $1,621 million at the end of 2017.Alaska Air Group exited the quarter with long-term debt of $2,062 million compared with $2,262 million at the end of 2017. Adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio was 53%, flat on a sequential basis.Q2 & 2018 ForecastFor the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel and special items, to increase approximately 4.8% year over year. For 2018, the same is projected to rise 3.5%. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to be $2.25 per gallon in the second quarter, up approximately 32%. RASM is projected to decline between 2.75% and 3.75% in the same period.Meanwhile, capacity is anticipated to expand around 8.5% in the second quarter. For the full year, the metric is likely to climb 6.5% whereas effective tax rate in 2018 is estimated to be approximately 25%.Airline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, rose 44.2% year over year to 13,554 million in the reported quarter. Capacity or available seat miles increased 41.1% to 15,612 million. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased 190 basis points to 86.8% owing to traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) increased 1.3% year over year to 11.57 cents. While total revenue per available seat mile (RASM) declined 0.4% to 13.46 cents in the reported quarter, yield declined 0.8% to 13.33 cents.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions lower for the current quarter.Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Alaska Air Group, Inc.

1459,ALK,"Last week, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)   — one of leading players in the airline space — announced a 28% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 16 cents per share (annualized 64 cents per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Jun 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 6.This latest move highlights Southwest Airlines’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward. Moreover, a look at past records reveals Southwest Airlines’ stable dividend payment history. Notably, this marks the low-cost carrier's 167th straight quarter of dividend payment.Shareholder-Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance SheetsApart from Southwest Airlines, its fellow airline companies like SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts this year. Moreover, Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, started paying dividends from October, 2017.Southwest Airlines’ board of directors also cleared a new share buyback program worth $2 billion. The new program is set to begin on completion of the existing $2-billion share repurchase authorized in May 2017.These investor-friendly measures clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the airline space. The strong balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity.While Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), SkyWest has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyWith the advent of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the financial health of airline players is likely to improve further. This is because, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others due to the significant reduction in tax bills.Consequently, an increase in the shareholder-friendly measures (dividends, buybacks) is very much in the cards for the airline space. For example, we expect Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) to hike its dividend shortly. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record with respect to dividends/buybacks.Solid Demand for Air Travel Bodes Well with Approaching Summer Airlines’ robust financial health has allowed them to make investments for improving onboard experience. Strong demand has also prompted airlines to add routes. For example, United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — recently added routes from New York/Newark and Washington-Dulles.Given higher demand for travel from New York, the carrier aims to attract traffic on the routes. Improvement in domestic economy has contributed to the upside. With consumer confidence remaining upbeat, more and more Americans are taking vacations.With demand remaining strong, we expect airlines to rake in significant profits in the upcoming summer season despite the rise in oil prices. Summers usually represent a very busy time for airlines and this year is likely to be no different. In fact, despite high fuel costs air fares had declined sharply in April, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Valuation Attractive Despite High Fuel CostsGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio — which is often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.2 (the lowest point in the last six months), which compares favorably with the market at large as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.2. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1460,ALK,"Last week, Latin American carriers — GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) — reported contrasting financial numbers for the first quarter of 2018. While Copa Holdings outperformed with respect to earnings per share and revenues driven by the improvement in the Latin American economy, GOL Linhas posted in-line earnings and lower-than-expected revenues.On the non-earnings front, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic numbers for April. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased at this low-cost carrier as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. JetBlue was also featured in the news by virtue of its agreement in principle with its pilots’ union — Air Line Pilots Association.Meanwhile, average airfares in the U.S. declined the most in four years according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies. The deal inked by the United Arab Emirates with the United States also invited attraction and should go a long way in resolving the long-standing dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts.In 2015, leading U.S. carriers — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — had alleged that state-owned carriers like Etihad Airways and Emirates gained from the massive subsidies and other benefits. Per U.S. carriers, the government subsidies were unfair in nature, which denied a level playing field to them. The above agreement aims at allaying such fears, with the United Arab Emirates agreeing to increase financial transparency.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 09, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. GOL Linhas’ earnings (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago figure. Net revenues came in at $862.2 million (R$3.0 billion), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $919.1 million. However, the top-line figure increased on a year-over-year basis.Passenger revenues accounted for bulk of the top line and improved significantly year over year. The upside was driven by the solid demand for air travel owing to improvement in the Latin American economy (Read more: GOL Linhas Q1 Earnings In Line, Revenues Miss Estimates).2. Copa Holdings’ earnings per share of $3.22 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78. The bottom-line figure surged 32.5% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly revenues too increased 15.9% year over year to $715 million and outpaced the consensus mark of $692 million. The year-over-year improvement in the top line was primarily owing to 16.3% growth in passenger revenues.While passenger unit revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) climbed 7.2%, yield per passenger mile improved 5.3%. Passenger traffic (on a consolidated basis) rose 10.4% and capacity was up 8.4% in first-quarter 2018. Load factor expanded 150 basis points to 83% as traffic growth outweighed capacity increase.Additionally, unit revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 7.2%. This apart, operating cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 1.1% in the reported quarter. The metric, including fuel costs, was up 5.6%.On a separate note, the carrier unveiled its traffic report for April. Load factor declined 10 basis points to 82.7% as capacity expansion (12.1%) outpaced traffic growth (10.8%) in the month for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. At JetBlue, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — rose 5.7% year over year to 4.3 billion. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 5.3% to 5.02 billion (Read more: JetBlue's Traffic & Load Factor Increase in April).Also, JetBlue moved a step closer to finalizing a pay-related deal with its pilots, after it inked an agreement in principle. However, the deal needs to be ratified before it becomes effective. On implementation, the same will lead to significant increase in labor costs. This, in turn, will limit bottom-line growth further as fuel costs are already on the rise.4. Although fuel costs have been increasing, air fares in the United States declined in April. In April, ticket prices decreased 2.7% on a month-on-month basis, thus making it the sharpest fall in four years. Moreover, in April, average air fares (unadjusted) declined 6.9% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the April reading comes after two successive months of increase in airfares (Read more: Air Tickets Get Cheaper in April Despite High Fuel Costs).5. At Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), RPMs came in at 4.6 billion, up 5.8%. ASMs rose 8.7% to 5.46 billion. Load factor contracted 230 bps to 84.6% as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth.On a separate note, Alaska Air Group’s subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, is reportedly aiming to do away with its New York pilot base in September. The move will see more than 100 pilots relocating to California as the carrier aims to strengthen its West Coast fleet.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA2.8%-1.2%UAL3.4%15.9%GOL-4.5%1.3%DAL1.5%3.8%JBLU1.6%-6.2%AAL2.7%-9.4%SAVE0.5%-2.9%LUV0.3%-6.5%CPA-0.6%-10.7%ALK-3.1%-10.9%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week.

1461,ALK,"Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is an important indicator of profitability and efficiency for airline companies. Higher load factor implies the company is more profitable. This is because a high load factor means that the heavy fixed costs of airlines can be spread across more passengers.Load Factors Deteriorate in AprilThis key metric declined in April for major US carriers, namely United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) unit, Hawaiian Airlines. Fall in load factor indicates inefficient capacity utilization inducing vacant seats.Each of these stocks except Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Load factor at Alaska Air Group fell 230 basis points (bps) as capacity expansion (8.7%) outpaced traffic growth (5.8%). The same decreased 150 bps, 10 bps, 80 bps and 20 bps at Southwest Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines and Delta, respectively.Capacity over growth due to contraction in load factor often causes lower airfares, thereby eroding revenues and profitability of the airline companies. In fact, air fares in the United States decreased in April per data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Per the report, ticket prices reduced 2.7% on a month-to-month basis, registering the sharpest fall in four years.Apart from declining load factors, let’s have a look at the other headwinds plaguing the airlines.Fuel CostsFuel costs have been on the rise lately due to various reasons such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices increased 5.6% in April. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC-member Iran has further spiked oil prices.Currently oil prices are hovering at around $71 a barrel. As expenses on fuel comprise a significant portion of airlines’ operating expenses, rise in the metric inflates costs, thereby limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, high fuel costs hurt American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) results substantially in the first quarter, resulting in the stock losing value post the earnings report, despite outperforming on the bottom-line front. Such exorbitant costs are expected to hamper results in the coming quarters as well. Moreover, the company trimmed its current-year earnings guidance mainly due to high fuel costs.Southwest Airlines' bottom line in the second quarter is also likely to be affected on the same ground. Economic fuel costs are projected at $2.20 per gallon, much higher than the year-ago figure. Also, at JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), fuel cost is anticipated to be $2.23, way above $1.61 reported a year ago.Labor CostsWith labor deals very much in vogue in the airline space, such costs are also on an upswing. The airline employees claim that despite the airlines generating record profits, they lag in terms of employee remuneration. This has in turn propelled frequent new labor deals across the airline industry.Moreover, per International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast, labor cost will comprise the major portion of airline expense this year. Labor costs are predicted to account for 30.9% of total expenses in the year compared with 20.5% of fuel costs. Most recently, JetBlue reached an agreement in principle with its pilots. Final ratification of the agreement by the pilots is still pending. The airline currently estimates non-fuel unit costs between 2% and 4% in the second quarter. The measure is likely to go up following ratification of the new contract. Earlier in March, Spirit Airlines, Inc. ratified its five-year deal with pilots, pertaining to wage increase.In-Flight GlitchesThe airlines have also grabbed headlines of late due to several unpleasant cases on board. Southwest Airlines made maximum headlines in this regard. A tragic incident in April sparked large-scale dissatisfaction among customers with the carrier having made an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure, which resulted in a passenger’s death with seven others sustaining injuries.Southwest Airlines has been struggling with low bookings ever since this fatal incident. In fact, the carrier issued a bearish view on unit revenues for the second quarter, thanks to the same reason. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3%. Similar occurrences took place this May as well. Earlier in the month, the carrier made an abrupt landing when one of its window panes broke.  Further adding to the woes, another Southwest Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing only a few days ago due to a pressurization issue, throwing the passengers in a tizzy.In April, a CBS News report titled ""60 Minutes"" leveled allegations against Allegiant Travel Company that the company is afflicted with a large number of mechanical problems. The report, aired on Apr 15, further stated that the poor safety standard was responsible for around 100 serious mechanical events in the January 2016-October 2017 time frame. The charges are being investigated.United Airlines also kicked up a controversy, resulting in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights in March.These untoward incidents have been dampening the airline companies’ reputation and certainly do not bode well for the sector participants.Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry fared poorly due to the headwinds, massively underperforming the broader market on a year-to-date basis. The S&P 500 index gained 2.1% against the industry’s decline of 12.9%. ConclusionDespite an air of prevalent pessimism revolving around airline stocks, we expect the companies to make a turnaround soon, buoyed by strong demand for air travel and rising air fares. With soaring oil prices, the carriers will most likely pass on the high-cost burden to passengers’ pockets. Notably, during first-quarter 2018 earnings release, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker warned of dearer ticket prices.Thriving U.S. economy augurs well for travel-focused stocks like airlines. With consumer confidence remaining strong, more and more Americans are resorting to vacations. Demand for air travel is expected to remain robust, courtesy of a much-enhanced job market and an increasing disposable income.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1462,ALK,"Oil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In fact, oil prices have climbed more than 17% on a year-to-date basis. In line with the upsurge, oil prices jumped above $70 a barrel on May 4 due to concerns pertaining to the economic crisis in Venezuela— a major oil exporter— and the possibility of fresh sanctions on Iran by the United States. This marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity, which was trading at around $30 a barrel in 2016. Airlines: Feeling the HeatIt is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Evidently, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season, which is almost over for airlines, witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period.The gloomy picture for airlines in this respect can be gauged from the fact that shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) declined after the companies unveiled their respective first-quarter earnings results late last month. This was despite the carriers reporting better-than-expected earnings. High fuel costs were primarily responsible for the stocks shedding value. While average fuel price (consolidated and inclusive of taxes) increased 23.6% year over year at American Airlines, the metric surged 21.5% at Spirit Airlines.Moreover, American Airlines trimmed its current-year earnings projection mainly on high fuel costs. The likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) also saw their respective bottom line contract on a year-over-year basis mainly due to high fuel costs.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Disappointing Price PerformanceThe struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has shed 10.8% of its value so far this year. Oil Price Surge Likely to Hurt in Q2  The upsurge in oil prices due to the above-mentioned reasons is likely to limit bottom-line growth for airlines in the second quarter as well. This is evident from the forecasts of various carriers on fuel costs for the current quarter.For the second quarter, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) expects average fuel price per gallon (on a consolidated basis) between $2.18 and $2.23, which is higher than the first-quarter figure of $2.11. At Delta, the same is expected between $2.07 and $2.12 in the second quarter, higher than the first-quarter figure of $2.01.American Airlines too expects to incur a higher amount in the second quarter on consolidated jet fuel (inclusive of taxes) compared with the first-quarter figure of $2.10 per gallon. Other carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also expect to incur significantly higher costs on fuel in the second quarter of 2018.Will Air Travel Become More Expensive?In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented. In fact, American Airlines’ CEO, Doug Parker, too has hinted at higher ticket prices. Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets.Already, Spirit Airlines has increased ticket prices (one-way) to the tune of $3. Also, other carriers are anticipated to follow suite.According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average airfares (adjusted) in the United States have already increased in two successive months this year — February and March. With fuel costs eating into the profits of airlines, fares are anticipated to increase further in the current year.However, according to Parker, even if air fares rise, they will not hurt the strong demand for air travel. An improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been the factors supporting the strong demand in the space. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.This optimism can be gauged from American Airlines' bullish second-quarter outlook on total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues), despite fuel cost woes. TRASM is anticipated to increase in the band of 1.5-3.5%. Moreover, according to some market watchers this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1463,ALK,"Airlines companies reported Q1 earnings in the last 20 days, which came in mixed. The pure-play aviation ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) did not show any improvement in this time frame. Let’s take a look at some of the key first-quarter 2018 earnings results in the industry and see if the fund can attain altitude ahead.Q1 Results in DetailOn Apr 12, Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the first-quarter earnings season in the airline space, with in-line earnings and a top-line beat. Its first-quarter 2018, earnings per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 74 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Earnings however decreased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $9,968 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,881.2 million. Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $9,148 million.In mid-April, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of 50 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. Moreover, the bottom line climbed 25% year over year owing to higher revenues. Operating revenues of $9,032 million in the first quarter also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,012.5 million and increased 7.3% year over year. Strong demand for air travel boosted revenues.Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Operating revenues of $4,944 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,017.6 million. However, the company’s Q2 guidance was bleak.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 36 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Quarterly earnings increased approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis despite higher costs. Revenues of $10,401 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,411.9 million. Strong demand for air travel led to the year-over-year improvement in the top line.Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation’s (JBLU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 27 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. The bottom line also increased 8% year over year backed by higher passenger revenues. However, total operating revenues of $1,754 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,757.6 million. Nevertheless, the top line increased more than 9% from the year-ago figure.Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 11 cents from non-recurring items) of 14 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. However, the bottom line declined 86.7% on a year-over-year basis due to high costs. Revenues came in at $1,832 million, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,830.6 million. The top line improved 5% year over year.Should You Buy JETS on the Dip?By now, one must have understood from the beat ratios that the fundamentals are mixed. Oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on the extension of the OPEC output curb deal, airlines may suffer on profit margins. Rising geopolitical risks related to trade war and chaos in Middle East are the other threats (read: Top Performing Energy ETFs of 2018).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks, faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks and seeking to play the sector on the expected benefit of the tax reform and “pricing discipline (per Bernstein)”, may target it in the ETF form. Below we highlight the fund in detail:JETS in FocusThe $99.3 million-fund holds more than 33 securities in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. United Continental (12.54%), Delta Airlines (12.00%), Southwest Airlines (11.53%) and American Airlines (10.51%) are the top four elements in the basket. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue hold the sixth and ninth positions in the fund with 4.38% and 3.97% weights, respectively. The product charges 60 bps in fees.

1464,ALK,"Over the past five trading days, several airline companies like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) reported their respective first-quarter 2018 earnings results.Even though all three carriers delivered better-than-expected earnings per share, Hawaiian Holdings was the most impressive performer. This Honolulu County, HI-based carrier outpaced earnings and revenue estimates. Moreover, both the metrics improved on a year-over-year basis. Strong demand for air travel aided results.Alaska Air Group also outperformed with respect to earnings per share and revenues. However, the bottom line contracted significantly due to high fuel costs. On the flip side, JetBlue reported lower-than-expected revenues.In fact, high fuel costs have emerged as a major headwind for airlines in Q1 and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season. Expenses pertaining to fuel represent one of the major input costs for airlines. Naturally, the rise in fuel costs does not bode well for stocks in this space.On the non-earnings front, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) dominated headlines as it seeks a new chairman following the incumbent’s decision to step down.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 6.4% to $109.84 over the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 19, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ALK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 8 cents per share for ALK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ALK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +51.53% heading into earnings season.Alaska Air Group, Inc.

1471,ALK,"Last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) kick-started the first-quarter earnings season for the airline space. This Atlanta, GA-based carrier reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share. However, high fuel costs contributed to a year-over-year decline in earnings.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the quarter. Results were aided by strong demand for air travel and higher ticket prices. This Chicago-based carrier’s decision to trim its capacity growth plans in the current year is also encouraging.On the non-earnings front, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) grabbed headlines for a wrong reason. Shares of the carrier tanked following a news report aired on television, which questioned the safety standards on its flights. Currently, the allegations are being investigated by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) invited the attention of regulators, after an engine on one of its planes (Boeing 737-700) exploded mid-air. To make matters worse, one of the passengers on that ill-fated flight expired.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) also featured in the headlines by virtue of its bullish view on first-quarter unit revenues. The company was in the news due to labor-related issues as well. Flight attendants at this low-cost carrier voted in favor of joining the Transport Workers Union. By doing so, they have become the second labor group to be unionized at JetBlue. In 2014, the carrier’s pilots joined the Air Line Pilots Association.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline index increased 1.1% to $113.60 over the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 11, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

1472,ALK,"Airline stocks are unlikely to grab major headlines in the first-quarter 2018 reporting cycle, which will see reports from many sector participants in the coming days. High fuel costs are likely to limit bottom-line growth in the reporting cycle. Moreover, multiple flight cancellations due to foul weather is also likely to weigh on results. In fact, high fuel costs have hurt the results of the two carriers — Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — who have reported thus far. For example, fuel costs increased approximately 20% at Delta. Moreover, the winter storms hurt results to the tune of $44 million at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Atlanta, GA-based carrier. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. In fact, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures. Given the inversely proportional relation between oil prices and airline stocks, this increase in crude prices is expected to hurt results for the carriers who are still to report their first-quarter numbers. In fact, fuel prices are likely to be on uptrend this year. The International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) projects that jet fuel prices will escalate to around 12.5% to $73.8 per barrel in 2018. The fuel bill is likely to account for 20.5% of total costs in 2018 (18.8% in 2017). Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front and capacity-related woes represent further challenges for sector participants. Zacks Industry Rank Supports Ongoing Struggles The Zacks Industry Rank #177 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline Industry highlights the fact that airlines are certainly not in favor, as far as investors are concerned. This unfavorable rank places the companies within the bottom 31% slot of the Zacks industries. We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank  Not All Brickbats, Some Roses Too Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, there are some factors that are favorable for sector participants. The unit revenue scenario is steadily improving, which is a huge positive for the sector. Riding on the improved scenario, the likes of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) have issued bullish unit revenue views for the first quarter. What is more encouraging is the fact that the bright scenario with respect to this key metric is unlikely to fade soon. For example, Delta expects total unit revenues, excluding refinery sales, to increase in the 3-5% range in the second quarter of 2018. Furthermore, rising fuel costs might lead to a rise in ticket prices and boost revenues.   Strong demand for air travel also bodes well the sector. For example, Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — a premier trade organization — for U.S. carriers unveiled an upbeat forecast for the current spring season. Per the projection, airline companies are expected to profit considerably this spring (Mar 1-Apr 30) as travel demand is anticipated to increase 4% year over year. Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) is a positive for airlines and should boost profits of the participants of this key sector. Apart from boosting results, the new law should see an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends/buybacks) in the space. In fact, the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to follow suit in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The employee-friendly attitudes of most carriers can also be attested to their robust financial statuses. For example, in February 2018, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) announced that it will pay $543 million to its employees as part of its 2017 profit sharing plan. This (the 44th consecutive profit sharing arrangement) is in addition to the bonus of $1,000 (to each eligible employee) declared last month, following the introduction of the new tax law. The 2017 payment equates to approximately 11.3% of each employee’s earnings in the year. Moreover, the solid balance sheets of most carriers are allowing them to invest significantly in fleet upgrades. For example, American Airlines recently inked a fleet modernization deal worth $12 billion with The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). On the same lines, Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) — recently executed a non-binding Letter of Intent for buying 10 Boeing Dreamliners. The first of the fuel-efficient, lightweight Boeing 787-9 aircraft is expected to join its fleet in the first quarter of 2021. Moreover, Hawaiian Airlines has options to purchase 10 more such planes. Valuation Picture Even though, airlines are expected to put in a modest performance in the first quarter due to the above-mentioned headwinds, the valuation picture for the sector is attractive, highlighting a value-oriented path head. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio of 6.5 — near the highest level of 7.4 seen in the last six months. The measure is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses. When compared with its own average of 6.7 over that period, the industry doesn’t appear to have any upside. However, the space actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA for the S&P 500 is 11.6 and the median level is 11.8. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market calls for a solid upside in the quarters ahead.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Â¿Â¿Â¿Â¿Â¿Â¿Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1473,ALK,"Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings and better-than-expected revenues. The bottom line plunged massively on high costs while the top line showed substantial improvement on higher passenger revenues.Let’s see how things shape up for this earnings season.Factors at PlayPersistent high labor and fuel costs are likely to hurt the carrier’s bottom line in the first quarter. Notably, the carrier expects cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items to rise approximately 5% in the quarter. While economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to grow 19.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter CASM excluding fuel is pegged at 9 cents, above 8 cents, reported a year ago. While the consensus mark for economic fuel cost per gallon stands at $1.97, higher than $1.78 in the first quarter of 2017.The issue of capacity overexpansion has been ailing the company for quite some time now and might hamper its first-quarter results as well. Notably, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined during the January-March period. The metric contracted 50 basis points, 80 basis points and 230 basis points in March, February and January, respectively. Load factor fell in each of these months due to traffic rise outpacing capacity growth.Expanding capacity implies increase in costs and cheap air tickets. Low air fares reduce unit revenues of carriers, thus affecting the top line. Capacity is anticipated to expand around 8% in the to-be-reported quarter.The carrier has been struggling on the unit revenue front, which might further affect results in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger unit revenues-mainline stands at 9 cents, lower than the previous quarter’s 10 cents.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. During the first quarter, it announced a dividend hike of 7% to 32 cents per share, higher than the previous count of 30 cents.Earnings WhispersPer the Zacks proven model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Alaska Air has an Earnings ESP of -15.04% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 17 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 15 cents.

1474,ALK,"Shares of Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) — the parent company of Allegiant Airlines — declined 3.1% on Apr 16, closing the trading session at $146.40. A television program aired on Apr 15 highlighting the multiple mechanical problems on Allegiant’s flights, contributed to this sharp decline. Earlier, the Allegiant stock had slipped further to the tune of 8.6% on Apr 13, following reports that the show will be telecast in two days’ time.The Damaging ReportCBS News' report, ""60 Minutes"", painted a gloomy picture of the airlines, alleging that it was facing a number of safety-related issues. The report further stated that the poor safety standard was responsible for around 100 serious mechanical incidents in the January 2016-October 2017 time frame.  Per the report, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) carrier’s operations have been crippled by multiple aborted takeoffs, in-flight mechanical problems and emergency landings in recent times owing to the below-par safety standards. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Naturally, 60 Minutes has invited attention from law makers who called for an enquiry regarding the system failures. The report also showed the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in poor light, alleging that the long-standing mechanical issues at Allegiant persisted due to FAA’s slackness.However, Allegiant has vehemently denied the allegations, attaching various adjectives like “unoriginal, ""outdated"" and “false narrative”. The FAA has also stated that it does not compromise with safety issues and has welcomed an enquiry.Despite the denials, we believe that Allegiant’s passenger traffic will reduce at least in the short term. This is because passengers might be skeptical to fly on Allegiant, unless a report emerges clearing the carrier of the allegations.Allegiant apart, issues related to customer service have hurt airlines like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) in recent times.Unimpressive Price PerformanceWe note that the Allegiant stock has performed disappointingly even before the damaging report went public. Notably, the stock has declined 16.9% in the past month.In fact, until clarity on the above issue is obtained, shares of this low-cost carrier might continue declining in the coming days.  Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1475,ALK,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17, after the market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.3%. Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings history, with the metric surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 10.3%.However, the scenario pertaining to this quarter does not seem too bright. This is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 2.9% downward in the last 60 days.Factors at PlayWeakness in the automotive sector poses a major challenge to CSX. This is because the company draws a major portion of revenues from this sector. Hence, sluggish automotive revenues might hurt the top line in the first quarter.Additionally, declining coal production in the current year is likely to hamper first-quarter results. A drop in U.S. coal exports coupled with the decline in usage of coal for electricity generation in the United States are hurting production of the commodity. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for coal revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $529 million, below $541 million reported in the previous quarter.The company’s high-debt levels further add to its woes. This is indicated by its current long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio of 80.1, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s figure of 66.3%.However, the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, implemented by the company's former CEO E. Hunter Harrison is anticipated to boost results in the period to be reported. The new model is likely to drive the top line on the back of volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and intermodal segments.The new tax law should also boost profits for the company, leading to bottom-line growth in the first quarter.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are also impressive. In February, the company announced a 10% dividend hike. In light of the new tax law, we expect an upswing in such shareholder-friendly moves, resulting from sums of huge savings owing to the reduced tax rate.Growth of the intermodal sector is also anticipated to aid the top line this earnings season. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $448 million, above $434 million, recorded a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of -1.71%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

(AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — issued upbeat first-quarter unit revenue views over the past five trading days.We believe that strong demand for air travel contributed to the bullish projections. This apart, quite a few companies including the likes of United Continental’s subsidiary — United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) revealed respective traffic data for March.  American Airlines’ $12 billion fleet modernization deal with The Boeing Company was another highlight of the week.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 04, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines reported impressive traffic results for March.

Strong demand for air travel coupled with improving yields might have led to the bullish view.Pre-tax margin (excluding special items) is now anticipated between 4% and 5%, reflecting an improvement from the previous guidance of 2-4%.

1479,ALK,"The current projection for Q1 earnings season is very encouraging. Per the latest earnings preview, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.4%. The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year. Out of which, 11 are projected to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.One of those sectors is the transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 14.3%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration bode well for the sector.The Q1 earnings season will be kicked off by Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) on Apr 12. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Multiple Headwinds Hurt Airlines in Q1Airline stocks had a rough time in the January-March period mainly due to weather-related disruptions. Notably, key players in this space had to cancel multiple flights in the first quarter due to quite a few storms in the first quarter. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations.In fact, in March, there were reportedly more than 10,000 flight cancellations due to successive nor’easters. It is believed to be the worst month in five years in this regard. The increase in the number of flight cancellations in the first quarter resulted in significant revenue losses for airline operators and this is likely to hurt top-line growth in the upcoming earnings season.Additionally, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. On Mar 21, crude had jumped above the psychologically important $65 per barrel level, representing a spectacular recovery from the $26 a barrel mark touched in late February 2016. In fact, the first quarter of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014.We note that high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures. Given this backdrop, we expect high fuel costs to limit bottom-line growth of carriers in Q1.Zacks Industry RankThe above struggles for the airline space is well reflected by the bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 169 carried by the 27-member Zacks Airline industry. Notably, the unfavorable rank places the industry in the bottom 34% of the 250+ groups. We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half outpaced the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The Zacks Industry Rank for this sector has also improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankSome Prevalent TailwindsDespite the above-mentioned challenges, there are a few bright spots in the sector. Evidently, the unit revenue scenario is steadily improving for airline stocks. This can be made out from the bullish Q1 unit revenue forecasts from leading carriers like Delta and United Continental.The improved unit revenue projections highlight the strong demand for air travel on the back of a buoyant U.S. economy.  Furthermore, the bullish forecast for spring travel by the Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — a premier trade organization — highlights the improvement on the revenue front. In fact, strong demand for air travel backed by an improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income is likely to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate on multiple downward revisions due to the above headwinds may not make earnings outperformance too difficult for carriers in the soon-to-be reported quarter. For example, the Zacks Consensus for the first quarter of 2018 at United Continental is 27 cents per share, comparatively less than the year-ago figure of 37 cents. Moreover, in the preceding quarter, the consensus mark for earnings in was pegged at $1.34 at United Continental. Naturally, the lowered bar should make it easier for companies to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1.In view of the above commentary, it would not be a bad idea to add airline stocks, despite the above-mentioned hiccups, to one’s portfolio for handsome returns.Selection of OutperformersWith the airline space being densely populated, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology might provide some relief.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.

The metric increased 4.7% and 0.6% on the domestic and international fronts, respectively.

1483,ALK,"The past week in the airline space was mostly about numbers, with several airline companies like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) reporting their respective third-quarter 2017 earnings results.Markedly, the common trend in the quarterly reports of the above-mentioned companies was the year-over-year decline in earnings due to higher costs. Apart from high labor costs, rise in oil prices also hurt the bottom line as fuel-related expenses increased. In addition to high costs, back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the earthquake in Mexico also distorted the earnings picture.Despite the headwinds, most sector participants reported better-than-expected earnings per share in Q3. In view of these headwinds, the earnings per share estimates have been trimmed over the past few months.With the bar (pertaining to earnings estimates) being lowered significantly, courtesy the drastic downward revisions, it is of little surprise that most carriers have managed to beat the (highly conservative) Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter.Moreover, the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 4.5% to $106.42 over the past five trading days. This further substantiates the fact that the series of earnings beat in the airline space have failed to cheer investors.The only notable update on the non-earnings front came from the Airlines for America (“A4A“). The leading trade group, predicted that 28.5 million passengers will opt for air travel in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 17 – Nov 28), implying a 3% increase from the 2016 figure. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Oct 25, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. American Airlines’ third-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding 14 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.42 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. However, quarterly earnings declined significantly on a year-over-year basis due to high costs. Results were also hurt by the recent hurricanes. Revenues of $10,878 million were 2.7% above the year-ago figure (read more: American Airlines Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, Fall Y/Y).2. Southwest Airlines reported better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues in the third quarter of 2017. The carrier’s earnings per share (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 88 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. The bottom line, however, declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenues of $5,271 million lagged the consensus mark of $5,296.6 million but improved 2.6% year over year. Passenger revenues accounted for the bulk of 90% (read more: Southwest Airlines Beats on Q3 Earnings, Misses Revenues).3 Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.24 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.25. Revenues came in at $2,120 million, below the consensus estimate of $2,166.2 million.The top line, however, rallied 35.4% on a year-over-year basis.

Allegiant Travel Company’s third-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.39 per share, 2 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line, however, contracted 49.5% on a year-over-year basis, due to high costs. Hurricane Irma also hurt results as the company had to cancel multiple flights due to the calamity.Quarterly revenues increased 4.6% year over year to $348.8 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $350.1 million (read more: Allegiant Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Sales Miss).6. According to a forecast by A4A, approximately 28.5 million passengers are expected to avail the services of U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday period this year, up 3% year over year. The forecast translates into 2.38 million fliers per day during the period, which is an increase of 69,000 from the comparable figure last year.Passenger volumes (on a daily basis) is projected to be in the range of 1.61 million to 2.88 million. The busiest day for the holiday period is expected to be Nov 26. The lightest travel day is expected to be the Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 23, 2017. Markedly, cheap ticket prices are one of the main reasons behind the bullish forecast. To meet the surge in demand, carriers are adding more seats (86,000 per day).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-19.5%-38.3%UAL-2.4%-16.7%GOL-9.5%34.8%DAL-6.1%10.1%JBLU-5.9%-12.3%AAL-9.8%9.8%SAVE9.7%-35.2%LUV-8.4%-4.2%CPA-2.1%6.8%ALK-17.1%-22.4%                  The table above shows that all airline stocks apart from Spirit Airlines traded in the red in the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index’s significant decline.

But investors should note that most of the stocks have a good Value Score of A or B. This makes the space a value play.  However, oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on an extension of the OPEC output curb deal, airlines may suffer on profit margins (read: Q3 Earnings to Drive Energy ETFs Higher).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks and faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks, may play the recent dip in the space.

1485,ALK,"The last week saw key airline players like JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) announcing their respective third-quarter 2017 numbers. While JetBlue and United Continental outperformed with respect to both earnings and revenues, Hawaiian Holdings reported mixed results. This Honolulu County, HI-based carrier reported better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues.Despite the earnings beat, shares of United Continental fell approximately 12% on Oct 19. The lack of clarity provided by the company, on the conference call, pertaining to its efforts to check costs and boost revenues disappointed investors. Consequently, the stock tumbled, registering its biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years.European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) also grabbed headlines by virtue of its dispute with pilots.

For full-year 2017, the same is forecasted to grow in the band of 5% to 6%.Capacity is projected to grow between 4% and 6% in the final quarter of 2017. CASM, excluding fuel, is also projected to rise significantly for the ongoing quarter primarily due to the higher labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is anticipated in the band of $1.75-$1.85 for the fourth quarter. The metric is expected in the band of $1.65 to $1.75 for full-year 2017.4.

1487,ALK,"The Q3 earnings season is picking up pace with multiple companies reporting earnings everyday. According to the latest Earnings Preview, by the end of this week 267 S&P 500 companies will release their quarterly numbers. Out of them, 180 will be reporting during the course of this week.Per the report, the entire S&P 500 fraternity is projected to end the Q3 reporting cycle with bottom-line growth of 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 5%.  These projections compare unfavorably with the readings in Q2, when revenues increased 5.5% and earnings expanded 11.2%. In fact, the timid Q3 projections are reflective of the headwinds including back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the devastating Mexico earthquake.The highly diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has been hit severely by the above mentioned natural disasters as well. This is because the sector includes travel focussed stocks such as airlines. Markedly, the gloomy picture for this sector is reflected by declining earnings projection for Q3 to the tune of 14.9% year over year. The estimated growth in revenues is pegged at a modest 4.5% compared with an impressive growth of 10.1% in Q2.Turbulence Awaits Airlines in Q3?Given that the airline stocks form an integral part of the transportation sector, it is needless to say that this particular space is undergoing a rough phase mainly due to the natural calamities. Even though the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have outperformed in Q3, results of these carriers have been hit hard by the hurricanes.Evidently, Delta's pre-tax income was reduced to the tune of $120 million in the third-quarter due to Irma as it had to call of multiple flights. Meanwhile, United Continental cancelled 8,300 flights owing to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Consequently, its third-quarter pre-tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately $185 million.Moreover, surging costs (fuel as well as labor) have resulted in year-over-year bottom-line contractions for both these legacy carriers. Of late, fuel costs are on the rise with oil prices crossing the $50 a barrel threshold mark. This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks. The trend is expected to continue in the remainder of Q3 with high costs hurting the bottom line of carriers.In fact, unfavorable scenario substantiates the bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 245 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 4% of the Zacks industries.In this adverse situation, investors interested in the airline space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report),Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) on Oct 25.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.

As the increase in traffic outpaced capacity growth, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 84.1% in the month.For the first nine months of 2017, Copa Holdings generated RPMs of 14.83 billion (up 13% year over year) and ASMs of 17.82 billion (up 8.6%). Load factor registered a rise of 320 bps year over year to 83.2% during the period.With the earnings season on, several major airline companies are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings numbers next week.

1489,ALK,"The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in Las Vegas on Oct 1, 2017.The massacre at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino reportedly claimed 59 lives apart from injuring many. The shooter, identified as Stephen Paddock from Nevada, opened fire from the 32nd floor at the audience of the music concert.Initial reports suggest that the Las Vegas gunman, who is also dead, did not bear allegiance to any terrorist organization and acted alone.  However, the indiscriminate shooting, is an act of terror according to laws in the state of Nevada.Airlines Swing Into ActionFollowing the gruesome incident, flights to and from Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport were temporarily halted. However, services have been resumed and the airlines that have exposure to the McCarran International Airport have swung into action.Allegiant Airlines, owned by Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), was offering free flights to victims and their families. Shares of the company, which offers flights connecting Minot and Las Vegas, naturally took a hit and declined 1.3% on Oct 3. Currently, Allegiant Travel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) Virgin America and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) reportedly allowed waivers (with conditions attached) on travel charges for those intending to delay and rebook Las Vegas trips.What’s in Store for Airlines?It is a well-documented fact that acts of terrorism have the potential to ground airline stocks due to the possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears. In this regard, travel to Las Vegas is likely to be hurt in the next few days, thus impacting tourism as Las Vegas is a favorite tourist spot. As a result, travel-focused stocks, which include airlines, are likely to be on the back foot.Unfortunately, acts of violence are on the rise and airline stocks were badly hurt previously. The Orlando mass shooting in June 2016 led to airline stocks crashing. Other acts of terror across the globe like 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Brussels attacks also spelt doom for airlines.Against this backdrop, we expect U.S. airline stocks to shed value due to waning travel demand to Las Vegas, at least in the short term. This will result in decline in top line. However, only time will tell the extent to which revenues are actually hurt. Therefore, we expect investor focus to remain on the issue, going forward.Airlines Already Reeling Under Multiple HeadwindsWhatever the final outcome, the timing of the mass shooting could not have been worse as airline stocks are already struggling due to various other factors. Evidently, back-to-back natural calamities (Harvey and Irma) disrupted airline operations significantly. Rising fuel costs are also hurting airlines. The headwinds are likely to adversely impact the third-quarter results of carriers.In fact, many U.S. carriers including the likes of American Airlines, United Continental, Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) have already trimmed their unit revenue views for the third quarter owing to the headwinds.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 233 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the plight of the airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 9% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over a decade, using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankPrice PerformanceThe dim outlook of the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The industry has declined 4.7% against the S&P 500's gain of 3.7%With stocks in the airline space already struggling, the Las Vegas shooting incident might hamper the travel plans to one of the most attractive tourist spots, which is a matter of concern for the sector participants.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1490,ALK,"Embraer SA (ERJ  -  Free Report) recently won a firm order from SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), the holding company of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Airlines, for delivering 20 E175 jets.Order DetailsAt current list prices, the order is estimated to be valued at $914 million, which will be added to Embraer’s third-quarter 2017 backlog.The order includes 15 E175 SC (Special Configuration) aircraft in a 70-seat configuration. The E175 SC aircraft has an E175 airframe that can be retrofitted to 76 seats going forward. Additionally, it comprises order for five E175s, in a 76-seat configuration similar to the aircraft that SkyWest had ordered earlier.The transaction will take the total number of E175 jets booked by SkyWest in 2017 to 45. Notably the airliner had ordered 25 new jets from Embraer in September. The payment for all 45 aircraft will be made using $161 million in cash and the balance in debt. While delivery of the E175s is expected in between September and early 2018, the E175 SCs are expected to be delivered in the next year.Markedly, SkyWest Airlines will operate the E175s for Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and the E175-SCs for Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report).A Brief Note on E175 JetsThe E175 jets have a 76-seat dual class pattern, including 12 First Class seats, 16 Economy Plus seats and 48 Economy seats.The E175 jet also features a wingtip for enhanced aerodynamic performance. Moreover, this new fleet of the model is 6.4% more fuel efficient than the first-generation E175s. Over the last few years, Embraer has been able to grab the lion’s share of 80% of orders for airplanes in its class from airline companies in the United States.Our ViewWe note that Embraer is the only company that manufactures a family of four airplanes for the 70-to-130 seat segment. While the program was launched in 1999, the first E-Jet entered into revenue service in 2004.Commercial Aviation revenues represented 61.5% of the company’s total revenue in the second quarter, reflecting substantial improvement from 27% last year. Notably, the company delivered 35 commercial aircraft in the same quarter, up from 26 jets on the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company has a series of healthy contracts and tie-ups with other companies for its jets. As a result, Embraer continued to witness strong demand for its E-jets, thereby booking several orders in the second quarter.Moreover, armed with 3,500 flights and a fleet of 678 jets, SkyWest offers commercial air service in various cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean as well. SkyWest Airlines also has partnerships with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, US Airways, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. Therefore, such strong tie ups with this airlines will surely benefit Embraer’s profit margin in days ahead.Price MovementShares of Embraer have declined 30.2% in the last year, as against the industry's gain of 49.3%. This underperformance may have been caused by the weakening Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the softness observed in the company’s Defense and Security business remains a concern.Zacks RankEmbraer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The new route will be operated on Virgin America’s Airbus A320 family of aircrafts, featuring power outlets across the cabin, food and beverages, inspired by local chefs, besides several other modern amenities.With this service, the carrier intends to expand its Bay Area footprint with 18 new markets. By this year-end, Alaska Airlines and Virgin America hope to grow by covering 42 destinations from the major Bay Area airports. The carrier, like its fellow airline operators, American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) has been constantly looking to expand its operations.

1492,ALK,"While designing the portfolios, investors solely aim at raking in handsome returns. Hence, they prefer adding the well-performing stocks to their portfolios and get rid of the underperformers.One such stock that investors would do well to avoid for the time being is Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report). We’ll tell you why.High Costs Likely to Hurt Q3Of late, Alaska Air Group has been laid low by escalating costs and the third quarter is likely to be no different. Evidently, pilots of Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, approved an amendment to the existing eight-year pay-related contract in May 2017. This, in turn, has contributed to the spike in labor costs as pilots' compensation has shot up following the amendment.Following the agreement, Alaska Air Group projects current-quarter cost per available seat mile (excluding fuel and other special items) between 8 cents and 8.05 cents. Even though positive on the Virgin America deal, we note that this transaction like any merger has integration risks attached to it. In fact, merger-related costs contributed to the 50% rise in total operating expenses (on a reported basis) in the second quarter of 2017. Notably, merger-related costs are likely to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter as well.Moreover, the increase in fuel costs are expected to limit bottom-line growth. Fuel cost is projected to be $1.76 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting an improvement of approximately 12% over the year-ago figure.In fact, weather-related headwinds like Harvey have hurt not only Alaska Air Group but other airline players as well.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, it is natural that the stock is not a favorite of brokers right now. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 9.2% downward over the last 60 days.Furthermore, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions, given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers. Markedly, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Additionally, Alaska Air Group’s Momentum Score of F highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Price PerformanceShares of Alaska Air Group have struggled so far this year, due to the above headwinds. Consequently, the stock has underperformed its industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has been down 15.7%, as against the industry’s gain of 9.6%.In ConclusionTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds and the unfavorable readings, we advise investors to avoid the stock at the moment. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) carried by the stock also suggests the same.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same space that the investors can consider are SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report), Air France-KLM SA (AFLYY  -  Free Report) and Deutsche Lufthansa . While Air France and Deutsche Lufthansa sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SkyWest holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

1493,ALK,"Stocks in the airline space have been going through tough times of late. Major airline companies are severely hurt from the consecutive impacts of Harvey and Irma. Consequently airline stocks have lowered their guidance for the upcoming quarter.The airline companies are expected to reveal third-quarter 2017 earnings numbers next month. With the tropical storms bearing heavily on the airline companies, the scenario for future looks very grim.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsSeveral airline companies have trimmed their third-quarter outlook, primarily due to natural disasters.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, the worst hit from Harvey has reduced views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter. The carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of +1% to -1%).The carrier currently expects pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous outlook had called for the metric to be in the range of 12.5-14.5%). Higher fuel prices are also estimated to hamper the bottom line in the third quarter. Fuel price per gallon is now projected in the band of $1.72-$1.77 (earlier view: $1.56-$1.61). Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, profit-sharing, third-party business expenses and other special items are now projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% (earlier outlook had called for a rise in the 2-3% range).The Chicago-based company now expects capacity to grow between 3% and 3.5% compared with the approximate 4% expansion projected earlier.Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) with significant exposure to Houston expects the top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to natural calamity. Currently, Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the current quarter to fall between 7% and 8.5% (the earlier guidance had called for a drop in the band of 2-4%). Aggressive competitive pricing in key markets also contributed to this bleak forecast.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also trimmed outlook for the third quarter due to stiffer competition and higher fuel costs. The carrier now estimates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to improve in the range of 2-3%. Past view had called for growth in the 2.5-4.5% band. The airline also raised outlook for fuel prices to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket on the back of upsurge in market price, which began in late July.Apart from the above carriers, the likes of JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also cut their respective unit revenue views for the third quarter. American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects TRASM to grow at a slower pace in the third quarter due to difficult year-over-year comparisons.High Labor CostsSteep labor costs have been hitting the airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the future scenario also seems dull and the metric is expected to affect the third-quarter results as well.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 202 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the plight of the airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 21% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the past decade, using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankPrice PerformanceThe dim outlook of the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months.

1494,ALK,"In the last week, key airline players like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) revealed their respective traffic data for the month of August.While the traffic reports of Latin American carriers — GOL and Copa Holdings — were impressive, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines’ performance was disappointing. Evidently, both the U.S.- based carriers reported a decline in their respective load factors (percentage of seats filled by passengers). The downturn was due to traffic growth being outpaced by capacity expansion at JetBlue as well as Spirit Airlines.Moreover, the Bureau of Transportation Services revealed that average airfares in the United States had declined in the same period.  Notably, the August reading marked the second successive month of price weakness.Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) — also grabbed headlines by virtue of its announcement to expand operations in New Zealand from March 2018.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnOn the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 2% to $106.15 over the last week. (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Sep 13, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At JetBlue, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — improved 5% year over year while consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 5.4%. But Augustload factor decreased 30 basis points to 87.1% (read more: JetBlue's August Load Factor Declines, Stock Falls).2. While traffic at Spirit Airlines increased 20.6%, capacity expanded 21.9%. Meanwhile, load factor decreased to 86.2% from 87.1% recorded in August 2016. Additionally, this low-cost carrier registered a completion factor (system wide) of 96.6% for the month with 76.9% flights on schedule (read more: Spirit Airlines' August Traffic Increases, Load Factor Slips).3. GOL Linhas’ shares were positively impacted following the release of impressive August traffic data.

Load factor increased 140 basis points to 85.1% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion for the month (read more: Copa Holdings Traffic, Load Factor Rise in August).5. Average air fares in August fell 3.2% from the comparable figure a year ago. Also, the price of air tickets decreased 6.1% (unadjusted) in the same month on a month-on-month basis.According to research firm Hopper, air fares (roundtrip) in the United States are likely hit a low of $216 in October (read more: U.S. Air Fares Continue to Decline: Should Airlines Worry?).6. Buoyed by strong demand, Hawaiian Airlines intends to start operating up to five non-stop flights (weekly) between Auckland and Honolulu from Mar 21, 2018. In 2013, the company had started operating thrice a week flights connecting the two destinations. Markedly, these flights have carried more 260,000 passengers since inception, thus leading to the company’s expansion plans.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and during the past six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-7.2%-24.6%UAL-6.1%-14.7%GOL9.2%57.4%DAL-3.8%2.2%JBLU-6.2%-3.9%AAL-4.6%6.4%SAVE-6.8%-36.1%LUV-1.3%0.2%CPA-2.4%17.2%ALK-6.1%-23.8%                  The table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from GOL Linhas, which traded in the red over the last week, led to the substantial decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. In fact, the GOL Linhas stock was buoyed by its impressive August traffic report that emerged as the biggest gainer (9.2%) in the period.Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has depreciated 3%. Spirit Airlines emerged as the biggest laggard (declining 36.1%) due to multiple headwinds like the pilot dispute and the Harvey impact. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) too have witnessed double-digit declines in the same period.What's Next in the Airline Space?Apart from the usual news updates, investors are expected to look forward to updates on the Hurricane Maria and its impact (if any) on airlines.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

1495,ALK,"The airline industry has been struggling of late, especially from the back-to-back impact of Harvey and Irma. The airline stocks are lying low as investors begin to worry over their ability to recoup losses incurred from the onslaughts of successive calamities.Another source of pessimism surrounding the stocks comes in the form of persistent high labor costs. The rise in fuel costs is also worrisome for airlines.Harvey & Irma ImpactsHurricanes Harvey and Irma have had devastating effect on the airline industry. Thousands of flights were canceled and fuel costs inflated. As was widely expected, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, was the worst hit from Harvey as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. More than 7,400 flights were called off at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, with operations suspended at the airport due to the inclement storm for more than four days.With the onset of Irma on the other hand, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) is expected to be the worst hit. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has two hubs at Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, apart from Puerto Rico. Following Irma, the carrier cancelled more than 860 flights.

The company now anticipates third-quarter 2017 total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) in the range of flat to up 1% year over year. Previous projection had called for a 0.5-2.5% rise in the metric. Due to higher fuel costs for the quarter, the company currently estimates third-quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to vary between 8.5-10.5%. The prior view was in the range of 10-12%.Other major airline companies like United Continental Holdings, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have also reduced projections for the third quarter.Persistent High Labor CostsSteep labor costs have been hurting the airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the future scenario also seems grim and might hurt the third-quarter results as well.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 160 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the woes of airlines.

1496,ALK,"It was a week where there were quite a few updates in the airline space. The most eye-catching development was Delta Air Lines Inc.’s (DAL  -  Free Report) upbeat unit revenue forecast for the first quarter of 2018. Strong demand for air travel coupled with increasing yields contributed to the bullish forecast from this Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth.Airlines received another piece of good news, when the sector participants scored impressively on the punctuality front in January 2018, per the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The DOT was also in the news when it granted tentative permission to five U.S.-based carriers to operate new scheduled flights to Havana. The decision became necessary as many carriers had terminated their operations between the nations due to lower-than-expected demand.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, was another news maker in the week that had a day less of trading owing to Good Friday. Notably, the company’s new chief executive officer (CEO), Peter Ingram, is reportedly unperturbed by Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) decision to commence service to Hawaii soon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 28, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. According to the Air Travel Consumer report, most U.S. carriers were more punctual in reaching their destinations in January compared with the year-ago figure. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), secured the top spot with 88.9% of its flights arriving on time in the same month.Moreover, the findings suggest that fliers were pleased as the number of complaints decreased during the month on a year-over-year basis (Read more: Airlines Kick Off 2018 With Impressive Punctuality Data).2.The DOT has proposed that Delta will operate an additional round of daily flights connecting Miami and Havana. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), which already operates four daily flights between the cities, has also been granted tentative permission to conduct an additional roundtrip on the route.Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), which already has a significant Cuban presence, has been permitted to operate additional flights on the Fort Lauderdale-Havana route (six times a week), apart from launching service between Boston and Havana on Saturdays.The new allocations, however, have to be implemented within three months of the receipt of the final clearance from the government. Following final approval, Southwest will operate additional daily flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Havana.Finally, United Airlines and its code-share partner Mesa Airlines have received a tentative approval from the DOT to extend its Houston-Havana Saturday service to a daily operation. However, the decision led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot (Read more: Why Airlines Tanked After DOT's Tentative Cuban Clearance).3. Delta issued an encouraging outlook with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the first quarter of 2018 and expects the metric to improve by approximately 5% (the earlier outlook on the metric had called for an improvement in the band of 4-5%).The company still envisions first-quarter earnings per share to lie between 65 cents and 75 cents. While pre-tax margin is anticipated to increase in the range of 6.5-7.5%, capacity expansion is still expected to be around 3% for the quarter. The carrier expects higher costs to pressurize its bottom line in the quarter due to weather-related expenses and wage hikes, among other factors.Consequently, the company increased its first-quarter projection for non-fuel unit costs. The metric is now projected to increase around 4% on a year-over-year basis (the highest point of its previously anticipated range of 3-4% increase).On a separate note, Delta reported an increase in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for March. The metric was up110 basis points to 86.9% in the month as traffic growth (4.3%) outweighed capacity expansion (3%). Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance of 86.9% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99%.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4. According to Hawaiian Airlines’ CEO, Peter Ingram, that the company is making constant efforts to modernize its fleet. The carrier is also looking to expand its Asian operations. Ingram also stressed on the need to make its presence felt among investors in a bigger way. This is because it operates from remote Honolulu. Moreover, he believes that though airlines are now in a better financial health, they are still vulnerable to economic downturns. 5. European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), reported encouraging traffic data for March backed by cheap ticket prices. The carrier transported 10 million customers in the month, up 6% year over year. Load factor increased 100 basis points to 95%.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA 4.3% -2.4%UAL1.4%7.3%GOL1.4%39.5%DAL-1.4%4.2%JBLU0.4%4.2%AAL0.6%1.5%SAVE-0.1%4.7%LUV-1.3%-4.1%CPA 0.0%-1.4%ALK-2.2%-25.6%                  Stock prices of airlines fluctuated immensely during the week.

1497,ALK,"The airline companies heaved a sigh of relief post Monday’s dramatic fall. This is because shares of key airline players rose yesterday, signaling a big upside and a healthy first-quarter 2018.Sector participants, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report), et al saw a substantial rise in respective stock prices at the close of business on Apr 3. As a result, the sector tracker, NYSE ARCA Airline Index, climbed 3% on the same day.While United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the other above-mentioned stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that the likes of Delta, American Airlines, United Continental, Alaska Air Group and Southwest Airlines had suffered sharp declines in stock prices on Apr 2. This downfall was due to fears of intense competition in the Havana route following the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) decision to grant five U.S.-based leading carriers a tentative approval to operate new scheduled flights in the popular tourist spot.Let’s delve into the factors leading to the stocks’ recovery:The Bounce BackThe price surge of major airlines on Tuesday followed after Delta provided an impressive guidance for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase approximately 5%, i.e, in the high end of its previously guided range of a rise between 4% and 5%. The upside has been driven by strong demand and higher yields. Positive results from all geographic entities and the outperformance of international unit revenues over Delta’s domestic counterpart also contributed to this positive scenario. Additionally, the carrier expects tax rate of around 23% for the first quarter.However, cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and profit sharing is now anticipated to expand around 4%. The earlier view had called for 3-4% growth in the metric. The downside has been attributable to wage increases in April 2017 and a rise in depreciation on aircraft retirements. Weather-related expenses also weigh on costs to the tune of 0.5 points.The airline maintains its projection for first-quarter earnings per share between 65 cents and 75 cents. Also, its outlook for pre-tax margin remains unchanged at an expansion of 6.5-7.5%. The carrier’s capacity forecast is fixed at 3%. While its prediction for average fuel price per gallon is unaltered at $2-$2.05.Robust March TrafficSimultaneously, the airline reported encouraging traffic statistics for March. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 18.95 billion, up 4.3% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3% to 21.8 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers augmented 110 basis points to 86.9% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance of 86.9% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99% in the month.In the first three months of 2018, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 49.28 billion (up 2.8%) and ASMs of 59.46 billion (up 2.7%). Thus, load factor remained flat at 82.9% in March compared with the year-ago figure.The Near-Term ProspectThe airline industry took off to a bumpy start in the first quarter. Bad weather conditions played a spoiler from the very beginning of the year. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March largely crippled airline operations due to multiple flight cancellations.Weather-related disruptions have continued in the current month as well with a snowstorm forcing airlines to call off many flights. In fact, 466 flights in/out of the United States were cancelled on Monday in the wake of the storm.Moreover, Southwest Airlines’ recent guidance cut for first-quarter unit revenues lead to tumbling of other industry players’ shares. Also, in January, United Continental’s commentary on fourth-quarter 2017 conference call that it will continue to increase capacity for the next three years in order to hold market share in the industry caused a decrease in share prices of other sector players.However, steep demand for air travel and the likely solid first-quarter results are anticipated to ease the pessimism revolving around the industry in the near-term.Notably, first-quarter results will possibly benefit from a shift in the timing of Easter this year. This is because demand for travel is usually high during the Easter week. Last year, Easter celebrations fell in mid-April.Impressive Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry has gained 1.7% in the last six months, marginally outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 1.3% appreciation. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1498,ALK,"Airline stocks made a nightmarish start to this week with key companies like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report),United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) witnessing steep declines in stock prices on Apr 2. Naturally, the sector tracker — NYSE ARCA Airline Index — also decreased significantly (to the tune of 3.3%) on the same day.Why the Downturn?While continued fears of a U.S.-China trade war and the tech sell-off played a significant role in the Monday mayhem, there was a sector-specific issue as well. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recently awarded (tentatively) five U.S.-based leading carriers to operate scheduled flights to Havana.The DOT decision to allocate new US-Havana frequencies became necessary, following the decision of many carriers like Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) to terminate operations between the nations due to lower-than-expected demand. Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the decision led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot. In fact, in a bid to attract customers, a price war may emanate between the U.S. carriers.  To match the low fares of carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest, legacy carriers namely Delta and American Airlines might follow suit which is likely to trigger a price war.The Award The DOT has proposed that Delta will operate an additional round of daily flights connecting Miami and Havana. American Airlines, which already operates four daily flights between the cities, has also been granted tentative permission to conduct an additional roundtrip on the route. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways, which already has a significant Cuban presence, has been permitted to operate additional flights on the Fort Lauderdale-Havana route (six times a week), apart from launching service between Boston and Havana on Saturdays.Following the final approval, Southwest will operate additional daily flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Havana. Finally, United Airlines and its code-share partner Mesa Airlines have received a tentative approval from the DOT to extend its Houston-Havana Saturday service to a daily operation.The new allocations, however, have to be implemented within three months of the receipt of the final clearance from the government. Notably, the DOT had to reject other applications for additional flights to Havana as the agreement between the United States and Cuba allows only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations.Other Headwinds Plaguing Airlines This YearApart from the fears of competition intensifying on the Havana routes, stocks in the airline space have hurt been by other headwinds as well.  Foul weather has been hurting airlines since the beginning of the year. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations.Weather-related disruptions have continued in the current month too with a snowstorm forcing airlines to cancel many flights. In fact, 466 flights in/out of the United States were cancelled yesterday due to the storm.  Southwest’s bleak view, with respect to operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM), for first-quarter also dented stocks in the space.So far this year, the Zacks Airline industry has declined 6.1% due to the headwinds.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1499,ALK,"Shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $57.60 during the trading session on Apr 2 before retracing a bit to close at $57.74. The stock has underperformed its industry in a year, having declined 36% versus the industry’s 13.4% rally. Reasons Behind the Stock’s PlungeHigh costs have been burdening the company’s bottom line for quite some time and the fourth quarter of 2017 was no exception. Rising costs are likely to hamper first-quarter 2018 results too. Notably, the carrier expects cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items to increase approximately 6% year over year. Additionally, economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to ascend 18% in the first quarter. Also, high labor and fuel costs plus expenses pertaining to the Virgin America acquisition might hit the company’s earnings going forward.This apart, the company has been struggling on the unit revenue front. Last quarter, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) fell 5.1% year over year. A continuous below-par performance of this key metric will probably affect the stock significantly.Woes related to capacity overexpansion are also hurting the company. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined in the first two months of 2018. In February, it contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 79.4% as capacity expansion (9%) outpaced traffic growth (7.9%). While in January, the metric deteriorated 230 bps.The pessimism revolving around the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 being pegged at a loss of 14 cents per share. The consensus mark has been lowered from the previous earnings estimate of 58 cents in the past 90 days. Detailed results will be available on Apr 23. Moreover, the Zacks consensus estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 12.9% downward.The company’s unimpressive Momentum Score of F further highlights its short-term unattractiveness. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report) and AZUL SA (AZUL  -  Free Report). While Atlas Air Worldwide sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), United Continental and AZUL carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1500,ALK,"The first month of the current year appeared impressive for American fliers as far as punctuality is concerned. According to the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation for January, most U.S. carriers were more punctual in reaching their destinations compared with the year-ago figure. Moreover, the findings suggest that fliers were pleased as the number of complaints decreased during the month on a year-over-year basis.Punctuality StatisticsAccording to the report, 79.6% flights operated by U.S. carriers touched down on time. This represents a marked improvement from the comparable figure of 76% in January 2017.Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) secured the top spot with 88.9% of its flights arriving on time during January. Hawaiian Airlines, which is owned by Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), United Airlines, a subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) , and  Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) were the next three most punctual companies recording on-time arrival rates of 88.3%, 84.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Notably, a total of 18 carriers were considered in the report.However, January’s on-time arrival rate was a tad below the comparable figure of 80.3% recorded in December 2017.Disappointing PerformersPer the report, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) emerged as the least punctual U.S. airline with only 65.8% of its flights arriving on time during the month. This low-cost carrier has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) wholly-owned subsidiary PSA Airlines was second from below recording an on-time arrival rate of 70.2%. SkyWest, Inc.’s (SKYW  -  Free Report) ExpressJet Airlines occupied the third-lowest spot, recording on-time arrival rate of 74.6%.Cancellations Rise But Complaints DeclineThe findings also showed that the number of cancellations increased during January 2018. In fact, the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 3% from 2% and 1.2% in January and December 2017, respectively. In this regard, Hawaiian Airlines emerged as the topper, with only 0.2% of its flights being cancelled in the same month.In the meantime, PSA Airlines was the worst performer in this respect, with 7% of its flights cancelled in January 2018. Moreover, the report stated that 12 domestic and 32 international flights had tarmac delays exceeding the permitted duration of three hours and four hours, respectively. Winter storm Grayson, which battered the East Coast in the first week of the year also contributed to the high cancellation rates.However, the brighter aspect of the report came with respect to the significant year-over-year decrease in the number of consumer complaints related to airline service, filed with the government. Evidently, in January 2018, 1,451 complaints were filed, which represents a 12.2% decrease from the comparable figure of 1,653 a year ago.Airlines Hurt by Multiple Cancellations in 2018The rise in the rate of cancellations witnessed in January is likely to continue in the remaining two months of the first quarter of 2018, particularly March. In fact, in March, there were reportedly  more than 10,000 flight cancellations due to successive nor’easters.It is believed to be the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations. The increase in the number of flight cancellations in the first quarter resulted in significant revenue losses for airline operators.We believe that the Zacks Airline industry's  disappointing price performance in the first quarter was primarily due to weather-related disruptions and the resultant revenue losses.

1501,ALK,"It was a week that saw the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 4.1% mainly due to the disappointing unit revenue forecast of low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) for the current quarter. The Dallas-based carrier attributed the downbeat forecast to pricing pressure and lower-than-expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays.Apart from the bleak forecast, airlines were also hurt by the emergence of another nor’easter (Toby) in the Northeast region. In fact, this was the fourth nor’easter to hit the region this month. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) was also in the news over the past five trading days regarding its fleet upgrade efforts.Moreover, the week saw American Airlines and United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report)    — issuing updates on their plans to add additional flights in a bid to expand their presence.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 21, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Southwest Airlines now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be flat, as against the year-ago figure of 13.23 cents. The projection compares unfavorably to the previous forecast of year-over-year growth between 1% and 2%. However, current customer demand remains strong, according to Southwest. The carrier still continues to expect year-over-year RASM growth in 2018.Further, the company has lowered its outlook for first-quarter operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense. Additionally, first-quarter fuel costs are expected to be at approximately $2.10 per gallon (Read more: Airline Stocks Decline on Wednesday's Trading: Here's Why).2. Airline operations were disrupted when Toby hit the Northeast, resulting in multiple flight cancellations. In fact, the current month has reportedly seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor’easters. Notably, it is believed to be the worst March in five years time in terms of flight cancellations (Read more: Airline Operations Disrupted Due to Another Nor'easter).3. According to a Reuters report  American Airlines has ended its negotiations with Airbus to buy multiple planes, in a bid to upgrade its fleet. Replacing Airbus, as a potential supplier to American Airlines was The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). American Airlines is reportedly looking to purchase 25-30 new wide-bodied jets. The deal with Boeing might be valued between $7 billion and $8.5 billion.On a separate issue, American Airlines announced its intention to launch flights to four cities — Georgetown, Guyana, Pereira, Colombia, Cordoba, Argentina, Oaxaca, Mexico and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The new routes will be operational subject to government clearance. Tickets will be available from April 2018.American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The association between United Airlines and Air New Zealand was strengthened when the carriers announced their decision to operate flights connecting Chicago and Auckland. The non-stop year-round flights, operated by Air New Zealand thrice a week, will commence from Nov 30, 2018. Moreover, United Airlines announced that its flights connecting San Francisco and Auckland, which currently operate on a seasonal basis, will fly throughout the year (thrice a week) from April 2019. The service has been expanded to cater to the increased demand.5. Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — inked a deal with Irish carrier, Aer Lingus, for providing members of its Mileage Plan more opportunities to earn and redeem miles to Europe. According to the new partnership, the carriers will commence interline availability across their respective networks from April 2018. Aer Lingus currently operates flights connecting Dublin and 13 cities in North America. The carrier will operate flights connecting Seattle and Dublin from May 18, 2018.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows most of the airline stocks traded in the red over the past week mainly due to Southwest’s bearish guidance. Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 6.9%, on the back of impressive gains at Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.

1502,ALK,"Stocks in the airline space have been hit by inclement weather repeatedly this year. Weather-related disruptions cripple airline operations, leading to multiple flights being cancelled. In fact, the current month has reportedly seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor’easters. Notably, it is believed to be the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations.  Another Nor'easter Hits: Multiple Flights CancelledFoul weather continued to hurt airline operations, throwing travel plans haywire, as the fourth nor’easter hit the Northeast this month. Similar to the earlier storms, the current one (winter storm Toby) too has resulted in heavy snowfall accompanied by strong winds in the region.Consequently, travel plans were disrupted causing harassments to passengers. The  severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that more than 4000 flights were cancelled in the United States by various carriers on Wednesday. In fact, flight cancellations hit operations severely at major airports like, LaGuardia, JFK and Newark Liberty, in the New York city area.The Fort Worth, TX-based American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) led the list of cancelled flights, calling off 577 flights on Wednesday. Other airline players like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) were not spared of the miseries either and had to cancel multiple flights.While American Airlines holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the other carriers mentioned above carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Woes Not Yet OverWhat is worse is that the woes are likely to continue, though not as severely as on Wednesday, resulting in more flight cancellations and revenue losses for airline operators. In fact, more than 600 flights into/out of the United States are expected to be cancelled today.Moreover, gusty wind is expected to blow in the affected areas confining people to their homes and disrupting travel plans. Apart from the damaging winds, severe power outages are anticipated in parts of the Northeast.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including United Continental, American Airlines, Delta, Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) are offering travel waivers.Toby- Related Woes Coincide With Southwest’s Bleak RASM ViewWednesday turned out to be a nightmarish day for airline stocks. This is because, apart from their operations being crippled due to Toby, Southwest Airlines’ disappointing unit revenue forecast for the current-quarter resulted in most sector participants trading in the red.The Dallas-based carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be comparable with the figure of 13.23 cents achieved a year-ago. The projection compares unfavorably to the previous forecast of year-over-year growth between 1% and 2%. Pricing pressures and weaker-than-expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays contributed to the downbeat forecast.As a result of the weak RASM guidance, shares of Southwest lost 4.8% of their value, ending the trading session on Mar 21 at $57.78. The losses were not limited to only Southwest as other major carriers too felt the heat and declined. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline index decreased 1.2% on the day to $119.97.Headwinds to Hurt Q1?Back-to-back natural calamities had hurt airline operations last year as well. However, the sector bounced back post the calamities. In the last six months, the Zacks Airline industry rallied 14.9%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 8.9%.Given this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether the successive storms this month and Southwest’s bleak current-quarter unit revenue forecast dampens the sector’s recovery. The headwinds might hurt revenues significantly, thereby adversely affecting the carriers’ first-quarter 2018 results, which should be announced next month.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1503,ALK,"We have issued an updated research report on Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report). The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.Reasons Behind the DowngradeHigh costs have been putting pressure on the company’s bottom line for quite some time, and the fourth quarter of 2017 was no exception. Moreover, rising costs are likely to hamper first-quarter 2018 results too. Notably, the carrier expects cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items in the ongoing period to rise approximately 6% year over year.  Additionally, economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to grow 18% in the first quarter. Apart from these, high labor and fuel costs plus expenses pertaining to the Virgin America acquisition might hit the bottom line going forward.The company has also been struggling on the unit revenue front. Last quarter, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) decreased 5.1% year over year. A continuous below-par performance of this key metric will probably affect the stock significantly.The negativity revolving around the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being pegged at a loss of 13 cents per share. The consensus mark has been lowered from the previous earnings estimate of 47 cents in the last 60 days.The company’s unimpressive Momentum Score of F further highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have declined 12.8% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 2.3%. Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the airline space are International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY  -  Free Report), AZUL SA (AZUL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report). While International Consolidated Airlines sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), AZUL and American Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Shares of International Consolidated Airlines, AZUL and American Airlines have rallied more than 11%, 13% and 18%, respectively, in the last six months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1504,ALK,"Shares of Ryanair (RYAAY  -  Free Report) surged to a new all-time high on Monday amid what has otherwise been a rough day across much of the market. And with no major Ryanair-related news to speak of, now is a great time to look at some of the company’s current fundamentals and latest happenings to see why investor confidence remains sky high.Ryanair’s stock price climbed over 1% to reach a new intraday trading high of $127.59 per share—in contrast to some of the biggest tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which caused the broader S&P 500 to sink (also read: Why Are Tech Stocks Tumbling Today?).Today’s gains are also part of a much larger move that has seen the discount European airline power’s stock price soar over 50% in the last year, including a 19% surge over the last 12 weeks.Recent News Ryanair released its February traffic results in early March and showed solid customer growth.Traffic grew 5% from the year-ago period to reach 8.6 million customers. Ryanair also reported a 95% load factor and noted that its rolling annual traffic climbed 9% to 130 million customers.Last week, Ryanair announced that it will add Turkey to its roster of destinations as part of a larger European expansion. The country, which had experienced a decline in overall tourism, has seen a recent uptick that Ryanair hopes to capitalize on.The discount airline company also recently rolled out a solution to its German pilot issue that led to a brief strike late last year. This move could prove vital as Ryanair continues its push in Germany.Passenger numbers at the Frankfurt airport are in fact expected to climb by as much as 6%, based on a recent report from German airport operator Fraport. Frankfurt, which is one Europe’s busiest airports, is projected to see its passenger numbers reach a high end of 68.5 million, up from 64.5 million in 2017.The company noted that Lufthansa and Ryanair’s expansion are expected to drive a large portion of this growth.More Fundamentals Ryanair is expected to see its revenues jump by more than 24% this quarter to reach $1.55 billion, based on our most recent Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is also projected to see its earnings climb by 11.5% to touch $0.29 per share.The airline firm’s full-year sales are expected to hit $8.31 billion, which would mark a nearly 14% climb. Looking even further down the road, Ryanair is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 17.3% over the next three to five years. This extended bottom line growth projection should encourage investors as the company looks poised to boost profits while spending money to expand into new markets throughout Europe.Bottom LineRyanair is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock is trading at a 17x earnings, which is a slight premium compared to the rest of the “Transportation – Airline” industry. This seems to be based on investor confidence for long-term growth compared to airlines such as Alaska Air (ALK  -  Free Report), Air France-KLM (AFLYY  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report).The company’s stock price might also seem a little steep as it just reached an all-time high. But comparatively, at its current price, Ryanair’s Forward P/E looks cheap against where it stood as recently as May of last year.With all of that said, now might not be a bad time to scoop up Ryanair as a continued surge could be on the horizon.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1505,ALK,"Shares of SkyWest, Inc.  (SKYW  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $60.65 on Mar 16, before retracing a bit to close the session at $60.3. In fact, the stock has performed very well in the past six months. While SkyWest has rallied 43.2%, the Zacks Airline industry gained 16.5%. Catalysts Behind the Impressive Price PerformanceSkyWest’s constant efforts to modernize its fleet and streamlining its operations are impressive. Also, the company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft. To this end, it reported a decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) in February 2018. For the first two months of the year, the carrier reported a 2.8% decrease in block hours.Moreover, SkyWest has a robust earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing 14 quarters. Evidently, in fourth-quarter 2017, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier performed impressively, reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenues. We expect SkyWest to continue performing well in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, a solid earnings track record generally works as a catalyst in boosting the stock price. This is because it indicates the company’s ability to surpass earnings estimates. More often than not, investors take into account a company’s buoyant earnings history while betting on the stock with the expectation that it will continue outpacing estimates in its next releases.Furthermore, SkyWest’s expansion-related efforts are impressive. Also, its efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks raise optimism on the stock. In February 2018, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 20%. We note that apart from SkyWest, transportation stocks like Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year.Earnings Estimates on an UpswingUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism about a stock’s prospects. SkyWest scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and yearly earnings being revised 5.1% and 14.3% upward, respectively, over the last 90 days.Style ScoreAdditionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to note that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1507,ALK,"The robust U.S. job data for February bodes well for the domestic economy. In fact, American businesses have recorded the strongest jobs growth in a year and a half in February. Factors like warmer-than-normal weather conditions and Trump’s business-friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive numbers.While the economy is currently basking in the glory of the February job data, it is worth noting that market participants were gripped by fears of inflation only a month back. Notably, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 had entered into the correction territory on Feb 9. In fact, the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) highlighted the heightened volatility in the market at that time.Given the fluctuating nature of the U.S. equity market, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends seem to be a prudent strategy right now. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Airlines: A Sector to ConsiderA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having airline stocks. Infact, airlines have rebounded nicely after having laid low by hurricanes last year. Markedly, the financial prosperity of airline stocks has contributed to their shareholder-friendly attitude. This is well-reflected by its healthy price performance over the last six months. The Zacks Airline industry has gained 13.7% in the period, outperforming the S&P 500’s 11.9% rally.Factors like healthy demand for air travel and improving unit scenario have contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding airlines. The Zacks Industry Rank of 97 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of airlines. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 38% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankMoreover, the fact that Warren Buffett — one of the most revered investors of all time — continues to show his affinity for airline stocks bodes well for the sector. Last month, the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" in an interview to CNBC, did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thus showcasing his interest in the space.More Dividend Hikes Likely Under the New Tax LawThe new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for airline stocks. This is because it is likely to boost cash flow and in turn improve the bottom line of carriers. Moreover, the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) declared bonuses ($1,000 per member), following the tax overhaul, highlights the optimism on stocks pertaining to this measure.Meanwhile, the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Notably, huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio — which is often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.9, which compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 12.2. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Dividend Paying Airlines Should Grace Your PortfolioIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the airline space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Given the significant reduction in taxes, we expect the already cheap airline stocks to fly higher, going ahead. Consequently, we have zeroed in on three stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Moreover, each of the selected stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States as well as internationally. The company, based in Atlanta, GA, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.The company has a dividend yield of 2.18%. Also, Delta has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends since 2013. Notably, it has hiked dividend pay-outs significantly for four consecutive years since then. The latest hike was announced in May 2017, when the company’s board of directors approved a 50.6% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 30.5 cents per share. We expect the company to raise its dividend this year too.American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, is another established name in the airline space paying regular dividends. This Zacks Rank #2 legacy carrier has a Value Score of A. The company has a dividend yield of 0.71%.International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (ICAGY  -  Free Report) based in Madrid, Spain, was founded in 2010. The carrier has a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a dividend yield of 2.48%.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1508,ALK,"It is a well-documented fact that woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued stocks in the airline space for quite some time. In this context, we note that United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) shares had declined significantly in January 2018, even after reporting better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter due to its commentary related to capacity expansion.United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In such a scenario, investors fear that capacity expansion might lead to oversupply in the market even as oil prices are well below the highs touched in 2014. Low ticket prices in the United States also hint at the capacity overexpansion issue. While low air fares attract fliers, it dents profits for carriers.February Traffic Reports Offer a Glimmer of HopeDespite the above-mentioned headwinds, February traffic reports of most carriers seem to be encouraging, thus hinting at a decline in capacity-related woes in the airline space. This is because load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) has decreased at each of the above-mentioned carriers as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion in the month.At Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), load factor improved 40 basis points year over year to 81.5% in February, with traffic increasing 3.8% and capacity expanding 3.4%. Higher traffic growth in the same month also led to 200 basis points, 340 basis points, 140 basis points and 190 basis points increase in load factor at Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report), United Continental and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines, respectively.In fact, Southwest’s load factor expansion to 81% is a record figure for February.Price Performance in FebruaryIn view of the favorable load factor readings, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry outperformed the broader market in February. While the S&P 500 Index gained 3.7%, the industry rallied 4.8%.The impressive February traffic reports are likely to keep the long-standing capacity-related fears at bay, at least for now. Let’s take a look at some of the other factors which highlight the attractiveness of the sector.Impressive Unit Revenue Projections For the first quarter of 2018, unit revenue views are impressive, highlighting the solid demand for air travel. For example, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) growth between 2% and 4%. Meanwhile, United Continental envisions consolidated passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2% year over year.Delta anticipates total unit revenues (excluding refinery sales) to increase in the band of 2.5-4.5% (on a year-over-year basis) for the current quarter. In fact, the company expects to perform well on this front throughout 2018, with passenger unit revenue growth estimated in each quarter.Dividends/Buybacks Bode WellThe likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).Notably, huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly. See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

1509,ALK,"In the last five trading days, pilots at Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) ratified the tentative five-year contract pertaining to a pay raise. As costs are likely to increase following the ratification, the low-cost carrier revised its current-quarter and year projections.On the traffic front, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines — reported impressive numbers for February. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) increased at both carriers as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. Additionally, Hawaiian Airlines was in the news owing its fleet modernization efforts.Alaska Air Group Inc.’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — also hit the headlines by virtue of its codeshare agreement with Fiji Airways — Fiji's national carrier. Furthermore, due to winter storm, U.S. carriers had to cancel multiple flights during the week, which might hurt revenues in the current quarter.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Feb 28, 2018). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 14.69 billion, up 3.8% year over year.

During the week, they reportedly passed a tax bill that excluded jet fuel tax exemption. Inclusion of the said provision, would have boosted the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) carrier through significant savings per year.

Following the ratification, wages of pilots increase by an average of 43% apart from other benefits. Subsequently, the carrier revised its current-quarter and year projections with respect to certain metrics. For example, cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, is expected to decline 3% in the quarter compared with the prior projection of 5.5-6.5% (Read more: Spirit Airlines Revises View Post Pilot Contract Ratification).3. Airline operations were severely disrupted for a couple of days from Mar 2, 2018 due to the deadly nor’easter in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast of United States. Notably, this winter storm impeded travel plans and caused harassments to passengers. It caused heavy snowfall accompanied by hurricane-force winds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in the affected areas (Read more: Nor'easter Cripples Airline Operations: What Lies Ahead?).4 Alaska Airlines entered into a bilateral codeshare agreement with Fiji Airways.  Per the deal, Fiji Airways can place its ""FJ"" code on Alaska Airlines operated flights from San Francisco to two popular destinations in the United States — Seattle and Portland. Additionally, the contract provides extended and seamless connectivity between flights of the two carriers. In fact, by inking this deal, Alaska Airlines and Fiji Airways have expanded their partnership (Read more: Alaska Air Group Arm to Share Codes With Fiji Airways).5. In a bid to upgrade its fleet, Hawaiian Airlines executed a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for buying 10 Boeing Dreamliners.  The first of the fuel-efficient, lightweight Boeing 787-9 aircraft is expected to join its fleet in the first quarter of 2021.  Moreover, Hawaiian Airlines has options to purchase 10 more such planes.On a separate issue, February load factor at Hawaiian Airlines increased 190 basis points to 84.8% as traffic growth (7.4%) outpaced capacity expansion (4.9%) in the month. PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, though the losses were muted in nature.

1510,ALK,"Airline operations have been disrupted severely over the last couple of days due to the deadly nor’easter in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast of United States. Notably, this winter storm has impeded travel plans and caused harassments to passengers. It caused heavy snowfall accompanied by hurricane-force winds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in the affected areas.Flight Cancellations at Large Due to the StormWith the storm disrupting normal life, it is of little wonder that travel plans were thrown haywire as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights. In fact, the severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that approximately 4000 flights were cancelled in the United States by various carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) since Mar 2, 2018.While Delta and United Continental carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), American Airlines has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The worst scenario was on Friday with carriers in the United States cancelling 3,423 flights while more than 4,000 were delayed. In fact, operations were disrupted severely at hubs like Boston, New York and Philadelphia.More Worries Loom Ahead?Although the winds have weakened, storm-related harassments still linger, thousands of homes in eastern United States are still without power. According to a Reuters report, coastal areas of Maine, MA, among others might still be affected by floods and extreme high tides.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including American Airlines, Delta and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) are offering various facilities. For example, they can opt for change of flights without incurring any extra cost.Some Similar Incidents Weather-related issues have hurt airlines previously as well. In January 2018, operations at carriers were disrupted by winter storm Grayson. Last year, back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) dented airline operations significantly.Also, winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines, causing extensive damage. In fact, such acts of nature hinder the schedules of carriers, thus causing multiple flight cancellations. Other Factors Hurting Airlines Apart from the storm-related disruption in operations, airlines have been confronted with a few other challenges.Of late, the disagreement between legacy carriers — American Airlines and United Continental — pertaining to gate allocation at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport has been grabbing headlines. Both carriers, having major hubs at Chicago’s largest airport, are levelling charges against each other. Unless resolved quickly, this issue might snowball into a major crisis.Moreover, fears related to capacity overexpansion were re-ignited with January traffic reports of most carriers like Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), exhibiting a fall in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers). The downturn can be attributed to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.We remind investors that shares of United Continental declined significantly in January, even after reporting better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter on issues related to capacity.On the fourth-quarter conference call, the company stated that it will continue expanding capacity in a bid to maintain market share at major airport hubs to deal with competition from discount carriers like Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report). For 2018, United Continental’s capacity growth is projected between 4% and 6% year over year. The metric is anticipated to increase in 2019 as well as 2020.Furthermore, airfares have declined for three successive months in the United States. Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares seem to be favorable for fliers, it becomes a drag on the company’s top line with their profits being hurt.In addition to the above challenges, the rise in fuel costs also does not bode well for carriers. Evidently, fourth-quarter earnings declined at the likes of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) on high fuel costs.Price PerformanceIn view of the above headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The S&P 500 Index has gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 10%. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1513,ALK,"Shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have lost 33.6% in a year, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 9.6%.  Reasons Behind the Price PlungeHigh labor and fuel costs have been hurting the company’s bottom line for quite some time. Notably, the company’s earnings declined 46.8% in the fourth quarter due to steep costs. Moreover, the carrier expects first-quarter 2018 cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items to rise approximately 6% year over year. While the metric for 2018 is predicted to increase around 2.5%. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to grow 21% in the first quarter of 2018.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) also decreased 5.1% year over year. Consequently, such below-par performance of the key metric does not bode well for the company.The company has also been struggling with capacity overexpansion woes. In January, the company reported disappointing traffic results with load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) contracting 230 basis points in the month. This was because of capacity expansion (6.6%) exceeding traffic growth (3.5%).The pessimism surrounding the company is further evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.4% downward in the last 30 days. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D also highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Additionally, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) supports our negative stance regarding the stock.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Airfares declined in the month, marking the third consecutive month of a drop in ticket prices.Even though, the low air fares are encouraging for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.

The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 1.6% compared with the year-over-year decline of 13.9% in preceding quarter.Will Airlines Fly High in Q4?Given that the airline stocks form an integral part of the transportation sector, it is needless to say that companies in this space share the buoyant picture of the broader sector. Notably, the better-than-expected results reported by the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) in Q4 highlight the air of optimism surrounding airlines.The improved unit revenue scenario bodes well for airline stocks as they seem to be back in favor post hurricanes. Evidently, the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) have issued improved Q4 projections with respect to the metric, which measures sales relative to capacity for a carrier.The favorable scenario supports the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 87 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry.

1526,ALK,"As soon as the tax reform got into effect, a flurry of wage hikes and bonus payments started showing up. The tax bill cuts “the corporate rate from 35% to 21%, gives pass-through businesses like the Trump Organization a 20% tax deduction, raises the standard deduction, expands the child tax credit, and temporarily lowers individual rates across the board (read: Tax Bill: What ETF Investors Need to Know).”The Trump administration is also proposing a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system, allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes. This will result in extra cash, which may prove beneficial for shareholder-value maximization.Per a Tax Policy Center analysis, the bill will lower taxes for Americans in all income groups in 2018, but increase after-tax income by an average of 2.2%. However, the tax cut for individuals will gradually decrease over time and close completely in 2025.For individuals, the final version keeps the seven tax brackets intact but lowers the rates for most others. The new tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% compared with the current structure of 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%. The framework offers tax relief to middle-class families by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly (read: ETFs to Bet on the Final Tax Bill: What Hot, What's Not).Impact on Consumers Since corporates will be benefiting from steep cuts, an increasing number of companies are paying one-time cash bonuses. Many employers are boosting wages. And a certain group of companies say that they will raise matching contributions to workers' 401(k) plans.Walmart announced recently that it plans to hike the starting pay for hourly workers to $11 and pay up to $1,000 in a one-time cash bonus to suitable associates based on seniority. As per an article published on usatoday.com, many reputed U.S. companies including AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report), American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) have announced bonuses.The source went on to explain that BB&T also increased the minimum hourly pay rate from $12 to $15, effective Jan 1, 2018. Fifth Third Bank hiked the minimum wage to $15 per hour for all employees while PNC Financial will raise the minimum pay rate to $15 an hour by the end of 2018.Added to this, companies like Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Aflac Inc (AFL  -  Free Report) have announced that they are taking steps to help employees save for retirement. These companies are “boosting matching contributions to employees' 401(k) retirement plans.”Consumer ETFs in FocusThe dual effect of wage hike and tax cuts should translate into higher disposable income for consumers. As a result, consumer ETFs should be investors’ top focus. iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report), First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (FXD  -  Free Report), and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio (PSCD  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks ETF Rank #2, should thus be great picks (read: E-Commerce Face-Off: Wal-Mart Vs.

1527,ALK,"Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) has recently reported traffic figures for December 2017. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 9.2% to 4.51 billion. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) rose 10.3% to 5.48 billion. However, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers declined 80 basis points to 82.3% in the month as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth.At the end of 2017, Alaska Air Group generated RPMs of 52.34 billion (up 7.3% year over year) and ASMs of 57.95 billion (up 7.1% year over year). While, load factor stood at 84.3% compared with 84.1% in 2016.We remind investors that last month, the carrier hiked its guidance for non-fuel unit costs in the fourth quarter mainly due to pay-related deal inked with its pilots. Fourth-quarter cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items is anticipated between 8.63 cents and 8.68 cents, higher than the previous view of 8.50-8.55 cents range.High costs are likely to hurt the airline's bottom line in the fourth quarter of 2017 as was in the third quarter.

1528,ALK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Alaska Air Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Alaska Air Group’s current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint (which is 12.8) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Alaska Air Group has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10.9, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Alaska Air Group has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Alaska Air Group currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ALK a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Alaska Air Group might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives ALK a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full-year 2017 estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 12% in the past two months, while the full-year 2017 estimate has fallen about 1.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Alaska Air Group, Inc. QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAlaska Air Group is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 28% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1529,ALK,"There were quite a few updates in the airline space over the past week with key players like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) unveiling their respective traffic numbers for December 2017. More than the traffic reports, focus was on the projections for the fourth quarter.While Delta increased its guidance for non-fuel unit costs mainly owing to the power outage at the Atlanta airport, United Continental provided an improved outlook for passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM:  a key measure of unit revenue). In fact, stronger yields and better close-in demand contributed to United Continental’s improved outlook. Delta will kick off the fourth-quarter earnings  season for the airline space on Jan 11.On the non-traffic front, airlines were laid low by another winter storm — Grayson. As a result, the key airline players like United Continental and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) had to cancel multiple flights.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jan 3, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. At Delta, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 16.73 billion, down 0.4% year over year.

1531,ALK,"Stocks in the airline space have been struggling lately due to multiple headwinds like higher fuel costs and the havoc created by Harvey. However, major sector participants breathed a sigh of relief as the impact of Irma was not as severe as forecasted in Florida. In fact, Irma has been downgraded to a tropical depression.Carriers Fly High Led by American AirlinesBuoyed by the weaker-than-expected impact, most airline stocks flew high on Sept. 11 after being grounded lately. Major gainers included the likes of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report).With a high proportion of sector participants trading in the green, it was of little surprise that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index had a field day. The sector tracker ended the trading session at $107.69, up 2% from the closing price on Sep 8. In fact, the rally was not limited to airline stocks as major indices gained handsomely. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% to close the trading session at a record 2,488.11 with American Airlines leading the show. The Dow Jones Industrial average treaded past the 22,000 mark for the first time since mid-August. The Nasdaq Composite Index also closed at 6,432, gaining 1.1%.The surge was mainly owing to the change in course of Irma. Consequently, Miami and Orlando escaped the projected extreme devastation as the storm moved westward. Markedly, American Airlines, which has significant exposure to Florida and operates multiple flights from Charlotte and Miami on a daily basis, was naturally a big benefactor. The stock gained 5.2%, ending the trading session at $45.86.Delta and American Airlines Bullish on Q4In September 2017, many airline stocks including the likes of United Continental and Southwest Airlines had trimmed their respective unit revenue projections for the current quarter with the Harvey-induced revenue loss being the main culprit. The rise in fuel costs, which again may be Harvey-induced, also has not helped matters.However, airline heavyweights — Delta and American Airlines — sounded bullish regarding their prospects in the final quarter of the year.Last week, at the Cowen Global Transportation Conference, American Airlines had declared that it expects to perform better with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the fourth quarter compared with the current quarter.Moreover, the carrier forecasted lower year-over-year growth with respect to another key metric — cost per available seat miles — excluding fuel and other special items. The metric is expected to grow at approximately only 3% in the final quarter compared with the 5% growth projected in the current quarter.Delta also appeared to be optimistic about a rebound in the fourth quarter at the same investor conference, on the back of healthy demand for leisure travel. The bullish commentary of two of the biggest airline players in the United States bodes well for the sector, indicating that all is not lost with a rebound possible from the recent struggles.Both Delta and American Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Industry Rank Holds Out HopeThe Zacks Industry Rank of 87 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the fact that despite the recent struggles, the sector remains an attractive investment option. Notably, the favorable rank places the companies in the top 34% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankValuation Signals More UpsideThe impressive Zacks Industry Rank is well supported by the segment’s attractive valuation. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry doesn’t look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 7.6, which is better than what the industry saw in the last five years. The ratio is almost near the low end of 5.1 during the period.Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 10.9 and the median level is 9.4. The industry’s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly signals more upside as well. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The carrier aims to transport 24.8 million customers from the three London airports — Stansted, Gatwick and Luton (read more: Ryanair Issues 2018 London Summer Roster Amid Brexit Fears).Meanwhile, the carrier also unveiled impressive traffic numbers for August. Traffic climbed 10% and load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 97% on the back of lower air ticket prices.Currently, Ryanair holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Spirit Airlines expects its top line to decline to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to Harvey. This view takes into account the multiple flights cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the natural calamity.In the current quarter, the company anticipates TRASM to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% and 4%). In fact, per the company, 100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast.On a brighter note, the company revised its unit cost (non-fuel) guidance for the current-quarter favorably owing to better operational performance. Spirit Airlines now expects adjusted cost per available seat miles (CASM ex-fuel) to decline between 2% and 3% on a year-over-year basis (the previous guidance had projected the metric in the band of -1% and +1%).3. Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the month. Meanwhile, load factor increased 350 basis points to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like higher fuel costs and soft yields. Delta now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline, however, raised its outlook for fuel prices per gallon from $1.68 to $1.73 from the earlier $1.55 to $1.60 band. The uptick was driven by an increase in market price that began in late July.4.  Alaska Airlines stated that from Sep 27, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs will begin earning miles on the flights. Additionally, the carriers will form a codeshare partnership, subject to government approval. Notably, a codeshare deal allows sharing of flights. This implies that a passenger can avail any flight operated by either of the companies covered under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number (read more: Alaska Air Group Arm-Singapore Airlines Deal to Aid Flyers).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.5%-16.2%UAL-6.7%-16.2%GOL17%37%DAL-3.3%-6.2%JBLU-1.3%-5.6%AAL-3.5%-3.1%SAVE-13.1%-39.4%LUV-0.2%-10%CPA6.5%22.5%ALK-2.2%-22.4%                  The table above shows that all airline stocks barring GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings traded in the red in the past week mainly due to the bearish events mentioned above.

1535,ALK,"Airline companies have been undergoing turmoil of late due to the recent extensive devastation caused by hurricane Harvey. It’s small wonder that the natural calamity has impeded travel globally, disrupting the airline operations. In fact, Harvey led to multiple flight cancellations. Further adding to the woes, airline stocks have been struck by an additional headwind.Reasons Behind The Stocks’ PlungeShares of major airline companies declined following Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s (DAL  -  Free Report) traffic report for August. Also, theNYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 1.4% at the close of business on Sep 5. Delta’s shares have dipped 3.5%, while shares of its peers namely, American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have sunk substantially.Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the ongoing month. On the other hand, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers, increased 350 basis points to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like tougher competition and higher fuel costs. Surprisingly, it made no claims on either Hurricane Irma or Harvey having a bearing on the current scenario.The carrier now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline however, raised its outlook for fuel prices to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket on the back of upsurge in market price which began in late July.Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) too trimmed its view for revenue per available seat mile. The carrier estimates the metric to reduce to 7-8.5% in the third quarter of 2017. Prior guidance had anticipated a drop of 2-4%. The below-par guidance was mainly due to disruptions induced by Harvey.Other Headwinds On another warning note, airline companies feel skeptical about Hurricane Irma, that has already resulted in multiple flights to Caribbean cities being cancelled. The impact of the latest natural calamity on airline stocks is likely to increase further in the coming days .The decision of Warren Buffett, one of the most revered investors of all times, to cut his stakes from three airline heavyweights — Delta, United Continental and American Airlines — also points at the cloud of uncertainty looming over this key sector.Apart from recent challenges, high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters. With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that expenses on this front are escalating, limiting bottom-line growth.Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry fared poorly due to the headwinds, thereby significantly underperforming the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index nudged up 1.5% as against the industry’s decline of 6.5%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1536,ALK,"We issued an updated research report on key airline player, Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), on Aug 29.Notably, the company’s product portfolio has broadened significantly following the acquisition of Virgin America, last year. In fact, the company has become a major player along the West Coast following the buyout. Also, its top line has been boosted by the strong growth in passenger revenues.Alaska Air Group’s performance with respect to passenger unit revenues is also encouraging. Moreover, the carrier's July traffic report was impressive, on the back of strong demand for air travel. The company's efforts to reward shareholders too raise optimism in the stock.However, high labor costs continue to hurt the company. In May, pilots of Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, approved an amendment to the existing eight year pay-related contract. This will increase labor costs further as pilots' compensation has shot up following the amendment. Consequently, this Seattle, WA-based company’s bottom line is expected to remain under pressure, going forward.With labor deals in vogue in the airline space, high labor costs are not unique to Alaska Air Group. Other players in the space like Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) too have inked deals with various labor groups over the last few months.Moreover, though positive on Alaska Air Group’s Virgin America buyout, we note that the transaction, like any merger, has integration risks attached to it. Merger-related costs are also limiting bottom-line growth at Alaska Air Group.Consequently, shares of Alaska Air Group have underperformed the industry it belongs to, so far this year. The company’s shares have declined 15.3% year to date, as against the industry rally of 6.6%. In view of the above commentary, we would advise investors to wait for a better entry point before accumulating shares. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carried by Alaska Air Group seems to suggest the same.Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the airline space may consider SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1538,ALK,"There were quite a few developments in the airline industry that grabbed headlines last week. However, the havoc wreaked by Tropical Storm Harvey in Houston, overshadowed everything as operations of key airline participants like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — as it relies extensively on its hub at Houston — were adversely impacted.The Harvey havoc apart, major U.S.-based carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) were laid low following the announcement of Iceland-based low-cost carrier WOW Air to expand into four U.S. destinations — all in the Midwest.On a cheerful note, low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co.

Following the expansion, the total number of U.S. cities served by the carrier will increase to 12 (read more: Airline Stocks Sink as WOW Air Expands into the Midwest).2.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second Quarter Earnings Alaska Air Group performed well in the second quarter of 2017. The carrier’s earnings of $2.51 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the bottom line expanded 18.4% on a year-over-year basis.

In fact, passenger revenues that improved 43% on a year-over-year basis, accounted for bulk of the top line (86%).Operating StatisticsAirline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, rose 44.2% year over year to 13,554 million in the reported quarter.

1541,ALK,"Normal life has been disrupted with the tropical storm Harvey wreaking havoc, and is expected to cause further damage. In fact, the storm caused severe devastation throughout the weekend with Houston – the fourth largest city in the country -- experiencing the worst hit.Meanwhile, the city has been witnessing unprecedented rainfall, resulting in multiple causalities. Also, the flooding is expected to continue as Texas is battered by heavy rains due to the storm.Notably, Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm from a category-four hurricane, is expected to remain over Texas until mid-week.Flight Cancellations at Large Due to HarveyIn view of the extensive damage, it is of little wonder the natural calamity impeded travel disrupting operations of airlines. In fact, Harvey resulted in significant travel disruptions over the weekend leading to multiple flight cancellations/delays at the George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby airports, resulting in untold miseries and harassments to passengers.According to a Bloomberg report, operations at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) were significantly crippled due to the natural calamity as it relies extensively on its hub at Houston, causing it to cancel a huge number of flights therein to ensure the security of its passengers. Currently, United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) had to trim Houston operations. According to The Wall Street Journal, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) had to cancel 110 flights on Aug 27 due to the calamity, majority of them to and from Houston.Moreover, in a bid to mitigate the harassments of passengers, most carriers including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) have made offers to passengers who are rescheduling their travel dates. These passengers will be able to do so without paying any additional charges. Markedly, with the two Houston airports - George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport - closed as heavy rainfall continues to hit Houston, air travel is expected to be hurt further this week.Evidently, weather-related issues have hurt airlines previously too. In March 2017,operations at carriers were disrupted big time by winter storm Stella. Moreover, this January, an icy winter storm ravaged the Southeast U.S. cities. It also disrupted the flight schedules of airlines, thereby causing undue harassment. Last year, Hurricane Matthew had also caused extensive damage in the affected areas.In fact, such acts of nature throw the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.Other Headwinds Hurting Airlines LatelyApart from the Harvey-related disruption in operations, airlines have been laid low lately by quite a few other happenings.The twin terror attacks in Spain, earlier in the month that claimed multiple lives apart from injuring many, caused travel-focused stocks include airline players to lose value. Such acts of terrorism might cause travel demand to dwindle due to security fears. Naturally, airline stocks are hurt by this anticipation.Moreover, fears related to capacity overexpansion were re-ignited with July traffic reports of most carriers exhibiting a fall in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers). The downturn was due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares are favorable for fliers, it is a drag on the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt.Also, the decision of Warren Buffett, one of the most revered investors of all time, to trim his stakes in three airline heavyweights – Delta, United Continental and American Airlines – also points at the fact that all is not well with this key sector.Price PerformanceIn view of the above recent headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks industry fared worse than the broader market in the last one month. The S&P 500 Index contracted 0.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%.High Labor Costs Remain a DragIn addition to the recent challenges, high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters. With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing, which is limiting bottom-line growth.The situation on this front is not expected to improve in the third quarter as well. Delta expects non-fuel unit cost (including profit sharing) to increase approximately 4%. Additionally, consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 5% at American Airlines. Again, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) expects cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, to increase in the band of 16-18%.Bottom LineWith airline companies already grappling with multiple headwinds, the emergence of Harvey has only added to the woes of stocks in the space. Consequently, investors are expected to remain glued to the updates, as stocks strive to return to their winning waysMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1542,ALK,"Millions of Americans flocked to high-visibility locations on Aug 21 to catch a glimpse of the first solar eclipse in 99 years to cross the entire U.S. continent.Stock markets have historically gained momentum after such solar eclipses. Such a once-in-a-lifetime event provides great business opportunity to travel and leisure companies. This calls for investing in solid stocks from such areas.Stocks Rally on Solar EclipseLPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated that “history has shown us that since 1900, any time a total solar eclipse has been seen in the U.S., equity prices have gone up”. According to him, one year after the last 15 other total solar eclipses visible in the U.S., equity prices have gained an average of 17.2%. Stocks have, in fact, gained a whopping 39.6% after the eclipse in June 1954, while the markets rallied nearly 32% after one eclipse in June 1918.Detrick also figured out that the broader markets tend to rise an average 0.9% in the month following an eclipse, while it climbs 7.2% over the next six months. On a lighter note, he added that “it appears our biggest worry isn’t what stocks might do, but whether those glasses we bought online are officially approved by NASA!”Of course, there are other drivers that correspond with the solar calendar including robust quarterly earnings and economic conditions gaining traction at a steady pace.

CEO and COO Larry D. De Shon of car rental company, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) said that eclipse helped push rental prices higher. Maven, the on-demand car sharing brand from General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), had offered a $10 discount code ECLIPSE for travelers to move towards the eclipse lookout point.  And with millions of Americans hitting the road to catch a glimpse of the once-in-a-century solar eclipse, such a move will surely lift the company’s margins.Financial and bank holding company, First Interstate Bancsystem Inc (FIBK  -  Free Report) has more than 120 offices in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Wyoming and Washington. These are some of the key states that experienced the total solar eclipse and with millions flocking to these states, the bank’s business will surely get a shot in the arm.Many brands also geared up to cash in on this rare event. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL aptly named its cruise Total Eclipse, where Bonnie Tyler sang “Total Eclipse of the Heart”. And for those who haven’t traveled, Discovery Communications Inc’s DISCA Science Channel gave live eclipse coverage all through the day.Solar Eclipse a Bonanza for Airlines, HotelsAirlines have largely benefitted from this once in a lifetime event, as many traveled to large parts of the country that are typically rural regions and don’t see much tourist traffic. In fact, Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report) organized for invitation-only flights for “astronomy enthusiasts” who wanted a sighting of the eclipse in the skies. Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also earmarked certain flights that helped travelers view the eclipse from high above the clouds.CNBC’s Eric Chemi noted that hotel bookings in some parts of the country, which were mostly along the eclipse path, skyrocketed 400%. Representatives from online marketplace and hospitality service, Airbnb declared that the site logged more than 40,000 guest bookings as of Jul 31.Many hotel chains like Marriott International Inc (MAR  -  Free Report) offered packages to commuters who head to cities in the path of the eclipse. The company reported that the number of rooms booked in 16 locations was up 60% from last year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT  -  Free Report) is another firm that tried to entice customers with special offers, while InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), another large hotel chain, said last month that two of its three Nashville, Tennessee, hotels were sold out.Top 5 WinnersWith solar eclipse primarily being a boon for airlines, cruises and hotel industries, investing in fundamentally sound stocks from such areas seems prudent.

1543,ALK,"In a bid to expand further, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) announced that it intends to launch flights from Everett‘s Paine Field airport starting from the fall of next year. Through this customer friendly move, the Chicago- based carrier aims to operate six daily flights from the airport to its Denver and San Francisco hubs.The carrier aims to connect more than 120 destinations to these two cities through the new service. The new flights, on resumption, are expected to be warmly welcomed by the concerned passengers as it broadens their travel option. In fact, these flights will be in addition to the 36 it already operates connecting the Seattle-Tacoma International airport and its hubs in the country.Moreover, the increased traffic as a result of the new service should augment the top line of the company. In fact, we note that United Continental's decision to launch flights from Paine Field marks a return of the carrier to the Snohomish County airport as it had operated the first commercial flight from the airport in 1939.In fact, United Continental is not the only U.S.-based carrier to eye the Snohomish County airport. In May this year, the Seattle, WA- based Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) had announced that it intends to start commercial operations to Paine Field next year.Apart from these expansion initiatives, United Continental was also in the news when it reported its July traffic numbers. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion in the month.Notably, United Continental is not the only carrier whose load factor fell in July. This key metric also declined in the month for other airline players like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report).Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1545,ALK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Alaska Air has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.45, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.09. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Alaska Air’ current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 12.82) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.59. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Alaska Air has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.65, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Alaska Air stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Alaska Air has a P/S ratio of about 1.50. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.24 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Alaska Air currently has a Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ALK a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Alaska Air is just 0.90, a level that is somewhat lower than the industry average of 1.43. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, ALK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Alaska Air might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘B’ and a Momentum score of ‘D’. This gives ALK a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and five lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Alaska Air Group, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAlaska Air is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, despite a formidable industry rank (top 8% out of more than 250 industries), a Zacks Rank #3, makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 5.9% to 5.14 billion.Load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers decreased 70 basis points (bps) to 87.1% in the month as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth.

1547,ALK,"Airline operations were severely disrupted on Jan 4 as Winter Storm Grayson wreaked havoc. The storm has battered the East Coast, causing heavy snowfall accompanied by wind gusts in excess of 50 mph in the affected areas.Flight Cancellations MountWith the storm disrupting normal life, it is of little wonder that travel plans were thrown haywire as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights. The severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that the U.S. carriers cancelled more than 4,000 flights, yesterday. Cancellations on Thursday hit operations severely at major airports in Boston, Newark and the New York City.We note that operations at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — the parent company of United Airlines — were hit the hardest among legacy carriers as Newark is a major hub for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. This Chicago-based carrier had to call off more than 560 flights on Jan 4 due to the Grayson-induced disruptions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other airline players like American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) were not spared of the miseries either and had to call of multiple flights resulting in significant loss of revenues.Apart from the cancellations, many flights were delayed causing harassments to passengers. In fact, operations were temporarily suspended at New York's Kennedy International airport due to the recent natural calamity. With high costs (labor plus fuel) impeding bottom-line growth of carriers, multiple flight cancellations caused by Grayson has hurt their top lines. Woes to ContinueWhat is worse is that the woes are likely to continue for the next few days as well, resulting in more flight cancellations and revenue losses for airline operators. In fact, more than 1,000 flights into/out of the United States are expected to be cancelled today.In fact, icy cold wind is expected to blow over the weekend in the affected areas confining people to their homes and disrupting travel plans. Apart from the damaging winds, severe power outages are anticipated in some areas along the East Coast.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including United Continental, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) are offering travel waivers for the concerned passengers. Natural Calamities Hurt Airlines SignificantlyThis is not the first time that the sector participants have been laid low by a winter storm. Earlier, such acts of nature have thrown the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) dented airline operations significantly, hurting results in the third quarter of 2017. Prior to that, winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines, causing extensive damage. Will Grayson Dampen Airlines Recovery?The emergence of Grayson comes at a time when things are looking up for airline stocks after being laid low for most part of 2017. Moreover, the new tax law is expected to be a godsend for airlines.The bullish scenario is reflected in the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last three months. The industry has rallied 8.7% compared with the S&P 500’s 6.8% gain in the same period.Given this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether winter storm Grayson hurts revenues significantly and spoils the results of the affected carriers in the first quarter of 2018. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1548,ALK,"The New Year brought favorable tidings to the employees of airline heavyweights, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), as the carriers announced bonuses worth $1,000 per member, following the tax overhaul. Notably, the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report), also grabbed headlines when it released impressive traffic data for December, 2017. The carrier is benefitting from low air fares and expects it to be even lower in the current year.Meanwhile, issues related to passengers continued to haunt U.S. carriers. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), was the latest sufferer in this regard when it was reportedly sued by the family of an elderly lady. The lady died last year following a fall in an escalator at the Portland Airport, Oregon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 27, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair reported a 3% year over year rise in traffic to 9.3 million for December owing to cheap ticket prices. Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 95% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion in the same month. In fact, low air fares helped the carrier record a 10% rise in 2017 traffic to 129 million.2. The tax overhaul is expected to aid airlines significantly. Buoyed by the new tax laws, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines declared bonuses for their respective employees. American Airlines will pay the amount (totaling $130 million) to each of its employee, excluding officers, by Mar 31, 2018. Meanwhile, Southwest will distribute the cash bonus on Jan 8.Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that the new laws allow companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for airlines as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditure considerably. As a result, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. In this regard, Southwest announced that it will invest significantly toward fleet modernization. In fact, this low-cost carrier converted options on 40 Boeing Max 8s to firm orders. The company also deferred orders for 23 737 Max 7 planes of Boeing until 2023/2024.Following the tax overhaul, Southwest expects to record a non-cash credit in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated in the band of $2-$2.15 in the same quarter.3. The family of a 75- year old lady, reportedly sued Alaska Airlines and the concerned wheelchair contractor following her death after being injured. Apparently, she arrived in Portland after holidaying in Maui. At the airport, she slipped down an escalator. The family has lodged a complaint pertaining to wrongful death against the concerned parties. Currently, Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

1549,ALK,"Last week was relatively quiet for the airline industry. The week, which had a day less of trading owing to Christmas, saw low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) continue with its efforts toward expanding internationally as it announced its intentions of adding a couple of routes from South Florida. European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) was also in news as it faced a pilots’ strike due to issues related to pay and work conditions.Additionally, Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation, has upgraded the ratings of Latin American carrier Gol Linhas’ (GOL  -  Free Report) debt, which includes the corporate family rating to B2 from Caa3. The firm upgraded GOL’s ratings as a result of its strong operating performance on the back of an improving Brazilian economy. According to a Reuters report, passengers in a plane operated by JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) escaped unhurt after the plane skidded off a taxiway in Boston after landing.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnOn the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained almost 1% to $118.04 over the past week.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 20, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Spirit Airlines announced the addition of two new international destinations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The Miramar, Florida-based carrier will begin a daily non-stop service to the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador from Mar 22, 2018 onward. Besides, it will initiate a nonstop service to the Cap-Haïtien International Airport, starting Apr 12, 2018. This will complement the carrier’s existing service to Port-au-Prince (Read more: Spirit Airlines to Add Two Global Routes From South Florida).Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Ryanair, which has been witnessing labor strife for quite some time now, saw its pilots resort to a four-hour strike. This was reportedly the first time its pilots went on strike.  Operations were not disrupted significantly as a result of the pilots’ action. Flights got delayed but not a single one was cancelled. Disruptions were limited to the token strike, after the Irish carrier averted the possibility of a series of strikes across Europe, after agreeing to recognize unions.  3. GOL Linhas, which has had an impressive 2017, received a further shot in the arm when Moody's issued an upgraded rating. The outlook was changed to stable. Capacity discipline, cost-cutting initiatives apart from a strong demand for air travel to Latin America have aided the company this year. Moody's believes that GOL will perform impressively next year too, driven by the tailwinds.4. Inclement weather has been disrupting operations of U.S. carriers of late. Extensive snowfall in Boston resulted in delays as the departure/arrival of flights at Boston’s Logan Airport were halted on Christmas Day for about an hour due to snow-induced reduced visibility. Amid this scenario, a JetBlue Airways plane (AirBus A320) skidded off a snow-filled taxiway at the airport. Thankfully the mishap, which occurred on Dec 25 night, did not result in any injuries.5. In a customer-friendly move, Delta Vacations, the official vacation provider at Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), added six new destinations across the United States to its portfolio. The destinations are Asheville, N.C.; Aspen, Colo.; Panama City, Fla.; Oakland, Calif.; Lexington, Ky.; and Fairbanks, Alaska. Passengers can avail of a wide range of accommodations such as boutique hotels, country inns and beach resorts at each destination.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.   The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week primarily due to the optimism surrounding the tax overhaul, which is expected to aid airlines significantly.

1551,ALK,"Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) has been plagued by numerous headwinds of late. Shares of the company have gained 0.8% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s increase of 11%.  Reasons Behind the UnderperformanceHigh fuel and labor costs have been limiting the carrier’s bottom-line growth for quite some time now and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different. Evidently, the company has raised its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as full-year non-fuel unit costs, mainly on a pay-related deal inked with its pilots.The airline anticipates fourth-quarter cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items between 8.63 cents and 8.68 cents, higher than the previous view of 8.50 cents-8.55 cents. Economic fuel cost for the same period remains unchanged at $2 per gallon.For 2017, CASM excluding fuel and special items is predicted between 8.22 cents and 8.24 cents. Earlier forecast was in the range of 8.19-8.21 cents. The estimate for 2017 economic fuel cost per gallon stands at $1.83, an increase from the prior expectation of $1.82.Moreover, expenses related to the acquisition of Virgin America have potential to hurt the bottom line going forward.Additionally, the carrier’s operations have been severely affected by back-to-back natural calamities. Notably, its Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) decreased 4.2% year over year to 11.29 cents in the third quarter. A persistently below-par performance of this key metric is likely to dent the stock’s performance significantly.Estimate RevisionsThe negative sentiment surrounding the stock is evident from its southbound estimates. For the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 3.1% downward in the last 30 days. Moreover, for full year, the consensus mark has been revised 8.3% downward in the last 60 days.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreIn view of the above negatives, we believe investors would do better to discard Alaska Air Group stock from their portfolio for now. The carrier’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) also supports our view, indicating that the stock is likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of F highlights its dull prospects over the short term.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the airline space may consider Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A.

1553,ALK,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Friday following optimism that the much awaited Republican tax Bill has now garnered sufficient support from policymakers to enable it to be passed next week. These developments are expected to reduce U.S. corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, which in turn led all the three key U.S. indexes to hit their best levels ever. For the week, both the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their fourth straight week of gains, while the Nasdaq posted its first weekly rise in the last three weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.6%, to close at 24,651.74.

On Nasdaq, a 2.32-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 10.2% to close at 9.42.Corker, Rubio Favor Tax Cut BillFollowing his “no” vote on Dec 14, Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, shifted to a “yes” vote the very next day. Corker said he has “decided to support the tax reform package,” voting of which will be held next week. Corker said that this bill will help ensure growth in domestic businesses.Additionally, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has also decided to support the tax Bill, after child tax credit was expanded. He said ""this bill is far from perfect"" even after the draft legislation doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per dependent child, with its refundable part raised from $1,100 to $1,400.Support from both Corker and Rubio raised optimism that the much awaited Republican tax Bill will be passed by policymakers next week. Optimism surrounding a strong decline in corporate tax rates had a broad-based positive impact on markets.Both the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) increased 1.5%. Additionally, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) rose 1.4% and is expected to gain further in rising tax cut prospects. Some of its key holdings, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) advanced 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Both the Dow components have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This marks the fourth rate hike by Fed in a year’s time. Further, central bank officials reiterated their earlier projection of three possible rate hikes in 2018.According to the latest proposals, the Republican Tax Bill lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% instead of the earlier 20%. Further, the top individual rate would be capped at 37%. Moreover, the new corporate tax slab would be implemented from the next year instead of 2019.

On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) rose 9.3% to 5.22 billion.

Load factor stood at 84.5% compared with 84.2% in the first 11 months of 2017.Q4 & Full-Year Guidance RevisedThe carrier has provided a revised outlook for fourth quarter and full-year 2017. It now expects capacity in the range of 15.87 billion-15.92 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The metric’s prior outlook was in the band of 15.95 billion-16 billion. Fourth-quarter cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items is anticipated between 8.63 cents and 8.68 cents, higher than the previous view of 8.50 cents-8.55 cents, mainly due to costs associated with pay related deal inked with its pilots.

1555,ALK,"Shares of SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $53.90 on Dec 11, before retracing a bit to close the session at $53.85. In fact, the stock has performed very well in the last six months. While SkyWest has rallied 43.6%, the Zacks Airline industry’s gained 1% in the same time frame. Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeSkyWest’s efforts to modernize its fleet and streamline operations are impressive. In sync with this, the company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft.Additionally, this St. George, Utah-based carrier inked aircraft purchase and capacity purchase  deals with Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) wholly-owned subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, in October 2017. Per the agreements, SkyWest’s wholly-owned subsidiary — SkyWest Airlines — will operate15 Embraer E175 SC aircraft (70 seats) and five Embraer E175 aircraft (76 seats) under Delta and Alaska Airlines, respectively.So far this year, the company has also witnessed a decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) due to its fleet transition efforts. The presence of E175 planes in its fleet resulted in approximately 139,200 additional block hours. However, the presence of other types of planes in its fleet resulted in a decline of approximately 232,500 block hours, causing the metric to fall 5.2% year to date.We note that it has been proven historically that an earnings surprise is reflective of the true health of a company. An impressive track record in this respect generally acts as a catalyst behind stock price appreciation. Also, earnings surprise history indicates a company’s consistency in beating market estimates. Generally, investors take into account a company’s upbeat earnings history while deciding to buy a stock. While arriving at this investment decision, they expect that it will continue reporting better-than-expected earnings per share in its next releases.In this context, the carrier’s impressive track record with respect to earnings per share seems to be encouraging.  SkyWest outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 13 quarters. In the third quarter of 2017, this regional carrier performed very impressively reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenues. We expect the carrier to continue performing impressively on the bottom-line front in the near term as well.Moreover, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks raise optimism in the stock.  In February 2017, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 60%. Also, SkyWest’s expansion-related efforts are impressive.The above bullish factors are reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), implying that it is expected to outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Estimate Revisions & Style ScoreUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. SkyWest scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 4.5% upward over the last 90 days. Similarly, the consensus mark for current-year earnings has been revised 2.5% upward in the same time span.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The carrier’s bullish Zacks Rank also supports our view.Stock to ConsiderApart from SkyWest, investors interested in the airline space may also consider Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Shares of Gol Linhas have soared more than 200% in a year. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1556,ALK,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4. The uptick was primarily due to the Senate’s approval of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2.Consequently, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the day 1.8% higher, thereby closing at 10,368.58. The Index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies, apart from the airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U.S. transportation division.With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry gained 3.6% and 2.8% on the day, thereby hitting their respective 52-week highs of $239.05 and $123.02.Other notable gainers from railroads include — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) (up 4.4%) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) (up 1.7%) — and from airlines — Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) (up 3.5%), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 3.1%) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) (up 2.1%).All the above-mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax BillWith the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill, we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary. The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4.Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20%. On materialization, this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States. Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues, domestically. Therefore, the 15-point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn will aid their bottom lines.The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would’ve shelled out. Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies.Capital ExpendituresTransportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Picture for AirlinesApart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.In fact, most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low-cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers. This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago. Consequently, their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses. Naturally, they do not stand to be benefitted immediately (tangibly) by the tax cuts. However, their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now.Price PerformanceFollowing the recovery from the negative effects of the back-to-back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently. Additionally, an  improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last month. While the industry rallied 4.4%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 2% in the same period. With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality, transports are expected to gain further in the coming days. Naturally, investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

On this week’s episode, we dive into the business of Major League Soccer ahead of Saturday’s championship matchup between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC.The MLS has grown in both size and stature in recent years. Just last week, the MLS announced four cities—Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville, and Sacramento—as finalists for two new expansion franchises, with a whopping $150 million price tag attached.On top of that, the league’s TV ratings and attendance numbers have climbed in 2017. Team valuations also continue to rise, as notable owners from the NFL and NBA, such as Robert Kraft and Paul Allen, help inspire other billionaires to get in on the growth of MLS.The league’s TV partners—Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Univision, and others—broadcasted more games than ever before, many in new primetime spots on flagship channels.Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is firmly committed to MLS and growing the sport of soccer in the U.S. The German sportswear giant keeps on pouring money into the league through jersey deals and youth development.MLS is also a corporate sponsors dream, given the ability to advertise directly on team jerseys. This is something Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and many others have embraced. Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also all current MLS partners and sponsors.Still, despite all of these positive signs and real growth, many people around the U.S. question the current and long-term viability of the relatively young MLS.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1559,ALK,"The Thanksgiving holiday period hasn’t been very eventful for the airline space. However, a few developments concerning big names like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) are worth a mention.In line with the efforts to expand its presence, American Airlines announced its intentions to start operating additional flights to Canada. Also, United Continental’s subsidiary — United Airlines — stated that it performed exceeding well in the Thanksgiving travel week, with respect to many key metrics like on-time performance.Meanwhile, the long-standing dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts got uglier with Etihad reportedly voicing concerns over a provision in the Senate’s tax-reform bill. According to the provision, certain foreign carriers including the likes of Etihad would have to pay U.S. corporate tax under certain conditions.We note that major U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines and United Continental had complained to the U.S. administration that the massive subsidies and other benefits enjoyed by the three state-owned carriers — Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates — are unfair as they deny a level playing field to the carriers in the United States.Also, according to the Air Travel Consumer Report released by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), service-related complaints from customers in April 2017 were comparatively more than that in April 2016 and March 2017.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 22, 2017).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnRecap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. On Nov 16, the $1.5-trillion tax-reform bill was passed by the House Republicans by a vote of 227 to 205. This further threatens to ignite the dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts. A provision, introduced by Johnny Isakson — a senator from Delta’s home state Georgia — might hit the pockets of some foreign carriers hard. According to the proposal, some foreign carriers will have to pay U.S. corporate taxes on their income earned in the United States. However, two conditions need to be fulfilled.  These include the absence of a reciprocal tax agreement between the United States and the country where the foreign carrier is based and second, less frequent flights from the United States to the concerned nation (less than two weekly departures/arrivals by U.S. carriers). In the next few days, the tax cut bill will be debated and voted upon by the full Senate.2. In a bid to expand its operations, American Airlines announced that it intends to add flights to Canada from its hub at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, next year. Toward this end, the carrier aims to start operating daily flights to Vancouver from May 4, 2018.Moreover, flights on a seasonal basis to Calgary are expected to be operational from June 7, 2018. American Airlines also intends to increase frequencies from the U.S. East Coast to Eastern Canada apart from extending seasonal service to popular destinations in Canada. American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. It hasn’t been a successful 2017 for United Airlines so far due to various issues like the infamous David Dao incident. But, recently the company has something to cheer for. The carrier performed exceedingly well in the Thanksgiving travel week (Nov 19 to Nov 26) smashing various records. For example, with respect to on-time departures the company established a company record of 89.1% on Thanksgiving Day. The next day United Airlines improved the record with the measure rising to 89.8%.4. According to the June Air Travel Consumer Report released by the DOT, the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 1.6% in April 2017 from 0.9% recorded a year ago. The figure, however, compared favorably to the reading of 1.8% in March 2017.According to the report, 78.5% flights operated by U.S. carriers (mentioned in the report) arrived on time in April 2017. This represents a deterioration from the comparable figures of 84.5% a year ago and 79.9% in March. Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) secured the top spot with 88.8% of its flights arriving on time in April. The carrier was followed by United Continental and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months.  CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA4.4%-21.1%UAL3.4%-25.9%GOL10.9%92.2%DAL1.5%0.4%JBLU0.7%-12.3%AAL3.9%1%SAVE7.5%-27.9%LUV2.7%-7.4%CPA2.6%21.1%ALK1.4%-22.3%              The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week leading to a 1.7% gain in the NYSE ARCA Airline index to $111.72.

1560,ALK,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) has confronted multiple headwinds due to the recent hurricanes and escalating costs like many of its fellow airline operators so far in 2017.Consequently, shares of the company have declined 24.2%, significantly underperforming the Zacks Airline industry’s rally of 15.1% on a year-to-date basis.Lets have a deeper look into the headwinds.Alaska Air Group’s performance with respect to passenger unit revenues is concerning.  This is because passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) decreased 4.2% and total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) declined 6.1% in the third quarter of 2017.Last year, Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America. Though positive on the deal, we note that this transaction has integration risks attached to it. In fact, merger-related costs contributed to the 44% rise in total operating expenses (on a reported basis) in the third quarter of 2017. Labor costs too increased backed by the company’s pay-related deal with its pilots.The increase in fuel costs are also limiting bottom-line growth. For example, fuel price increased 13.9% to $1.80 per gallon in the third quarter.Moreover, Alaska Air Group like its fellow airline operators such as United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) has been hit hard by the back-to-back hurricanes this year. Additionally, Alaska Air Group’s high debt levels raise concerns.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds, we believe that investors should stay away from the stock right now. Alaska Air Group’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also supports our view, indicating that the stock is likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of F highlights its short-term attractiveness.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1562,ALK,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

During the week, Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic numbers for October. While load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased at Copa Holdings, the metric declined at Alaska Air Group as capacity expansion was surpassed by traffic growth at the Seattle, WA based carrier.Furthermore, expansion-related updates from United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group’s subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, also grabbed headlines in the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 15, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1.

Allegiant Air announced that it has reached a tentative agreement with Transport Workers Union (TWU), which represents its 1,150 flight attendants after many years of negotiation. Tentative agreements, however, do not necessarily mean that the deal will be operational. They will be effective only on ratification. In fact, Allegiant and TWU had reached a tentative deal last year as well. However, it was voted down by the flight attendants. Allegiant will be hoping that results of the ratification vote are favorable this time. Results of the ratification vote are anticipated to be out by year end. The deal, if ratified, will result in significant pay raises for the flight attendants.5. In a bid to expand its domestic network, United Continental announced its decision to add flights from five of its hubs in the United States to 10 cities in California, Florida, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. The daily year-round flights, expected to be launched in April 2018, will meet the surge in demand for air travel next spring. The company also intends to start operating daily seasonal flights from the O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Los Angeles (LAX) from June 2018, as part of its expansion drive.

The carrier still expects passenger unit revenue for the third quarter to be down 1% to up 1% on a year-over-year basis. 5. The monthly data released by the IATA revealed a 7.8% year-over-year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for the month of Jun 2017. The rise was attributable to an increase in both international and domestic traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) in the month. The report also revealed a 6.5% rise in capacity (measured in available seat kilometers).The greater increase in traffic compared with capacity resulted in the load factor improving 100 basis points to 81.9% in June. Moreover, traffic grew at the highest pace (7.9%) in 12 years in the first half of the year on the back of an improving economy and subdued air fares. Load factor also touched a record 80.7% in the first half of 2017.6. In a bid to expand further, Alaska Airlines started operating non-stop flights connecting Mexico City to two key U.S. cities —San Francisco and Los Angeles.

In May 2017, the carrier started non-stop flights connecting Philadelphia and Portland, OR to meet the growing demand during summer. The flights have been operating on a daily basis from May 22 and will continue until Aug 26.The company’s traffic results in May and June are also impressive.

Additionally, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers increased 140 basis points (bps) and 100 bps in May and June respectively, owing to an expansion in traffic growth in excess of capacity expansion. However, in May 2017, pilots of Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska approved of an amendment to the existing eight-year pay-related contract.

1579,ALK,"Last week, Latin American carriers — GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) — reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for the third quarter of 2017. This outperformance was attributed to improvement in the Latin American economy. The results were also aided by strong demand for air travel.On the non-earnings front, the major airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) revealed their respective October traffic numbers in the previous week. While load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined at JetBlue and United Continental due to capacity overexpansion, the metric improved at Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines as capacity expansion was outweighed by traffic growth in the same month.Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) decision to end flights to Cuba also invited attraction. On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index was almost flat at $104.98 over the last five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 08, 2017).

Net sales, comprising of cargo and passenger revenues, came in at $858.8 million (R$2.7 billion) surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $783.3 million.The top line expanded 13.2% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong demand for air travel.

Copa Holdings’ third-quarter earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $2.38 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. The bottom line came in ahead of the year-ago figure of $1.30 per share. Quarterly revenues improved 15.6% on a year-over-year basis to $657 million and also topped the consensus mark of $633 million.The year-over-year increase in the top line was primarily due to a 16.5% improvement in passenger revenues.

The carrier will operate its last Los Angeles-Havana flight on Jan 22, 2018. The tweaked Cuba policy announced by President Trump earlier this month might also have played a part in Alaska Air's decision. The new policy prohibits individual travel to the island nation among other things. Meanwhile, the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways have already trimmed their services to the nation. Also, lower-than-expected demand caused the likes of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines to terminate their flights to Cuba. 4. At Spirit Airlines, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 2.1 billion, up 21.6% on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 21.2% to 2.53 billion.Load factor increased to 83.2% from 82.9% recorded in October 2016. The improvement was owing to traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion for the same month (read more: Spirit Airlines' October Traffic and Load Factor Increase). 5. While revealing its October traffic data, United Continental reiterated its fourth quarter guidance for passenger unit revenues. The metric is still expected to decline in the band of 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. The carrier suffered a decline in load factor for the month as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth (read more: United Continental's October Traffic Up, Load Factor Down). 6.

October traffic at Southwest Airlines improved 1.9%, while capacity expanded 1.7%. Load factor increased 10 basis points to 85.8% in the same month.

1580,ALK,"Markets ended lower on Tuesday after shares of GE declined for the second straight day. Moreover, oil prices declined after International Energy Agency slashed its global crude-demand forecasts. This factor also weighed on the broader markets. Further, lingering tax-reform woes also dampened investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren commented that the Republican tax plan would eventually lead to an economic slowdown.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 23,409. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.2% to close at 2,578.87. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,737.87, declining 0.3%. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,775 to 1,054. On Nasdaq, declining issues outnumbered the advancing ones by 1,736 to 1,068. The CBOE VIX increased 0.8% to close at 11.59.General Electric and Tax Woes Weigh On the MarketsShares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) declined for the second straight day to hit its lowest levels since 2011. Shares of GE declined 5.9% on Tuesday, losing almost 12% in two days. On Monday, the company said that for the next year, the electric giant expects EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.07, which is significantly lower than the 2017 guidance of $1.05-$1.10 a share. The company also reduced its dividend by 50% in a bid to focus more on health care, aviation and energy business segments. The decline in the shares of GE weighed on the broader markets.Moreover, tax woes continued to worry the investors. Late last week, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focused on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans dampened investor sentiment and brought about broad based losses for the markets.How Did Benchmarks Perform?The Dow shed 30.23 points to end in the negative territory. This marked the blue-chip index’s third decline out of the last four sessions. Earlier in the session the Dow was down by as much as 170 points. Such a dismal run can partly be attributed to the decline in GE’s shares. Further, shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and DowDuPont (DWDP  -  Free Report) were all down 0.1%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq lost 19.72 points to also end in the red. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, the S&P 500 closed almost 6 points lower, with eight of its 11major sectors ending in losses. The S&P 500 has also finished three of the past four sessions in the red. Decliners were led by energy shares, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) dwindling 1.6%. Energy shares tanked following the release of a report by International Energy Agency in which the global body slashed global crude-demand forecasts and stated that U.S. shale-oil production will witness a boom in the near future. Such comments led to a decline in oil prices.Political Drama Keeps Investors ConfusedSpeaking at a Center for American Progress Action Fund event, Democrat Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren warned of a possible economic slowdown on Tuesday if the Republican tax plan is implemented. She reasoned that such a plan would squeeze the tax revenues for infrastructure and retard economic growth.She also stated that the terms of the plan would actually lead to small business owners subsidizing big companies which in turn would lead to a crunch in tax revenues. Such comments from her come at a time when the investors are already battling tax-reform worries.Meanwhile, reports also surfaced from Wall Street Journal that the White House was considering Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz as a possible candidate for the second best job at tje Federal Reserve. Trump has already nominated Jerome Powell to fill in Yellen’s shoes post her retirement in February next year.

1582,ALK,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in ALK.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen nine estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $7.38 a share a month ago to its current level of $6.80.Also, for the current quarter, Alaska Air Group has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1 a share from $1.47 over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 22.4% in the past month.Alaska Air Group, Inc.

1586,ALK,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1587,ALK,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.4%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history. It outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 4.8%.However, recent weather-related disruptions have hurt the company severely. Hence, an earnings beat is quite unlikely to happen in Alaska Air’s favor this quarter.Factors at PlayOf late, Alaska Air has been lying low due to escalating costs. The increase in fuel costs is expected to limit the company’s bottom-line growth in the third quarter. Fuel cost is projected to be $1.76 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting an approximate 12% jump over the year-ago figure.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus estimate for third-quarter has been revised downward 15.6% over the last 90 days.Also in May, the pilots of Alaska Air Group’s subsidiary, Horizon Air, had approved an amendment to the existing eight-year pay-related contract. This, in turn has spiked the labor costs, shooting up pilots’ compensation following the amendment. This is likely to put further pressure on the company’s bottom line in the third quarter.Even though the Virgin America deal — the company acquired Virgin America in December 2016 — looks positive, we note that this transaction like any other merger, has integration risks attached to it. Similar to the previous quarter, merger-related costs are predicted to hurt Alaska Air’s bottom line in the third quarter as well.Due to the above-mentioned headwinds, shares of the company have lost 10.7% of its value in the last three months against the industry’s 0.3% gain, over the same period.  However, the company’s expansion initiatives are impressive. In August, the company announced a customer-friendly deal with Singapore Airlines. Accordingly, the two will form a codeshare agreement to allow sharing of flights, i.e., a passenger can avail any flight operated by either company covered under the contract, irrespective of the flight number. Also, from Sep 27 onward, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs have begun earning miles on the flight.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Alaska Air has an Earnings ESP of -3.40% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged lower at $2.24 than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alaska Air carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1588,ALK,"Industrial goods manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Ingersoll has a healthy earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, it topped earnings estimates thrice with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderIngersoll is focusing on improving efficiencies and capabilities of products and services within its core businesses after the divesture of the commercial and residential security businesses. On the other hand, strategic acquisitions have served as growth drivers, supplementing the company’s organic growth. Furthermore, Ingersoll is likely to achieve steady improvements in operating profitability with new product developments, investments in IT platform and enhancement of channel services footprint and product management capabilities.The company has a solid foundation of global brands and a leading market share in all major product lines. The geographic and industrial diversity, coupled with a large installed product base provide ample growth opportunities within service, spare parts and replacement revenue streams. Additionally, the company’s complementary portfolio of products and services is likely to assist in strengthening its market position and achieving high productivity.However, Ingersoll continues to reposition its portfolio to focus on high-barrier markets. While such efforts are encouraging, they involve upfront costs which will lead to earnings dilution in the near term. Consequently, the company is continually under stress to maintain profitability through stringent cost-cutting measures. Additionally, its international operations are subject to economic risks. Results of the operations may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulation.Also, its significant international presence exposes it to political and economic disruptions, all of which can directly impact its profits. This gives rise to some concerns regarding its growth potential in the coming quarters, in the light of macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil that is afflicting some economies.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ingersoll is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the consensus estimate are both pegged at $1.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland) Price and EPS Surprise  Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland) Price and EPS Surprise | Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland) QuoteZacks Rank: Ingersoll’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes an earnings beat unlikely this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #3.Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1589,ALK,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings numbers on Jul 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company saw a negative earnings surprise of 3.10%. However, it has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the other three preceding quarters. The average beat in the last four quarters was 1.89%.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Allegiant is likely to beat on earnings this quarter, since it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.34%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.97, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.96. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allegiant carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Conversely, all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors at PlayThe company issued a bullish guidance with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) for the second quarter, while releasing its June traffic results. The metric is expected to grow in the band of 2.7-3.1%, up from its previous guidance of 1.5-3.5%. This significant increase in the lower end of the guidance is very encouraging. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up 6.1% in the last one month.Additionally, we are impressed by Allegiant’s efforts to reward its shareholders. The company’s efforts to expand are also encouraging. To this end, in Jun 2017, the company announced 28 new routes from the U.S. cities namely, Gulfport, MS; Norfolk, VA and Milwaukee, WI. The flights will be available for as low as $29.However, we remain mindful of the high labor costs, which might hurtthe bottom line in the second quarter.Allegiant Travel Company Price and EPS Surprise  Allegiant Travel Company Price and EPS Surprise | Allegiant Travel Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader transportation sector may also consider other top-ranked stocks like American Airlines Group, Inc.

Moreover, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 16.62%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect Trinity Industries to continue struggling on the top-line front in the to-be-reported quarter just like the previous quarter. Weak market conditions as well as sluggish demand for railcars are expected to weigh on the results this quarter. High costs and adverse foreign currency movement may also prove to be detrimental.In fact, the Rail Group segment that recorded disastrous results in the first quarter, is expected to continue its poor run in the second quarter as well. Also, the Inland Barge Group might come up with a below-par performance, mainly due to lower barge deliveries and changes in product mix.Additionally, the Energy Equipment Group might perform poorly in the quarter mainly due to lower delivery volumes.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.61, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.53. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Please note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors at PlayThe company’s improvement in the unit revenue scenario is expected to aid results in the second quarter. In June,the carrier raised its second quarter projection pertaining to the revenue per ASM (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) due to better-than-expected yields mainly in the domestic network. Additionally, fuel cost per gallon (economic) is now projected in the band of $1.6--$1.7 (earlier range was tuned at $1.65–$1.75) in the second quarter of 2017.Hawaiian Holdings’ growth is supported by strong demand for air travel to Hawaii. Also, the carrier’s efforts to expand internationally raise positivity. Also, it has an impressive track record with respect to punctuality. The company’s second-quarter results are expected to get a boost from these factors.However, similar to the previous quarter, higher costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the second quarter as well. In addition, consolidated CASM (excluding fuel) is projected to increase significantly in the quarter to be reported.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

1594,ALK,"JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.17%. Also, it has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.76%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that JetBlue is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as well on the back of its perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +5.46%.

This serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: JetBlue currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of JetBlue’s Zacks Rank #2 and an ESP of +5.46% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat at the same time around.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?The improved unit revenue scenario should aid JetBlue’s second-quarter results. The positive sentiment regarding the stock can be gauged from the 7.8% increase in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter to 55 cents per share over the last seven days.In May 2017, the carrier issued a bullish view on revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the second quarter of 2017. The company expects RASM to grow in the band of 4–6%. Capacity in the second quarter is also expected to grow in the same range.JetBlue’s expansion efforts are also appreciative. The company announced enhanced flight service between Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Mexico City International Airport (MEX) as well as between Orlando International Airport and MEX in May this year. JetBlue aims to increase flights to four daily roundtrips between Mexico City and the U.S. – two each on the Fort Lauderdale and Orlando routes.The carrier’s efforts to reduce debt levels are also impressive. Additionally, its cost control measures will aid the second-quarter results. The airline entered into a deal with Goldman Sachs in Apr 2017 to implement an accelerated share buyback program. This is a further positive which is expected to drive the second-quarter results.However, high labor costs are expected to hurt the bottom line in second-quarter 2017. Cost per available seat miles (CASM: excluding fuel) is anticipated to grow in the band of 4.5-6.5% in the quarter.JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | JetBlue Airways Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader transportation sector may also consider American Airlines Group, Inc.

1595,ALK,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.81%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at playThe carrier is leaving no stone unturned to rebound from the infamous passenger dragging incident in April. In fact, the company has also changed its policy on crew-booking and announced 10 measures like limiting the use of law enforcement for safety and security issues, to improve the flying experience of travellers and avoid repetition of the incident.Moreover, improving unit revenue trends should aid results in the quarter. The company expects passenger unit revenues for the to-be-reported quarter to increase approximately 2% on a year-over-year basis (which is at the midpoint of the previously guided range of 1% to 3%). Pre-tax margin (adjusted) is also projected in the band of 12.5% to 13.5%. United Continental expects consolidated capacity for the quarter to grow 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the company’s efforts to reward its shareholders are also encouraging.However, high costs are likely to hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. With the company inking multiple labor deals, related costs have shot up. Second-quarter cost per available seat mile (CASM: excluding profit sharing, fuel & third party business cost) is anticipated to increase in the band of 3%–3.5% on higher labor costs.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for United Continental this quarter.

The stock market is also at record levels.
