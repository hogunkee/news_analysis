7,MTB,"XThe market's rebound Tuesday sent a pair of midcap funds to the brink of a potential breakout.Vanguard Mid-Cap Value (VOE) extended its win streak to five Tuesday and closed a few pennies shy of a 104.41 flat-base buy point. If it clears the entry, that would mark its third breakout since late last year with respective 6% and 4% gains in between the flat-base patterns.The $7.5 billion fund, launched in August 2006, tracks the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Value Index. Financial services accounted for VOE's biggest sector weighting as of April 30, at nearly 21% of assets. Consumer cyclicals was next at 19%, technology 12% and utilities 9%. Top holdings included Western Digital (WDC), Newell Brands (NWL), M&T Brands (MTB) and KeyCorp (KEY).Western Digital made a solid showing Tuesday, bouncing back above its 50-day moving average. Shares have rallied 33% this year. Another big holding, Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), has sailed ahead 35% YTD and is near all-time highs.VOE has underperformed the S&P 500 this year, rising 7.1% vs. the benchmark index's 9.5% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. But it's slightly ahead over the five- and 10-year periods with respective average annual returns of 16.6% and 7.53% vs. the S&P 500's 15.3% and 7.3%.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility Portfolio (XMLV) is also on the cusp of a potential breakout, in this case past a 44.05 flat-base entry. The $1.04 billion ETF has formed a series of flat bases during the past year. The biggest advance in between was a 4.5%, one-month run from a late-January breakout.XMLV, launched in February 2013, tracks the S&P MidCap Low Volatility Index. The top sector weightings are real estate at about 20%, financial services 19%, utilities 17% and consumer cyclicals at 13%. RenaissanceRe Holdings (RNR), Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY) and Westar Energy (WR) were among its top holdings as of June 8, according to Morningstar.The ETF's YTD and one-year returns have lagged the S&P 500, but a 14.6% three-year average annual return is ahead of the S&P 500's 10.3% advance.Moving on to Tuesday's picks, both ETFs are in buy range from their respective entries. SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) cleared a 38.51 flat-base buy point in a fifth straight advance, while SPDR Technology (XLK) followed through on a Monday rebound off its 50-day moving average line.RELATED: ETF Breakout Watch Picks In Buy Range As Market Rebounds2 Top Picks For ETF Watch Could Offer Chance To BuyWhich 2 Key Index Funds Bucked The Rout To Stay Near Buy Points?

12,MTB,"HealthEquity (HQY), whose health savings accounts could get a lift from GOP plans to repeal and replace ObamaCare, beat fourth-quarter forecasts Tuesday but gave mixed fiscal-year guidance amid reports that President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are continuing to run into Republican opposition to the legislation.Q4 Estimates: EPS to drop 43% to 4 cents, marking its first earnings decline since going public in 2014, while revenue climbs 27% to $45.6 million.Results: EPS of 7 cents on revenue of $46.8 million. Service revenue rose 21% to $20.6 million, custodial revenue jumped 44% to $16 million, interchange revenue climbed 33% to $10.1 million. At the end of Q4, HSA members were up 28% from a year ago at 2.7 million.Outlook: Full-year EPS of 50-55 cents, below consensus for 56 cents, on revenue of $220 million-$225 million, with the midpoint above consensus for $221.6 million.Stock: HealthEquity was up 3% at 45.00 late. The IBD 50 member, which carries a 94 Composite Rating, closed down 5% at 43.63 on the stock market today, diving below its 50-day average and threatening to unravel the cup base with a 49.35 buy point that had formed.HealthEquity shares soared immediately after the presidential election, as Trump's campaign pushed HSAs in a promised overhaul of health policies. But any problems that the health effort runs into could also put other legislative GOP priorities, like tax cuts, in trouble.IBD'S TAKE: Health savings accounts are becoming the norm at U.S. corporations, and HealthEquity expects HSAs to become as ubiquitous as retirement savings vehicles like 401(k)s.There are few pure-play HSA players in the market, and most of HealthEquity's competition comes from banks and brokerages. HSA assets at HealthEquity were bolstered last year by the acquisition of 195,000 accounts with $453 million in assets from M&T Bank (MTB) and Bancorp (TBBK).Meanwhile, HealthEquity also wants customers to see their HSAs as investment and savings accounts vs. simply accounts for health-related expenses.The company was the first HSA administrator to offer individualized, web-based investment advisory services.

13,MTB,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Volume in the stock market today declined roughly 15% on the NYSE and 10% on the Nasdaq from the previous session's pace, according to preliminary figures.Follow-up action has been rather weak among the major indexes, but small caps and select sectors have done very well. Bulls would like to see some days of big gains in rising volume.Banks have been the star sector recently.

Nine bank stocks now make up about half of the Big Cap 20, which is a list of the best big caps by fundamentals and technicals. On Tuesday, bank winners led losers in the Big Cap 20.Big Cap 20 members Morgan Stanley (MS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF) each rose more than 1%, according to preliminary data. Goldman Sachs (GS), Citizens Financial Bank (CFG) and SunTrust Banks (STI) scored smaller gains. M & T Bank (MTB) lost ground.The construction aggregates and cement stocks also have been leaders. But Tuesday, they were taking a timeout. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) recorded losses but without damaging the overall bullishness of their chart patterns.Meanwhile, economic news was mostly positive.Retail sales for October were stronger than expected, and September results were revised upward. The Street expected a 0.6% pop in October, but the percentage came in at 0.8% — above the highest estimate in the range.

19,MTB,"Health savings accounts are quickly becoming the norm at corporations throughout the U.S., and top HSA administrator HealthEquity (HQY) expects these accounts to one day serve the same role as other retirement savings vehicles.To be sure, high-deductible medical insurance plans are on the rise. For one there is a ""tax savings bonanza from contributing to an HSA as your first place to build savings,"" according to HealthEquity Senior Vice President of Products Brad Bennion.Speaking on the company's recent conference call, Bennion was echoing sentiments from personal finance guru Suze Orman during the company's partner summit in July. Bennion also points out a number of key benefits, such as lower insurance premiums and lower net deductibles.""While only about 14% of working Americans have HSAs today, eventually, HSAs will become ubiquitous, as common as other retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs,"" Bennion said. He added: ""They will be used not only for current health care spending but for long-term health care saving and retirement planning, resulting in higher asset balances.""According to Denevir Research, HSA assets could reach between $600 billion and $1 trillion at market maturity, compared with $30 billion currently. So far, HealthEquity has outperformed the industry when it comes to the growth of assets under management.In the most recent quarter, HealthEquity's total assets grew 60% year-over-year to more than $4.2 billion. Denevir notes that industry-wide assets under management grew 22% during the second quarter.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Sandy Draper says the quantity of accounts and assets under management are two key long-term drivers.""While assets under management for the broad HSA market are expected to grow at a compounded rate over 20% from 2012-2018, we expect (assets under management) under HQY to clock in a 40%+ (compounded annual growth rate),"" Draper said in an Aug. 22 research report.HealthEquity's market-leading position is translating to market-share gains. Draper estimates the company took a 6% share the last three years but will reach 10% of the market by the end of 2016, and 12% by 2018.There are few pure-play HSA players in the market; most of HealthEquity's competition comes from banks and brokerages. HSA assets at HealthEquity have recently been bolstered by the acquisition of 195,000 accounts with $453 million in assets from M&T Bank (MTB) and Bancorp (TBBK) near the beginning of the year.HealthEquity Chief Executive Jon Kessler attributed the second-quarter asset gains to ""strong organic growth"" while portfolio acquisitions were ""modest.""And as far as membership goes, HealthEquity has seen strong gains there as well. Kessler said in the second-quarter conference call that HSA members grew 50% year-over-year to 2.3 million vs. 45% growth in the comparable period a year ago.Consumers opened 84,998 new HealthEquity HSAs in the second quarter, which was up 21% year-over-year, Kessler noted. Those members are adding more to their accounts, too.""Year-to-date, new HSA openings are up 27% and members have added 68% more (assets) over the last six months than they did in the first six months of last year,"" Kessler said.Along with HealthEquity's stellar financial growth, the stock has seen impressive gains. After hitting an all-time low in February, shares have risen more than 130% since. That move has been punctuated by an Aug. 29 breakout past a flat base with a 31.79 buy point.Volume was strong on the breakout day and has been for many up days afterward, amid strong earnings, which indicates institutional support. HealthEquity has been climbing rapidly of late, rising 3.6% on Thursday to 37.49, though it retreated 1.3% to close at 37 on Friday. Shares now are extended more than 16% from the buy point, closing in on the 20% profit-taking zone and passing its November 2015 peak to hit a new all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for top-rated stocks in or near buy zones to add to your watch list? Check out Leaderboard, IBD's curated list of leading growth stocks with actionable trading opportunities. The Relative Strength Line has been hitting new high ground, which is another bullish sign.With strong performances in the technical and fundamental arenas, HealthEquity earns a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. The Composite Rating looks at a variety of factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance vs. the S&P 500.HealthEquity reported estimate-beating fiscal second-quarter results on Sept. 6, with earnings up 78% to 16 cents a share. That figure topped views for 13 cents and was an acceleration from the 50% gain seen in the first quarter.The bottom-line beat was helped by margin expansion, and JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill notes the company's strong operating leverage.""The quarter's strong margin expansion was a reflection of HQY's business model leverage, which accelerates as it gains scale,"" Gill said in a Sept. 6 report.Meanwhile, revenue grew 45% to $44.2 million, surpassing expectations for $43.38 million and marking an eighth straight quarter of more than 40% top-line growth.HealthEquity upped its full-year revenue outlook range by $1 million, now seeing $174 million to $178 million vs. analyst views for $176.48 million. The company slightly raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance as well, but said it would no longer provide non-GAAP earnings-per-share projections.HSA investment accounts currently make up a small portion of total HSA assets, but they're expected to grow from 11.5% of total assets under management in 2015 to nearly 17% in 2018.One way HealthEquity can inform its customers about this emerging investment vehicle is through its website, which it has improved in recent months to include more educational features. Users can manage their spending and learn more about HSAs on the platform through videos, interactive quizzes and other tools.""(Some) 26% of our members visit our platform every month, ultimately allowing our network partners to engage members in everything that we have to offer by meeting members where they are,"" Bennion said.He added: ""This ability to respond to a fast-growing market is something that only a company that owns its own platform can do.""

22,MTB,"Even as the Federal Reserve signals that tougher standards lie ahead for its annual stress tests, banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC) and others could still get more generous with their payouts as the tests become more routine, analysts suggest.After the Fed approved 31 of 33 bank capital plans late Wednesday, JPMorgan announced a $10.6 billion buyback, Bank of America OK'd a $5 billion repurchase and a 50% payout increase, and Citigroup unveiled a $8.6 billion buyback and more than tripled its dividend. Morgan Stanley (MS) hiked its dividend 33% and announced a $3.5 billion buyback.The results ""highlight the capital strength that enabled the sector to broadly increase payout requests,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement Thursday, later adding that banks are ""becoming increasingly comfortable with the annual process.""As massive as the shareholder returns unveiled Wednesday were, there appears to be room for more among giants like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, based on the ratio of dividends and buybacks vs. earnings expected over the next year.Comerica (CMA) and M&T Bank (MTB) lead banks with net payout ratios of 119% each, followed by Morgan Stanley at 105%, according to Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's is 73%, while the ratio for both Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) is 65%, Citigroup's is 63%, and Bank of America's is 49%.Shares of Morgan Stanley climbed 3% on the stock market today. JPMorgan added 1.5%. Bank of America and Citigroup rose 0.6%. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.1%.Even before the stress test results came out, analysts have been expecting the banks to get more aggressive with shareholder returns after finally emerging from the aftereffects of the financial crisis.A CLSA note this month said JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are likely to hand out a bigger chunk of profits over the next four years, meaning greater gains for investors who stuck with them through lean times.Portales Partners this month said it expects banks ""to get more creative in their capital return requests, as the companies are becoming more familiar with the process"" of submitting capital plans for the stress tests, as well as resubmitting them if the Fed has any concerns with risk assessment or whether banks' dividend and buyback plans could overburden their finances if the economy falters.But even as banks push the envelope on capital returns and become more accustomed to the yearly drill of visualizing their state of affairs in an economic crisis, the Fed has warned of potentially stricter capital requirements in future tests.""The Fed noted that, despite general progress, banks still need to improve internal controls around various elements of capital planning,"" Fitch said.
"
23,MTB,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

38,MTB,"Bank stocks have been rallying amid an improving economy and the expectation of higher interest rates, but will the rally continue when second-quarter results start filtering in during July?Financial services specialist Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expects a ""challenging"" second quarter for the big money-center banks amid margin pressures and lower-than-expected trading revenue.As for large regional banks: KBW notes that Wall Street analysts expect residential-mortgage and credit-card balances to rebound in the second quarter, helping to drive commercial and consumer loan growth.Still, KBW analysts expect continued net interest margin compression in the sector.In its second-quarter preview of bank stocks, Deutsche Bank research analysts see ""less upside in the near term,"" given that the big money-center bank stocks have ""rallied nicely"" since last July.So what are their top bank-stock picks?Deutsche Bank's top names among the biggest bank stocks are JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).The former's net interest margin ""may positively surprise,"" Deutsche Bank said, and JPMorgan Chase might also have lower expenses and a decent return on capital.Cost cuts will also likely impact Bank of America positively, the analysts noted. Their ""buy"" rating also reflects ""large leverage to higher interest rates"" and reduced concerns over capital levels.Among the large regional banks, both Deutsche Bank and KBW give high ratings to Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI) as it continues to better manage expenses and its balance sheet.KBW cites SunTrust, Northern Trust (NTRS) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) as the three big regional banks likely to beat Wall Street earnings estimates in Q2.IBD also rates Northern Trust highly, with a Composite Rating of 87 out of a possible 99. Zions has an 80 score, SunTrust a 78 and JPMorgan a 75.Deutsche Bank also has a buy rating on Buffalo, NY-based M&T Bank (MTB) ahead of a long-awaited deal to acquire Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK), which it expects to occur later this year.

In other words: more payouts for shareholders.The U.S. units of Spain's Banco Santander (SAN) and Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) failed round 2 of the Fed's stress tests, while the Fed ordered Bank of America  (BAC) to resubmit its capital plan by the end of the third quarter.It's the second straight year Santander failed the test. And the Fed cited ""numerous and significant deficiencies"" in Deutsche Bank's capital planning.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted their dividends and Morgan approved a new buyback plan, joining other banks that received the Fed's OK of their capital plans.Shares of BofA fell 1% late, while Morgan Stanley rose 2% and Wells Fargo edged up 0.1%.The second round of the exams — the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — is more stringent than round one, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), because it examines banks' abilities to pay dividends, buy back shares and still serve borrowers during times of severe economic distress.This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.A More Likely Place To TripRound 2 is where banks are more likely to stumble.

58,MTB,"The Finance sector was one of the best performers in the Q1 earnings season. Despite rising chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on the banks’ strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects. Moreover, easing of regulations, financial stability and tax reform are expected to yield improved profitability for banks.With organic and inorganic growth strategies, as well as a robust capital position, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. The company’s focus on the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry to tackle macroeconomic headwinds and strategic priorities, including core technology infrastructure, is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.M&T Bank beat estimates in the first quarter, though the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged for 2018, over the last 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 inched up, reflecting analysts’ optimism about the company’s future prospects, during the same time frame.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained around 9.6% over the past year compared with 12.8% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, M&T Bank has a number of other aspects which make it an attractive investment option.Why M&T Bank is a Must Buy  Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a continued rise in net interest income. Over the past five years (ended December 2017), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 9%, with the trend continuing in the first quarter of 2018 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 4.47% indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 33.41% compared to the industry average rate of 31.28%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.96%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The growth has been reflected in the company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the past several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Furthermore, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital-deployment activities remain impressive. The company’s 2017 capital plan was approved by the Fed. The plan included share buyback of up to $900 million over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Notably, in February 2018, it announced an additional share buyback plan of up to $745 million. The latest quarterly common stock dividend hike was 7% in May 2018. Notably, the bank has cleared the 2018 stress test and awaits capital plan approval.Stock is Undervalued: The stock currently has a Value Score of B. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of “value traps” and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Strong Leverage: M&T Bank’s debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.59 compared to the industry average of 0.92, indicating relatively lower debt burden. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days. Additionally, the stock jumped over 23% in the past year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Old Second Bancorp, Inc.

59,MTB,"On May 28, we issued an updated research report on The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report). The company’s cost-containment efforts to drive operational efficiency along with steady loan and deposit growth indicate its upside potential. However, lack of loan diversification remains a concern.The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.6%.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up slightly to $10.54 for the current year. Hence, PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Further, shares of this banking giant have recorded a year-to-date return of 3.7% against slight decline for the industry.PNC Financial’s efforts to reduce expenses keep us encouraged. The company successfully realized its continuous improvement savings program (CIP) goals for the last three years (ended 2017) of about $1.25 billion. For 2018, management has a CIP target of $250 million. The company's consistent focus on core expense management might help generate positive operating leverage in the quarters ahead.The company’s strong balance sheet position enables it to strengthen business through strategic initiatives. In 2017, PNC Financial acquired companies, which helped it expand product offering and presence. Thus, the company’s bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments.With one of the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry, PNC Financial continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. A rising rate environment has helped ease margin pressure greatly, in turn boosting its net interest income. Further, the company’s fee income depicted upward movement in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue increasing with the execution of strategic initiatives.However, a significant portion of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio comprises commercial loans. Such high exposure to commercial loans depicts lack of diversification, which can be risky for the company amid a challenging economy and competitive markets.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has witnessed an 5.1% upward estimate revision for current-year earnings in the last 60 days.

60,MTB,"In the Q1 earnings season, the Finance sector turned out to be one of the best performers. Particularly, benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest-rate scenario have well positioned the banking industry. Moreover, lower commercial tax rate are likely to further boost banks’ profitability.In addition, relieving banks from some of the stringent requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act has made the companies optimistic of future earnings growth and raised investors’ sentiments as well. So, we thought of bringing up a stock from the sector that reflects strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.Particularly, Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV  -  Free Report) is one such stock that not only beat estimates this time, but has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 jumped 5% and 6.5%, respectively.Synovus can be a solid bet now on the back of its organic and inorganic growth strategies which have placed it well for the future. Moreover, the company’s focus on balance-sheet growth is encouraging.Furthermore, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have gained 9.6% in the last six months, outperforming 7.3% growth recorded by the industry.5 Reasons Why Synovus is an Attractive Buy  Revenue Growth: Organic growth remains a key catalyst for Synovus, with its net interest income witnessing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.7% over the past four years (2014–2017). Also, loans have increased at a CAGR of 5.5% for the last four years (2014–2017). In first-quarter 2018, the increasing trend continued for both loans and NII.Additionally, the company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 5.28% (compared with 3.17% growth for the industry) ensures continuation of uptrend in the top line.Earnings Strength: Synovus has witnessed historical (3–5 years) earnings per share growth of 31.6% compared with 15% for the industry. In addition, the company’s estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 8.0% promises rewards for investors. Synovus also recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 4.85%, over the trailing four quarters.Steady Capital Deployment: Synovus remains committed toward creating value for its shareholders through dividend hikes, share buybacks and acquisitions, thereby reflecting strong balance-sheet position. In October 2016, the company acquired Entaire Global Companies, Inc. In September 2017, the company also completed the purchase of Cabela's banking operation. Further, the board of directors has authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $150 million shares in 2018. Also, in March 2018, it announced a 67% hike in quarterly dividend.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Synovus’ ROE of 12.29%, as compared with the industry average of 8.78%, indicates the company’s commendable position over its peers.Strong Leverage: Synovus’ debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.66 compared to the S&P 500 average of 0.68, reflecting lower debt burden relative to the industry. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in an unstable economic environment.Other Stocks to ConsiderM&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last seven days.

61,MTB,"Per a Bloomberg article, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) plans to boost auto lending business as CEO Tim Sloan finds the commercial real estate (CRE) unit to be a concern.In an interview with Bloomberg, Sloan commented on auto lending by saying, “we’ve pulled back enough and now we’re going to be growing that business again”. In mid-2017, the bank had reduced focus on this business due to fall in reselling value for cars. Decline in prices made it difficult for the bank to offset losses by repossessing cars in cases of default by borrowers.However, in February 2018, Wells Fargo indicated plans to consolidate its auto lending units and put the division back on track within two quarters.Regarding CRE, Sloan said that some deals had been insignificant. He noted that 2018 gave a good start to the business. The market at the time was enjoying benefits from lower tax rates and improved consumer spending, which made the buyers more aggressive.Having seen so much since the fake account scandal in September 2016, troubles at Wells Fargo still seem to continue. Last week, the bank brought to the notice of the regulators that employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information of clients, without their knowledge, between late 2017 and first few months of 2018.Affected by a horde of scandals, Wells Fargo has been trying hard to control costs and concentrate on more profitable segments. In its Investors’ Day, held on May 10, the bank said that it expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019.We believe that Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan will help it deal with persistent legal expenses. Also, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position supported by lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 2.2% in the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 18.1%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

62,MTB,"Shares of TCF Financial Corporation (TCF  -  Free Report) climbed 7.27% in single-day trading following the first-quarter 2018 earnings release on Apr 23, before the market opened. The company reported earnings per share of 39 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents.Further, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 25 cents. Notably, results include non-recurring items of 2 cents per share associated with the redemption of perpetual preferred stock.Also, top-line strength was experienced in the reported quarter. Furthermore, margin pressure seems to be easing. The quarter also witnessed continued rise in loans and deposits, while maintaining a solid capital position and lower provisions. However, elevated expenses were on the downside.The company reported net income of $73.8 million or 39 cents compared with $46.3 million or 25 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsTotal revenues came in at $355.4 million in the quarter, up 9.1% year over year. Moreover, the top line comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $349.4 million.Net interest income (NIM) was up nearly 9.5% year over year to $243.2 million. The rise was mainly attributable to increased interest income on loans and leases held for investment, partially mitigated by decreased interest income on loans held for sale and rise in total interest expense.NIM of 4.59% expanded 13 basis points (bps) year over year due to elevated average yields on the variable and adjustable-rate loan portfolios on rising rates, partly offset by escalated average rates on increased average balances of certificates of deposit, along with higher average rates on long-term borrowings and savings accounts.Non-interest income came in at $112.2 million, up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis. Higher fees and other revenues, along with elevated card revenues, mainly led to the rise.TCF Financial reported non-interest expenses of $246 million, up 0.8% from the year-earlier quarter. The rise mainly reflected significant increase in operating lease depreciation, and higher occupancy and equipment expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, average deposits improved 7% year over year to $18.3 billion. Average loans and leases climbed 6.7% year over year to $19.3 billion in the reported quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit quality for TCF Financial reflected mixed credit metrics. Non-accrual loans and leases, and other real estate owned slipped 16% year over year to $143.6 million.Further, provisions for credit losses were $11.4 million, down 6.8% year over year, primarily due to the auto finance portfolio run-off and lower net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio. These benefits were partly mitigated by rise in net charge-offs in the consumer real estate portfolio.However, net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans and leases, expanded 18 bps year over year to 0.29%. The upsurge chiefly stemmed from the recovery recorded in the prior-year quarter, partly mitigated by lower net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio.Robust Capital PositionTCF Financial’s capital ratios remained strong. As of Mar 31, 2018, Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.57% compared with 10.79% as of Dec 31, 2017. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.26% compared with 13.90% as of Dec 31, 2017. Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.52%, down from 11.12% as of Dec 31, 2017.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 2.57 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $57.6 million and at an average price of $22.45 per share.Our ViewpointTCF Financial delivered an impressive performance in the first quarter. Continued top-line improvement underscores the company’s sturdy standing in the market. At the same time, a strengthening capital position and improving credit quality are anticipated to favor the company’s near-term growth. In addition to this, we believe its efforts to reduce balance-sheet risks and diversify the loan portfolio will augur well for earnings in the subsequent quarters. Also, steady improvement in the economy will be conducive for the company’s growth.Nevertheless, we remain apprehensive owing to several issues, including an expanding cost base. TCF Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TCF Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TCF Financial Corporation QuoteTCF Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, elevated expenses and provisions remained major drags.Driven by top-line strength, Texas Capital Bancshares Inc. (TCBI  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of around 0.7% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of $1.38 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Additionally, results compared favorably with 80 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter. Results were driven by rise in revenues. Organic growth was reflected, with significant rise in loans and deposit balances. However, elevated expenses and provisions were the undermining factors.M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report) reported net operating earnings of $2.26 per share in the first quarter. The bottom line improved 5.1% year over year. In addition, top-line growth was recorded. Moreover, improved credit quality was a positive factor. Further, pressure on margin eased. Nonetheless, decrease in loan and deposit balances was a headwind. Also, results were affected by flaring up expenses.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

63,MTB,"Huntington Bancshares (HBAN  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 28 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of 21 cents.Results were driven by higher revenues and lower provisions. Continued growth in both loan and deposit balances was also recorded. Moreover, lower expenses were the primary tailwinds.Net income surged nearly 28.3% year over year to $326 million during the quarter.Revenues, Loans & Deposits Escalate, Expenses DropThe company’s total revenues on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis came in at $1.09 billion in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion. However, total revenues were up 3% year over year.Net interest income (NII) came in at $777 million on a FTE basis, up 5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in average earnings assets.  Net interest margin (NIM) remained unchanged at 3.30%.Non-interest income inched up 1% year over year to $314 million. The upsurge mainly stemmed from growth in capital-market fees, cards and payment processing income, along with trust and investment-management services.Adjusted non-interest expense declined slightly to $633 million on a year-over-year basis. The decrease stemmed from a fall in almost all components of expenses, partially offset by rise in personnel costs. Including the impact of certain non-recurring items, non-interest expense dropped 10% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loans and leases at Huntington jumped nearly 5% year over year to $70.5 billion. Also, average total deposits ascended 1% year over year to $76.9 billion.Credit Quality Marks ImprovementNet charge-offs were $38 million or an annualized 0.21% of average total loans in the reported quarter, down from $39 million or an annualized 0.24% recorded in the year-ago quarter.Provision for credit losses was down 2.9% on a year-over year basis to $66 million. In addition, total non-performing assets totaled $420 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $458 million as of Mar 31, 2017.Further, the quarter-end allowance for credit losses, as a percentage of total loans and leases, edged down to 1.13% from 1.14% in the year-earlier quarter.Strong Capital RatiosHuntington Bancshares’ capital ratios remained strong.Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio were 10.51% and 11.99%, respectively, as compared with 9.74% and 13.26% reported in the year-ago quarter.Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.70%, up from 7.28% as of Mar 31, 2017.Outlook for 2018With improving macroeconomic environment and the company’s accomplishment of its core strategies, total revenues for full-year 2018 are projected to be up in the range of 4-6%. Non-interest expense is anticipated to be down 2-4%.The NIM for 2018 is estimated to remain flat as compared with the prior year, on a GAAP basis, as expansion in NIM might offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting. Further, efficiency ratio is projected at 55-57%.Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the 4-6% band on an annual basis, while average deposits are expected to be up 3-5%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35-55 basis points.The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated in the range of 15.5-16.5%.Our ViewpointHuntington reported an encouraging quarter.

Furthermore, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.4 million.Texas Capital’s net interest income was $210.3 million, up 28.7% year over year, mainly due to rise in loans held for investment, improved earning asset composition and loan yields.

67,MTB,"Shares of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) closed 1.7% higher yesterday, reflecting investors’ bullish stance on the bank’s impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets.During its Investors’ Day presentation held on May 10, Wells Fargo also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80% from 55-75% it had set in 2016.However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Let’s discuss the two keys takeaways of the presentation in details below.Impressive Cost-Savings PlanThe Sans Francisco-based bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Further, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry said that expenses for 2020 might be between $50 billion and $51 billion along with revenues consistent with 2017. However, he cautioned that it was not a formal projection and that the bank's will remain committed to improving revenues.Such measures will help the bank combat the persistent legal expenses. Also, this move might enable it to invest in productive areas.Lesser Impact on Earnings From Asset Cap, Time Period Might ExtendConsidering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank said that it expects the restriction’s impact on its net income after tax to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that slow growth in loans and deposits balance helped in reducing the impact to about $100 million.Also, after considering the restrictions, the bank was looking forward to continue building its balance sheet after a third-party review of its plans, to improve controls and governance, to be held in September 2018.However, on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the cap till the first part of 2019, in order to better enforce the plans to improve operations.Our ViewpointWells Fargo’s CEO, Tim Sloan, has launched a new advertising campaign with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices. On the other hand, it continues to settle past misconducts and accept penalties.It is uncertain when the bank will be able to get past the legal hassles and strict regulatory scrutiny. Further, unstable revenues remain another key concern for Wells Fargo. However, its expense control initiative might allow some room to deal with the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 3.1% over the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 18%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

69,MTB,"Amid an expected weakness in investment banking, strong trading results, higher rates and lower tax rate drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $2.37 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28. The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter.Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Shares of JPMorgan rose nearly 1.4% in the pre-market trading, indicating that investors have taken the results in their stride. Notably, the full-day trading session will depict a better picture.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth. Further, higher equity trading income (up 26%) and fixed income trading (up 8%) supported the top line. Additionally, mortgage banking income witnessed a rise, driven by growth in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by fall in mortgage origination volume.Apart from these, the reported quarter recorded a decrease in provision for credit losses, mainly attributable to reserve release in Wholesale portfolio.As expected, investment banking performance slumped during the quarter. While advisory fees witnessed a modest rise, both equity and debt underwriting fees declined. Further, higher operating expenses was an undermining factor.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent.

These were partially offset by lower investment banking revenues.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $16.1 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher compensation expenses and auto loan depreciation.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for credit losses declined 11% year over year to $1.2 billion, primarily due to reserve release in Wholesale loan portfolio, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in Card.Also, as of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $6.4 billion, down 7% from the year-ago period. Also, net charge-offs were down 19% year over year to $1.3 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 13.5% as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 14.1% as of Mar 31, 2017.

70,MTB,"The rebound in trading business is likely to drive Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings, to be reported on Apr 17. Moreover, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of other segments — mainly investing and lending — are anticipated to aid earnings.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Notably, the quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter.Reversing the trend of the last couple of quarters, higher trading revenues are expected in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a rise of 19.2% sequentially.In additionally, investment management unit of Goldman is projected to aid earnings as increase in investments in fixed income, alternatives and low-cost index funds are expected to escalate management and other fees. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division projects a rise of 12.4% year over year.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q1 results:Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could impact revenues of Goldman.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are predicted to increase. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report a decent quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment banking segment is projected at $1.8 billion, up 12.5% year over year.Investing & Lending to Get a Boost: Higher asset values, improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to aid revenues from this source. In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up revenues. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investing and lending segment is projected at $1.6 billion, up 23.1% year over year.Strong Expense Management: Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will unlikely be a major support. Furthermore, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact Goldman’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

71,MTB,"The banking industry has been undergoing a massive overhaul since the past year and the same is expected to continue in the near term. Benefits from the efforts will support the banks’ financials, thus boosting their prospects.While price performance of banking stocks was not impressive in first-quarter 2018 due to several macroeconomic factors that led to huge sell offs, the stocks will be positively impacted by other factors in the quarters ahead.In the first three months of 2018, the Zacks Major Banks industry declined 2.7% while Banks & Thrifts rallied 1.2%. Notably, the Zacks Finance sector fell 2.1%, over the same time frame.Factors to Benefit Banks in Q2First and foremost is the rising rate environment. Continuation of hike in interest rates (driven by higher inflation prospects and low level of unemployment rate) and the unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet have the potential to boost banks’ revenues significantly. Therefore, this will likely keep the momentum going for the banks.Secondly, the new tax legislation will lower effective tax rates for some of the big names in the industry such as JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). This will, thus, enable them to earn more profit. Additionally, reduced tax rates will likely provide stimulus to the economy, therefore indirectly benefiting banks.Thirdly, banks’ continuous focus on digitization of banking operations reflects a move toward more customer friendly services. Banks have been undertaking efforts to align their banking network according to clients’ needs and upgrading ATMs with latest technology. These are expected to result in more customer engagement at a lower cost.Lastly, as the bill on rolling back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking legislation is expected to become a law soon, all banks, big-and-small are expected to reap benefits. The bill is aimed at lowering compliance costs and hence will help boost profitability.With banks gaining from the above-mentioned factors, this is the right time to add a few stocks to your portfolio at low prices and get attractive returns in the quarters ahead.Choosing the Winning Bank StocksThough all banks are expected to gain in the coming days, picking a handful of these is not an easy task.Hence, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlisted bank stocks with a projected first-quarter 2018 earnings growth rate of 10% or more and market capitalization greater than $2 billion.

73,MTB,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at MTB given that, according to its RSI reading of 28.20, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI?RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, MTB’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to M&T Bank’s earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 6 earnings estimate revision move higher, compared with 3 lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for MTB has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $12.25/share two months ago to $12.53/share right now.If this wasn’t enough, M&T Bank also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers.

75,MTB,"Ratings of Webster Financial Corporation (WBS  -  Free Report) and its bank subsidiary, Webster Bank N.A., was recently confirmed by Moody’s Investors Service. The outlook has remained stable.Wester Bank’s long and short-term deposits have been rated as A1/Prime-1 while standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) is rated a3 and its counterparty risk assessments are A2(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Webster Financial has a long-term issuer rating and a senior unsecured rating of Baa1. Further, the company’s shelf registration was rated (P)Baa1 for senior unsecured, (P)Baa1 for subordinate, (P)Baa2 for cumulative preferred stock and (P)Baa3 for non-cumulative preferred stock.Per Moody’s, the ratings affirmation reflects the company’s sustainable business model and ability to maintain credit quality with support from robust liquidity position and improving credit metrics.Webster has a strong deposit base accounting for about 116% of gross loans. Such impressive deposits balance enables the bank to depend less on funding from external sources. Further, the company holds liquid assets of about 25% of tangible banking assets.Also, Moody’s finds Webster’s asset quality to be strong as indicated by ration of non-performing loans to total loans of 1.5% (as of Mar 31, 2018). Also, slowdown in loan growth is considered a positive.  Further, the rating agency noted that the rising interest rates continue to benefit its bottom line as the company’s revenues are dependent on spread income, and its balance sheet remains asset-sensitive.The adjusted tangible common equity as a percentage of risk-weighted assets has been calculated as 10.9% for Webster’s as of Dec 31, 2017. Moody’s finds the ratio to match the similarly-rated peer median. However, its current capital levels limit upward rating pressure.  Ratings of Webster can be upgraded if it delivers a sustained improvement in capital and an above-average asset quality performance. On the flip side, a downward rating in its standalone BCA is plausible on account of aggressive capital actions and a reduction in liquid banking assets.Shares of Webster Financial have gained 32.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.2%.Currently, Webster Financial carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

76,MTB,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has landed in trouble again thanks to its employees, who reportedly modified or added false information related to corporate customers, without their knowledge, in order to meet a regulatory deadline. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Despite strict regulatory scrutiny and promises made by Wells Fargo to improve internal controls, disclosure of such misconducts continues to shake investors’ confidence in the stock. Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 1.5% in yesterday’s trading session. Per the report, the scandal happened between late 2017 and first few months of 2018. Employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information such as birth dates, social security numbers and addresses of clients during that period.Citing people familiar with the matter, Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo has been facing a Jun 30 deadline to comply with a regulatory order related to anti-money laundering controls.  In an internal investigation, Wells Fargo became aware of these misdoings. The matter is currently under investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.A spokeswoman at Wells Fargo said, ""This matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.""Last week, Wells Fargo had launched an ad-campaign — Re-Established — with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices.However, findings of these sort continue to test regulators tolerance toward Wells Fargo’s wrongdoings. In its Investors’ Day held on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the regulatory cap on its assets till the first part of 2019. This disclosure might extend that to an even longer time.Also, the company’s bottom-line remains under pressure due to unstable revenues.

77,MTB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MTB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.M&T Bank Q1 Earnings Improve Y/Y on Solid RevenuesM&T Bank reported net operating earnings of $2.26 per share in first-quarter 2018. The bottom line improved 5.1% year over year.In addition, top-line growth was recorded. Moreover, improved credit quality was a positive factor. Further, pressure on margin eased. However, decrease in loan and deposit balances was a headwind. Also, results were affected by higher expenses.Net operating income came in at $357 million, up around 1% year over year.On a GAAP basis, M&T Bank’s earnings per share of $2.23 jumped 5% year over year. Net income inched up 1% year over year to $353 million. Notably, litigation reserve has been increased by $135 million. On an after-tax basis, reserve reduced net income by $102 million, or 68 cents per share.NII & Fee Income Growth Boost Revenues, Expenses Flare UpM&T Bank’s revenues came in at $1.44 billion comparing favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.37 billion.Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 6% year over year to $980 million in the quarter, driven by increased net interest margin, partly offset by lower average earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points year over year to 3.71%.Supported by strong growth in trust income and distribution from Bayview Lending Group LLC, the company’s other income climbed 3% year over year to $459 million. These increases were partially offset by unrealized losses on investments in equity securities.Non-interest expenses were $933 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter. Excluding certain non-operating items, non-interest operating expenses came in at $927 million, escalating 19% from the year-ago quarter. The rise reflected increased litigation reserve, elevated salaries, and employee-benefit costs and other expenses.Efficiency ratio came in at 64% this quarter, up from 56.9% in the prior-year quarter. Rise in ratio indicates fall in profitability.Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, edged down 1.8% year over year to $87.7 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Additionally, total deposits declined 6.3% year over year to $90.9 billion.M&T Bank's net operating income highlighted an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder equity of 1.28% and 13.51%, respectively, compared with 1.21% and 13.05% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Credit Quality ImprovedM&T Bank reflected an improved credit quality picture in the reported quarter. Provision for credit losses shrunk 22% year over year to $43 million. Net charge-offs of loans came in at $41 million, down 5% year over year.Further, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total net loans was 0.99%, down from 1.04% in the comparable period last year. Non-performing assets decreased 8% year over year to $966 million.Strong Capital PositionM&T Bank’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets under regulatory capital rules was around 10.59%. Tangible equity per share came in at $66.99, slightly down year over year from $67.16.Share RepurchaseDuring first-quarter 2018, M&T Bank repurchased a total of 3.78 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $721 million.Outlook for 2018Management expects mortgage loan portfolio runoffs to continue in double digits in 2018. With attractive pricing and underwriting standards in the consumer area, loans balance is expected to either remain flat or grow in low single-digits, with paydowns and payoffs playing a major role.Based on the current level of rates and reflecting the impact of the interest rate hedges, the company entered last year, along with the anticipation of another 25-bps rate hike in 2018, management expects NIM to expand 5-8 bps. Therefore, with these assumptions, modest NII growth is predicted.Volumes and gain on sale margins of residential mortgage loan originations has been affected by the higher interest rate environment. Therefore, residential mortgage banking revenues might be under pressure. However, seasonal improvement in commercial mortgage banking revenues is anticipated as the year progresses.

79,MTB,"On May 15, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumped to touch its highest point since 2011. The immediate trigger for this jump was an increase in April retail sales. Data of this nature was indicative of the U.S. consumer’s strong purchasing power. Further, reports emerged that trade tensions between the United States and China were likely to continue. Trade-related tensions are likely to boost prices higher, which would depress bonds and boost yields. Though such an occurrence could weigh on broader markets, financials stocks, particularly banks would be benefited. This is because a spike in rates increases the yield spread for banks. Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point. Benchmark Yield Climbs as Retail Sales IncreaseOn Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased by 7.5 basis points to 3.070%. This is the highest level achieved since July 2011. It also marks the biggest single-day increase since March 1. Further, the yield also hit an intra-day peak of 3.093%. Notably, the day’s gains lifted the yield spread between the 10-year and 2-year rate to 48.5 basis points.The immediate trigger for the jump in the benchmark yield was bullish retail sales data for April. Retail sales increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% in April from March, according to the Commerce Department. March sales were, in fact, revised to show a 0.8% advance instead of 0.6%.Trade Tensions Likely to Remain High, Banks to GainAlso boosting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was the resurgence of trade-related tensions.  Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China commented on Tuesday the United States and China remain “very far apart” on settling trade-related disputes. Branstad’s views were in line with comments made by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on May 14.Tensions emanating from such a dispute can boost inflation levels and erode the value of fixed-income securities, thus pushing up yields higher. A sector which could immediately benefit from higher yield levels is banking.Shares of banks are bolstered by higher interest rates in the form of an uptick in bond yields. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. (Read: Resurgence of 10-Year Bond Yield: Winners & Losers)Our ChoicesThe rise in benchmark yield levels is primarily an outcome of encouraging retail sales numbers and the resurfacing of trade-related tensions. While unemployment is at a record low, a quick resolution to the trade dispute looking increasingly. This is why such inflationary pressures are unlikely to dissipate in the near-term.Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a profitable option at this time. This is because they are likely to benefit from the widening of the yield spread.

80,MTB,"Last Friday, as per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it had ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018. Per the filing “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018.Notably, Wells Fargo refrained from the allegations but said it had ""entered into the agreement in principle to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation.""“We are pleased to reach this agreement in principle and believe that moving to put this case behind us is in the best interest of our team members, customers, investors and other stakeholders,” noted CEO Tim Sloan. “We are making strong progress in our work to rebuild trust, and this represents another step forward,” he further added.The Story So FarThe above-mentioned case relates to the revelation of a sales scam, wherein the bank’s employees allegedly opened millions of unauthorized accounts illegally, to meet their aggressive internal sales goals.This financial bigwig has been under inquiry for setting impractical sales targets for its employees, compelling them to adopt fraudulent means for meeting the same. Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales tactics were first disclosed by The Los Angeles Times in 2013, when Los Angeles City’s Attorney Mike Feuer had begun investigation. This probe led to a lawsuit accusing the bank of high-pressure sales goals that encouraged unfair, illegal and fraudulent conduct, such as issuing unwanted credit cards to customers.The scandal was agitated in September 2016 following which the bank paid a combined penalty of $190 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the City and County of Los Angeles. In addition, the amount included $5 million in customer remediation.Per the above-discussed class action lawsuit, the investors’ claims included misappropriation of facts by Wells Fargo related to its cross-selling strategy which was not used for benefit of customers. However, the bank tried to ""designed to fulfill sales quotes or otherwise advance the interests of Wells Fargo or its employees and increase sources of profitability while simultaneously burdening customers with financial products they did not authorize, need and/or even know about,"" the suit claimed.Therefore, this led the shares to trade at ""artificially inflated prices,"" per the suit.Notably, investors filing the suit include buyers of Wells Fargo's shares between Feb 26, 2014, and Sep 15, 2016, following the bank’s $185-million settlement which resulted in a dip in its share prices. Union Investment — a European asset-management firm — was the lead plaintiff in the case, appointed by the court.Bottom LineCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.In February 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).Recently, the banking giant faced a penalty of $1 billion imposed by the CFPB and OCC due to its wrongdoings in the auto insurance and mortgage-lending business. As a result, the company’s first-quarter 2018 preliminary financial results got adjusted by an additional accrual of $800 million, which is not tax deductible. The accrual reduced the reported first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per share to $4.7 billion, or 96 cents per share.The bank’s performance over the past year underlines investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 4.8%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 12.3%. Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

The bottom line improved 5.1% year over year.In addition, top-line growth was recorded. Moreover, improved credit quality was a positive factor. Further, pressure on margin eased. However, decrease in loan and deposit balances was a headwind. Also, results were affected by higher expenses.Net operating income came in at $357 million, up around 1% year over year.On a GAAP basis, M&T Bank’s earnings per share of $2.23 jumped 5% year over year. Net income inched up 1% year over year to $353 million. Notably, litigation reserve has been increased by $135 million. On an after-tax basis, reserve reduced net income by $102 million, or 68 cents per share.NII & Fee Income Growth Boost Revenues, Expenses Flare UpM&T Bank’s revenues came in at $1.44 billion comparing favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.37 billion.Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 6% year over year to $980 million in the quarter, driven by increased net interest margin, partly offset by lower average earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points year over year to 3.71%.Supported by strong growth in trust income and distribution from Bayview Lending Group LLC, the company’s other income climbed 3% year over year to $459 million. These increases were partially offset by unrealized losses on investments in equity securities.Non-interest expenses were $933 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter. Excluding certain non-operating items, non-interest operating expenses came in at $927 million, escalating 19% from the year-ago quarter. The rise reflected increased litigation reserve, elevated salaries, and employee-benefit costs and other expenses.Efficiency ratio came in at 64% this quarter, up from 56.9% in the prior-year quarter. Rise in ratio indicates fall in profitability.Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, edged down 1.8% year over year to $87.7 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Additionally, total deposits declined 6.3% year over year to $90.9 billion.M&T Bank's net operating income highlighted an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder equity of 1.28% and 13.51%, respectively, compared with 1.21% and 13.05% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Credit Quality ImprovedM&T Bank reflected an improved credit quality picture in the reported quarter. Provision for credit losses shrunk 22% year over year to $43 million. Net charge-offs of loans came in at $41 million, down 5% year over year.Further, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total net loans was 0.99%, down from 1.04% in the comparable period last year.

We believe the company, with its sturdy business model and strategic acquisitions, is well poised for growth. The Hudson City acquisition has, in all probability, provided an upside to M&T Bank’s top line by leveraging on the retail network of the former, as well as product and balance-sheet diversification.However, regulatory issues and escalating costs remain headwinds for the bank. M&T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteCurrently, M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

83,MTB,"According to a Bloomberg report, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) will have to defend itself against the lawsuit filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance, accusing the bank of underpaying insurance premiums. The FDIC claims that BofA owes $542 million for deposit insurance.Yesterday, in a court ruling, BofA made a request for the dismissal of the lawsuit, which was probably denied by the judge.While details of the ruling have been sealed, District Judge Emmet Sullivan informed that the final decision will be made public after deciding which parts of the ruling need to be edited, by reviewing both the proposals by the bank and the regulator.In January 2017, a lawsuit was filed by the FDIC against BofA, claiming that the bank ignored FDIC’s instructions on how to account for its exposure to counterparties.In order to protect customers and guarantee them access to their deposits in times of a bank failure, the FDIC created an insurance fund, through which it insures bank deposits of up to $250,000. The fund is financed through risk-based insurance premiums paid by the covered banks.These firms have to report how much money is owed by their counterparties and according to the system, the more concentrated a bank's exposure to its counterparty, the higher its degree of risk.In 2011, the FDIC changed its rules, according to which banks were required to report counterparty exposure and payments owed by their parent companies as a whole, rather than individual units.However, per the lawsuit, BofA failed to abide by the rules and miscalculated its exposure to its largest counterparty that has not yet been identified in the complaint.Since BofA did not properly add up all the exposures at the parent level, it understated the amount of insurance protection that it owed to the 20 biggest counterparties for almost 2 years. The period in focus is from the second quarter of 2013 till the fourth quarter of 2014.However, BofA claims that it did comply with the FDIC rules at that time and it regularly updated the regulator on its calculations.According to the bank, the matter could have been resolved through discussions rather than litigation.Though BofA has resolved quite a many litigation issues, it still faces investigations from several federal agencies and a few foreign governments for its business conducts in the pre-crisis period. Hence, legal expenses might increase its overall costs, hurting the bottom-line growth.Shares of the company have gained 26.4% in the past year, outperforming the 12.6% rally of the industry.Currently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are BankUnited, Inc.

84,MTB,"Per a Reuters article, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) plea to fully dismiss a lawsuit which accused it of practicing discriminatory mortgage lending practices was dismissed by the U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman.BackgroundIn December 2014, Illinois' Cook County had filed a lawsuit against the bank alleging it of targeting minority borrowers in the Chicago area and violating the Fair Housing Act (FHA). Wells Fargo was charged of making them borrow loans that were too costly for them, which resulted in higher fees, frequent defaults and foreclosures. Also, the bank was accused of offering bonuses to employees who were successful in giving such loans.In the lawsuit, the county also alleged Wells Fargo of engaging in the practice of ""equity stripping"" in order to maximize the income and assets the bank could generate by originating or acquiring high-cost and other nonprime mortgage loans.In July 2017, Wells Fargo had requested the federal court at Chicago to dismiss the lawsuit saying that the county failed to show that the bank had directly caused the harms alleged in the lawsuit.Judge’s DecisionFeinerman allowed the county to pursue federal Fair Housing Act claims against Wells Fargo to the extent the bank's alleged ""equity stripping"" practices boosted the cost of administering and processing a higher number of foreclosures.Per the article, Feinerman dismissed claims alleging harm from lost property taxes, the need to combat crime and blight, racial segregation and other factors, calling them ""ripples"" that ""flow far beyond"" Wells Fargo's alleged misconduct.Also, the federal judge stated that the cities are eligible to pursue FHA claims so long as they are successful in establishing a ""direct"" link between the alleged misconduct and the resulting harm.Our TakeLegal hassles at Wells Fargo seem unlikely to end soon. Thus, legal costs are likely to hurt its bottom-line growth. However, its strong capital position and a much attentive management might keep it from landing into trouble again.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 7.4% over the past six months against 3.8% rally for the industry it belongs to. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

88,MTB,"Bank stocks have been in the spotlight since the announcement of U.S Presidential election results in November 2016. While the overall financial performance of banks has not been that impressive owing to a tough operating backdrop, the future looks bright.Driven by investors’ interest, price performance of banks has been impressive. Since the Presidential election results, banks have outperformed the Zacks Finance sector.Notably, at the same time, this has made bank stocks a bit expensive. So, should one be betting on the stocks though these are expensive? Well, the answer is a yes.Factors to Keep the Momentum AliveFavorable rate hike scenario: If the Federal Reserve sticks to its plan of increasing rates three times in 2018, it will further help banks in expanding net interest margin. This along with rise in loan demand will eventually drive revenue growth.With the inflation rate improving, there are chances of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed. In fact, the Fed minutes of the January FOMC meeting point in that direction. The report highlighted that improving economic growth, stimulus from the tax cuts and rise in inflation support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.So, banks are anticipated to benefit further.Lower tax rates: All sectors are likely to benefit from the lower tax rates with banks expected to gain the most as they are amongst the highest tax payers in the United States.Also, driven by the tax legislation provisions related to repatriation of overseas cash, banks will be in a win-win situation. This is because, as overseas cash is brought back, it will likely provide an impetus to M&As activities, thereby giving a boost to investment banking. Also, as the act will lower tax rates for wealthy individuals, asset management units of these banks are projected to witness a rise in fund inflow.Potential lesser regulation: Growing investor optimism related to lesser regulations is likely to boost bank stocks. While no time frame has been outlined for the execution, the announcement of a bipartisan agreement has helped investors regain confidence. This will help banks in reducing regulatory compliance costs and will likely to lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry.Upbeat earnings expectations: Earnings for major banks and banks & thrifts are expected to accelerate in 2018 with growth of 22.8% and 27.9%, respectively, compared with 7.5% rise for the Finance sector.Choosing the Winning Bank StocksThe banking industry, as a whole, is likely to gain from the favorable factors. So, it is not an easy task to find the potential winners that will continue witnessing upward momentum.Therefore, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlist stocks that have market capitalization of  more than $1 billion and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

90,MTB,"Investors had a tough time making up their minds about Fed Minutes on Wednesday.  Initially, concerns about a lack of broad-based wage growth allayed ongoing fears that rising inflation would end the markets’ rally. However, things turned around completely during the last 45 minutes of the trading day following a spike in bond yields.Overall, the Fed’s latest report indicates that an increase in economic growth and an uptrend in inflation is reason enough for the central bank to keep raising rates. This was the one clear, unequivocal inflation which came through. Rate hikes will most certainly boost banks higher, which is why adding them to your portfolio looks like a smart option.Pace of Rate Hikes Likely to IncreaseA significant number of the participants of the Fed meeting held between Jan 30-31 said that they had raised their growth projections from the preceding month. Resilient global economic growth, bullish financial markets and the stimulus released by recent tax cuts would propel the economy higher than what is being currently expected.  Others were of the opinion that these same factors had increased “upside risks” for the economy.But the majority of the participants opined that firmer expectations for economic growth have raised the odds in favor of gradual monetary policy tightening. This view was reflected in the manner in which the report’s language was changed to include an indication regarding “further” rate increases.Scanty Evidence on Wage Growth?Members of the U.S. central bank agreed that they have failed to recognize the true impact of recent tax cuts. But there was uncertainty about what impact these cuts would have on wages. Following the tax cuts, several companies have issued bonuses to their employees. But the long term impact of these recent cash transfers remains unclear at this point.Ultimately, the Fed found little evidence up to their meeting about a sector wide increase in wage growth. This part of the report gladdened the hearts of investors initially.However, they were quick to recognize that the Fed’s meeting was closely followed by strong jobs data which reflected a year-over-year pickup in wage growth. Also released almost immediately afterward was strong CPI data which exceeded most expectations.Outlook for Inflation ImprovesOnly a “few” of the 12 districts surveyed by the Federal Reserve observed that companies in those regions had relevant pricing power. Meanwhile, a small section of officials took a dovish stance, arguing that inflation would continue to come in under the Fed target of 2%. They think recent tax cuts would force businesses to engage in a pricing war to capture market share.But the overwhelming majority of officials at the Fed projected that an increase in inflation was likely to ensue. According to the minutes, the index for core personal consumption expenditure or core PCE would increase at a noticeably faster pace this year. This would imply a substantial hike over the 1.5% pace recorded in December.Our ChoicesThe overall tone of the latest Fed meeting minutes indicates that a majority of members favor a gradual step up in rates over the current year. A strong growth environment supportive financial markets and recent tax cuts have pushed up growth projections which in turn have raised the odds for rate hikes.This is why it makes good sense to pick select bank stocks at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is the holding company for M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, National Association.M&T Bank has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

93,MTB,"During the Q4 earnings season, the Finance sector performed well. Despite inflation-related issues and heightening chances of political uncertainty, easing margin pressure, consumer loan growth, tax benefits from the tax reform and controlled expenses helped most banking stocks to perform well. Therefore, we can add some of these stocks to our portfolio based on the robust fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) is one such stock that not only beat estimates in Q4, but has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 moved up 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained 15.9% over the last six months, outperforming 12.5% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, PNC Financial has a number of other aspects that make it an attractive investment option.Why PNC Financial is an Attractive BuyRevenue Growth: PNC Financial continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. The company's fee income has grown at a five-year CAGR (2013-2017) of 1.3%, with marginal fall recorded in 2016. The positive trend continued mainly on rising asset-management revenues and other income. Additionally, in 2017, the company reported a rise in net interest margin (NIM) and net interest income (NII), after witnessing a volatile trend for years since 2009.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 5.15% (as against the industry average of about 4.61%) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 22.18% compared to the S&P 500 average rate of 16.2%. Also, PNC Financial recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 4.13%, over the trailing four quarters.Prudent Expense Management: Though escalation in non-interest expenses was experienced in 2017 on rising personnel and equipment costs, expenses declined at a CAGR of 2.5% over the last five years (2012-2016). Furthermore, the company successfully realized its continuous improvement savings program (CIP) goals for the last three years (ended 2017) of about $1.25 billion. For 2018, management has a CIP target of $250 million.Stock is Undervalued: PNC Financial has P/E and P/B ratios of 14.61 and 1.51 compared to the S&P 500 average of 17.26 and 3.15, respectively. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report). Among these, Comerica and M&T Bank sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while BofA carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Moreover, in the last six months, its shares have gained 24.2%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

94,MTB,"Issues related to past misconducts continue for Wall Street biggie Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). On Friday, Federal Reserve chairperson — Janet Yellen — punished the lender with new sanctions for the recently-revealed malpractices and fake accounts scandal which came into the limelight in September 2016.The Federal Reserve has ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). Notably, Wells Fargo has been instructed to substitute three directors by April, and the fourth by the end of 2018.“We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo requires the firm to improve its governance and risk management processes, including strengthening the effectiveness of oversight by its board of directors,” Janet Yellen said in a statement. “The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers”, she further noted.Therefore, the Fed’s recent action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees. Notably, it is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve, however, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.As a consequence of the consent order which puts a cap on increasing assets, Wells Fargo estimates its profit in 2018 to be cut down by $300-$400 million. Further, the bank will submit a plan within 60 days to the regulators, including the compliance and operational risk management program of improvement. On the Fed’s approval, Wells Fargo will appoint independent third-parties to conduct the review of its processes and submit the results by Sep 30, 2018.It has been more than a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring. The disclosures by Wells Fargo revealed to have identified an additional 1.4 million of fake accounts apart from the 2.1 million accounts reported in September 2016.Currently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past year reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 13.3%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 24.9%. While the current crisis at Wells Fargo will take some time to alleviate, the company’s solid capital position, growing loans and deposits, and improving credit quality position it well for growth. Furthermore, the positive outcome of the recent move is likely to help this San Francisco-based bank regain its customers’ trust.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderJPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

97,MTB,"We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected.

100,MTB,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 19, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. A stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.7%.However, the company’s activities in the fourth quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.05 witnessed a decline of approximately 1% over the last 7 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.7%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.31 billion reflects an improvement of 7% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has also been impressive. Its shares have gained 22.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is +0.81%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Remain Stable: The fourth quarter witnessed modest loan growth. However, the company projects NII to be relatively stable year over year because balance sheet growth will most likely be offset by pressure on net interest margin (NIM). The company expects the fourth quarter NIM to decline in the range of 1-3 basis points.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Refinancing activities increased during the quarter on the expectation of a higher interest rate environment. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Nonetheless, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. Thus, the related fees are projected to increase for SunTrust. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to the overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks are likely to translate into marginal expense reduction. Further, management expects overall expenses in 2017 to decline, given the low-cost employee benefits, along with the benefits of the company’s efficiency initiatives.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It is slated to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18.

102,MTB,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected improve from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s third-quarter 2017 results were hurt by lower trading and mortgage revenues along with higher expenses. The company also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, a decline in provision for loan losses and strong capital position were the tailwinds.The bank has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 16.9%, underperforming 27% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise Is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.45%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 19.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.40.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer front. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The investment banking business witnessed improvement in the quarter and trust income is expected to rise, thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line.However, the overall volume of M&A has remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to decline slightly. Also, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment and hence revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

103,MTB,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp. Rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on KeyCorp’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017. Further, the quarter witnessed growth in its consumer loan portfolio as a result of a rise in consumer confidence.Moreover, President Trump’s success with the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter and is likely to support KeyCorp’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates a 1.9% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were among the positives. However, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Activities of KeyCorp during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 36 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 16.1%.Notably, KeyCorp’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.8% in the past three months, outperforming the 13.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are dim. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.33%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly on the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $966 million, up 1.9% year over year. For 2017, management expects net interest income in the range of $3.8-$3.9 billion.Modest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s fourth-quarter non-interest income will benefit from increasing investment banking income, primarily driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, as the equity markets performed fairly well during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a rise.Nevertheless, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees is likely to be rather muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been constantly diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. As a result of this, we expect the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) to be manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $570 million and non-performing loans of $530 million, reflect a rise of 2.5% each from the last quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

104,MTB,"Year-long efforts to fulfill one of the major promises made by President Trump during elections have finally begun bearing fruits. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax bill on early Saturday morning, which boosted investors’ confidence and led the stock market to rally on Monday.One of the major changes proposed in the tax bill is a significant drop in the corporate tax rate — from 35% to 20%. This is likely to trigger confidence in the markets and spur economic growth by attracting investments from the companies along with increasing jobs.However, the lower income groups are likely to see these changes as a downside. The bill repeals individual mandate in Obamacare, which will leave millions of people uninsured by 2027. Further, people are dubious that the last-minute changes might have left space for the accountants and lawyers to take advantage.Nonetheless, the bill has successfully passed through the second stage and will be presented to a conference committee where representatives from the House and Senate will come together to draft the final bill.A Narrow WinThe Senate was successful in approving the bill by just two votes, with no support from the Democrats.In order to win confidence of some Republicans who were being doubted to vote for the bill, several end-moment changes were made. Yet, one of the Republicans, Senator Bob Corker, stood with the Democrats reflecting his concerns over the burden the proposed bill is likely to create on future generations through increase in public debt.Changes That Helped Get the MajorityHandwritten changes between the lines have been made hastily on the official copy with an aim to get the bill passed through.Some of the major changes are in reference to pass-through businesses like partnerships, popular with real estate developers. Relief was provided by reducing the percentage of tax deduction for such businesses by 2%.Another change was with regard to state and local property tax deductible. The senate took back its previous proposal of ending the deductibility and agreed to make it up to $10,000 as agreed by the House.Further, alternative minimum tax will now be adjusted for individuals and maintained as it is for the corporates, in place of being fully revoked.Why the Hurry?Upon failure of the efforts to repeal Obamacare and delay in fulfillment of promises, Trump was gradually losing confidence of the Americans.With the mid-term elections coming up in 2018, the President sees this tax overhaul as an opportunity to win votes and maintain the majority in the Congress. Thus, he has given his supporters time till the end of 2017, to present the final copy.What Comes Next? Having been amended to win the majority, there are quite some differences in the copies approved by the House and the Senate. Republicans would now sit together and agree upon changes in a conference committee after which the bill would be again presented to both the houses for vote.However, one major rule must be addressed before the bill is passed. A Republican tax bill is allowed to increase the fiscal deficit by $1.5 trillion in the first 10 years only. The Senate backed bill was expected to add $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years.Why Bank Stocks RalliedAll things apart, banks have seemed to come into the spotlight breaking their records, on expectations of higher earnings on the back of lower taxes.In fact, investors’ sentiments have been positive of late due to the to-be Fed Chair, Jerome Powell’s positive remarks on interest rate movement.On Monday, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) gained more than 2%. Further, shares of M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report) and KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) rose nearly 4%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.

However, Moody’s has already taken this into consideration while assigning the ratings.Further, in a year, BankUnited’s loan portfolio witnessed growth of 11% for the period, ending Mar 31, 2018. It was another favorable factor that led to the rating upgrade. Moreover, the bank’s capital profile is expected to remain robust, even after the decline in capital ratios, due to the expansion of its franchise.Additionally, its rapid commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth has also led to a CRE concentration at 2.7 times BankUnited's tangible common equity base as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 3.4 times, which was recorded at the end of 2016.Nevertheless, the rating agency feels that the bank’s funding profile is weaker than other regional US banks.What Can Drive Ratings Up or Down?A further upgrade in ratings is possible if the company’s funding profile improves and funding costs witness a decline. Growth in the commercial banking franchise and robust asset quality can also result in an upgrade.A rating downgrade could occur if the company’s asset quality or profitability deteriorated. Further, ratings can also be downgraded if BankUnited’s concentration risk prominently rises.In the past year, BankUnited’s shares have rallied 25.4%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.8%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

110,MTB,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been embroiled in one scandal after another for more than one and a half years. Troubles have been mounting at Wells Fargo since the revelation of the sales scandal, which was followed by disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business, online bill pay services and the Wealth and Investment Management segment. With the ongoing review process of business practices, more wrongdoings may be reported, consequently straining the top line.The mortgage business of Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed a slowdown in the second quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues will likely have remained low.However, management expects residential mortgage originations to increase in the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q2 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are likely to have improved slightly on a sequential basis during the April-June quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized in the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of collection and funding activities, the bank is positioned to start increasing originations over time, and currently estimates the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.Notably, based on the current pricing trends, management expects production margin to have declined further in second-quarter 2018.Net Interest Income (NII) Growth: NII growth is expected to have been decent, given modest loan and deposit growth, and rising net interest margin on rising rates.According to management, net interest income is predicted to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. It expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might have recorded escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings, during the quarter under review. Moreover, ongoing litigation hassles are expected to have resulted in elevated legal costs. Encouragingly, seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected to have dropped in the quarter, though salary expense is likely to have flared up.Non-Interest Revenues to Disappoint: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely have been recorded on market declines. Growth in trading revenues is predicted to have been muted as uncertainties, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions were not enough to induce volatility. In addition, trust income is likely to disappoint on lower equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP,and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.33%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings remained unchanged over the last seven days, calling for year-over-year growth of 4.7%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $21.6 billion, down 2.7% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 17.

111,MTB,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, driven by consumer banking business and higher equity markets, volatility-driven trading revenues are expected to have remained flat year over year in the second quarter. Though the April-June quarter witnessed uncertainty, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it was insufficient to aid strong trading.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, ""From a trading revenue point of view, at the end of the first quarter, what we've indicated was that we would expect a normal seasonal slowdown in the second quarter. I'd say that, that is exactly what we're seeing right now in the results. That should mean then that we'll basically have flattish trading revenues.""Notably, the equities business is expected to have remained strong in the quarter to be reported, whereas the fixed income business might have experienced a disappointing performance. Further, benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to have offset the negatives.Other Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia in 2018. In U.S.-branded cards, excluding Hilton, continued underlying revenue growth is anticipated as loan balances are maturing as estimated. However, this would be mostly offset by the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect this January. Moreover, the Hilton portfolio sale will likely have a year-over-year impact.Rising card revenues are expected to accelerate growth of overall Latin America Consumer revenues in 2018. Therefore, the to-be-reported quarter results are expected to reflect the trend.Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: Investment banking performance is anticipated to have been flat in the second quarter. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter.Management expects market revenues to go along the overall operating environment. Nevertheless, a seasonal decline in trading revenues is predicted from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues will likely have improved quarter over quarter, assuming favorable market conditions, and continued revenue growth in accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services is anticipated on completion of targets across the global network.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. Nonetheless, some legal settlements during the quarter might have impacted Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might have perked up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to have risen, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG. Net credit-card losses are likely to have worsened. Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points (bps) for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term. In retail services, NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -1.7%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.53 comes in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55.Zacks Rank: Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.55 reflects a 22.1% rise on a year-over-year basis. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $18.5 billion indicates 3.1% growth from the prior-year quarter. Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc.

112,MTB,"Volatility is back in the markets, resulting in higher trading activities. This is expected to benefit Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) first-quarter results, slated to be released on Apr 16, given the significant dependence of its top line on trading revenues.After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, the markets experienced considerable volatility in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates along with lack of specific catalysts were concerns.These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading, while equity trading also didn’t fare better.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Hence, in the to-be-reported quarter, both fixed income trading and equity trading revenues are anticipated to increase.Overall Earnings & Revenue Growth ExpectationsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 59 cents reflects 43.9% surge on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.9 billion indicates a 3% increase from the prior-year quarter.Click here to know about the other factors that are expected influence BofA’s overall results.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteConclusionAmid an improving operating backdrop, rebound in trading revenues is expected to benefit this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s top-line growth.

113,MTB,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to improve from the year-ago quarter.The bank’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improvements in the lending scenario and a rise in consumer confidence were some other positives. Further, heightened volatility during the quarter due to U.S.-China trade war tensions is expected to have boosted the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.42 billion indicates a 4.5% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s fourth-quarter 2017 results were supported by higher revenues along with lower provisions for credit losses. The company also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, rise in expenses was a negative.The bank delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.8%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 27.3%, outperforming 22.1% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.15%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 27.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.74.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent, owing to the tax reform. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost M&T Bank’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The first quarter was exceptionally good for trading activities due to increased volatility, thanks to escalated tariff tensions between the United States and China, rise in prices of necessities and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector. Further, rise in advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher M&A activities and equity issuances are likely to provide some support its top line.However, the debt originations remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to remain muted. Also, with the rising interest rate environment, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter, mortgage banking revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology. Also, M&T Bank witnessed increase in compensation expenses in the first quarter.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been revised nearly 1% upward over the last seven days.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

114,MTB,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.The expected rebound in Citigroup’s trading revenues will likely have a positive impact on first-quarter 2018 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Further, benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to offset the negatives.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter.Therefore, after three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, rising volatility at the very beginning of 2018 is expected to break the trading revenues’ slump. The bank expects first-quarter 2018 trading revenues to be up by a ""low-to-mid"" single digit on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, equities business is likely to record revenues of more than $1 billion in Q1, last recorded in 2015. However, management believes investment banking might go down as compared with the prior-year quarter.Other Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued modest year-over-year revenue growth, and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in 2018. In total, sequential growth in pre-tax earnings in Global Consumer banking was recorded over the last three quarters and is anticipated to continue into the first quarter as well.Acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues is expected in 2018 on rising card revenues.Investment Banking Fees to Decline: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could impact revenues of Citigroup.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks to partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter.On the institutional side, continued year-over-year revenue growth in accrual businesses, including TTS, the Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. Nonetheless, some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to rise, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG, offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Net credit-card losses are likely to worsen. Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points (bps) for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term. In retail services, NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -0.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.60 comes in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62.Zacks Rank: Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.62 reflects a 19.12% rise on a year-over-year basis. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $18.9 billion indicates 4.29% growth from the prior-year quarter. Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc.

115,MTB,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been in the news on a regular basis, following the sales scam that surfaced in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in the bank’s auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.To add to the woes, during the first quarter, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). The Fed’s action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees.Notably, the firm is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve. However, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.Mortgage business, the primary source of revenue for Wells Fargo, is expected to witness a slowdown in the first quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues is expected to be low.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q1 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto-lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, management expects loan growth to be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. Additionally, based on the current pricing trends and channel mix in held-for-sale pipeline, the gain on sale margin is expected to decline.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Moreover, high legal costs might be witnessed due to ongoing litigation hassles.Non-Interest Revenues to Grow Modestly: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely be recorded on market declines. However, driven by high volatility, trading activity is expected to improve marginally in the quarter and rise in trust income is anticipated on higher equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.73%.

116,MTB,"Per a Reuters article, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is likely to face penalty as large as $1 billion due to its wrongdoings in auto insurance and mortgage lending business by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).Brief on the Two FraudsThe San Francisco-based bank has been accused of pocketing commissions from pushing unnecessary auto policies on its customers. Per Wells Fargo's auto insurance policy terms, drivers who have borrowed money from the bank for a new vehicle, are supposed to carry a policy that would pay off the bank in case of a theft or damage. However, the bank’s employees have been blamed of forcing such policies on about 570,000 customers, who were already under coverage. Wells Fargo has blamed the third-party vendor by stating that they wrongly layered insurance policies on its auto borrowers. The bank had investigated the matter thoroughly till 2005 and found that it would have to make refunds of about $145 million to borrowers and adjust account balances by another $37 million.Regarding the mortgage lending probe, Wells Fargo was accused of charging extra fees to customers when their mortgage applications were delayed. The fees in question is rate-lock extension fees, which is supposed to be charged only when borrowers fail to submit documents on time or want to retain the interest rate that initially was quoted for the loan.However, the bank’s officials levied fees on its customers even though the delay was caused by them. Last year, Wells Fargo had announced that it will refund fees to the affected customers, after a review of the matter.CFPB Director’s Motive Behind Such Huge PenaltyCFPB’s acting director, Mick Mulvaney, is seeking to penalize the bank with an aim to duplicate the $100 million penalty that was imposed on it to settle the infamous fake accounts scandal in September 2016. The penalty, so far, is the highest the regulator has levied on a bank.Also, it reiterates President Trump’s opinions on Wells Fargo’s misdeed, which he had voiced through a tweet last December, “Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!”Road Ahead Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal, Wells Fargo has been getting involved in a number of probes. These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated.However, the bank has diligently taken remedial measures and initiatives to keep afloat. Also, lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 4.9% in six month's time versus 5.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward estimate revision of nearly 2% in the last 60 days.

119,MTB,"With a view to trim costs and enhance the quality of customer service, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is making plans to merge corporate and investment banks. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Citing people familiar with the matter, the journal reported that the bank’s restructuring move is likely to result in job cuts in industry coverage, advising, equity and debt capital along with corporate-level relationship managerial positions.Since news of the fake account scandals broke out, a lot of employees at Wells Fargo have been laid off. In July 2017, the company had removed about 70 senior executives from their posts. Some of the employees had moved to lower level positions while some preferred to shift to a new company.Furthermore, in its annual filing, Wells Fargo disclosed that it overcharged customers in its investment and fiduciary services business.  Also, the company said the review process of the Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages”.Due to the review conducted on the bank’s operations and staff level adjustments, some positions of Wells Fargo’s senior and junior level employees across credit sales and trading areas are likely to be affected.

122,MTB,"Benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest-rate scenario have well positioned the banking industry. Moreover, tax overhaul and an expected ease in regulation could bring more benefits.The Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry has rallied 5.6% over the past six months, despite the not-so-impressive earnings results in the last two quarters of 2017. This compares with the S&P 500’s gain of 4.3% and 4.2% rally of the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund (XLF), a top bank ETF, over this period.Therefore, we are focusing on two major banks, M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report) and Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report).M&T Bank, with a market cap of $25.4 billion, offers a wide range of retail and commercial banking services with 780 banking offices in the United States, a commercial banking office in Canada, and an office in the Cayman Islands. On the other hand, Comerica provides various financial products and services in Texas, California, Michigan, Arizona, Florida, Canada and Mexico, and has a market cap of $14.6 billion.Both M&T Bank and Comerica carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

While shares of Comerica have rallied 8.1%, M&T Bank has recorded growth of 5.2%. So, Comerica performed better than M&T Bank.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12-month period is 10.12% for M&T Bank and 10.94% for Comerica as compared with the industry’s level of 10.68%. Therefore, Comerica reinvests its earnings more efficiently.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of M&T Bank has increased slightly over the last 30 days. On the other hand, the same for Comerica inched up nearly 1% for this year, over the same time frame.Moreover, current-year earnings for M&T Bank are projected to jump 30.7% year over year. For Comerica, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.37 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 34.4%.Hence, Comerica reflects better earnings growth prospects.Sales GrowthSales for M&T Bank for the current year are projected to move up 3.4% year over year to $5.8 billion.

Comerica has a current dividend yield of 1.28%, while M&T Bank has a dividend yield of 1.67%.Although both the stocks’ dividend yield is lower than the industry’s average of 2%, shareholders of M&T Bank gain more.Leverage RatioBoth M&T Bank and Comerica have lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 0.91.

123,MTB,"On Wednesday, Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) declined 3.7% following a fall in bond yields, which reached its lowest level since early February. Meanwhile, the sector recovered on Thursday, rising 0.2%, despite fall in key indexes following continued decline in tech stocks. It is quite likely that the recent slump in technology stocks was the reason for the fall in bond yields.This means that Wednesday’s selloff was a reaction to recent market events and not due to fundamentals. In fact, financials gained since the beginning of this year, on optimism surrounding strong economic expansion and steady job growth. Given the Fed’s hawkish stance on rates, investing in financials continues to be a strong option going forward.  Amazon-Led Tech Stock Decline Weighs on Yields?Per Axios, President Trump is somehow “obsessed” with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) as the president is thinking of changing the tech giant’s tax treatment in order to protect the interests of mom-and-pop retailers and other key players. Following this development, shares of Amazon fell 4.4% on Thursday and 7.3% in the last five trading days.Shares of Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) declined 8% and 16.8%, respectively, in the last five trading days. Reuters reported that Nvidia will suspend all its self-driving tests for the time being after a self-sufficient car killed a woman in Arizona. Further, news came out that the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will investigate a fatal crash involving one of Tesla’s vehicles in California.Additionally, Facebook, Inc (FB  -  Free Report) fell 8% in the last five trading days following reports that analytics firm Cambridge Analytica easily collected personal information of more 50 million users without their consent. This raised privacy questions on the social networking giant’s data management and protection from unauthorized third party access.In the absence of other downside risks, it is quite likely that the tech slump weighed on 10-year Treasury bond yields, which fell to 2.77 on Wednesday. Bond yields reached its lowest settlement on Wednesday since Feb 6. Weak bond yields come as dark tidings for financials.However, unlike last year when bond yields fell following the Trump government’s failure to pass any key economic policies and lower inflation, this year’s decline in yields was most likely due to the slump in technology. This means that the decline in financials is not a result of weak fundamental factors, but more a reaction to recent sector specific reverses.Rising Rate Hike Prospects: Boon for FinancialsFollowing its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting held onMar 20-21, the Fed raised its key interest rate by 0.25 points under the Fed’s 16th Chairperson Jerome Powell. The central bank raised its key rate for the sixth time since 2015. Moreover, the Fed also expects two additional rate hikes this year and now three rate hikes in 2019 instead of two. The central bank projects economic growth at the rate of 2.7% in 2018, up from the previous expectation of 2.5%. Further, the growth rate is anticipated to be 2.4% in 2019 — higher than the previous forecast of 2.1%.Rising rate hike chances is good news for financial companies including banks, money managers, insurance firms and brokerage companies. Banks benefit from a steep yield curve, as the spread between long-term and short-term rates widens. This is mainly because the potential rise in rates will enable banks to charge more for loans, leading to an increase in the spread between their lending rates and the rates paid on deposits.Buy These 5 Financial StocksGiven that the recent slump in tech stocks was the likely reason for faltering bond yields, we can say that prospects for financials are largely undiminished. The financial sector performed favorably in recent times following the Fed’s interest rate hikes, better economic growth and Trump’s latest economic policies. In fact, market watchers believe that this rally will continue if rates continue to march higher this year and even in 2019. The Financial Select Sector SPDR has advanced 14.4% in the last one-year period.In this context, we have selected five stocks that are expected to gain following these developments.

124,MTB,"The earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks have performed in the second quarter amid uncertainty related to the trade war fears.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, major bank stocks’ performance lost some steam. The primary reason is the flattening of the yield curve. As such, net interest margin (one of the key metrics for gauging banks’ profitability) is expected to be subdued in the second quarter.Also, growth in trading revenues, which was one of the main supporting factors during the first quarter, is likely to be muted. Though the second quarter witnessed uncertainty mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it wasn’t sufficient.Further, investment banking performance is anticipated to be flat. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities.Dismal mortgage banking performance is also expected to continue in the second quarter amid rising interest rates as mortgage originations and volume declined.Nevertheless, a decent improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer will offer support banks’ interest income while weakness in revolving home equity loans is expected to persist.Further, asset quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings and initiatives to expand into newer areas are expected to result in a slight rise in expenses. But, increase in overall non-operating expenses is likely to be manageable.Further, passage of the new law to lessen banks’ regulatory burden and lower tax rates will support bottom-line growth.Hence, major banks on the S&P 500 Index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness 8.2% year-over-year earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Yet, this compares unfavorably with 25.4% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Picking the Potential WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist.

125,MTB,"While banks are gearing up for the Q2 earnings season, the Federal Reserve has given clean bills of health to majority of the large American banks. Strong jobs numbers, in fact, raised the possibility of further rate hikes which bodes well for banks.The financial sector at large posted its biggest one-day advance in over three months, with banks leading the way. Let us, thus, focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q2 earnings season. Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Dividend BoostSo far this year, bank stocks have been underperforming the broader S&P 500. But bullish investors are optimistic that banks’ discouraging performance will soon come to an end. Banks are planning to bump up dividends after passing the Fed’s latest round of stress tests with flying colors. This, invariably, will provide a boost to share prices of a select number of U.S. banks. The increasing number of dividends is a reflection of tax cut benefits and stronger capital ratios. In fact, greater capital ratios give banks more room to boost shareholder returns.Nine banks, namely Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), BB&T, Regions Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks and US Bancorp, have already planned to increase dividends.(Source: MarketWatch, Data as of July 2)Banks Are UndervaluedBanks’ poor show this year, by the way, may indicate that they are comparatively undervalued compared to the broader equity market. While the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has shed 0.1% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P is up 4%.Bespoke Investment Group macro strategist George Pearkes has in fact found out by using a mathematical model that bank stock prices by utilizing two-year Treasury yields and investment-grade bond spreads as model inputs, are recently priced at 9% below their fair values. Thus, banks have the potential to climb higher.And why not? Solid June employment data has given the Fed a green signal to continue hiking rates. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a healthy sign showing that corporates are finding ways to fill positions despite the lack of skilled workers. Such hiring figures easily topped analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions (read more: Profit From Strong Job Additions With These 5 Top-Ranked Picks).A move toward higher rates is always favorable for banks. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Fed Gets Slightly More HawkishFed, in the meantime, has raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2% last month. The Fed’s dot plot, in fact, indicated that policy makers predict two additional rate hikes this year for a total of four increases instead of three as planned earlier.By the end of this year, the median forecast for the federal funds rate stands at 2.4%, compared with the March forecast of 2.1%. Beyond this year, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee predicts that it will hike rates three times next year and one more time the following year to propel its benchmark rate up to 3.4% (read more: Fed Lifts Rates for the Second Time in 2018: Winners & Losers).4 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q2 EarningsThe aforesaid factors will surely help banks stay afloat this Q2. For the Finance sector, of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor, total Q2 earnings are expected to grow 18.4% from the same period last year on 3.8% higher revenues. This would follow 25.1% earnings growth in the preceding quarter on 4.8% higher revenues (read more: What's Keeping Bank Stocks Down?). This calls for investing in four banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q2 earnings.

127,MTB,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will be reviewing equity capital market transactions at its Australian branch after being accused of misleading potential investors in a block trade transaction that the unit had undertaken in relation to shares of Healthscope Limited in November 2015.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) has put forth concerns over ""certain representations"" that Goldman Sachs Australia made to investors about minimum fixed demand.Goldman Sachs Australia (GS Australia) has been asked to pay $500,000 into a community fund and sign an enforceable undertaking that will require it to tighten controls of its bookbuild messaging of certain transactions.Bookbuild is a process of generating, recording and capturing demand from potential investors for a capital raising transaction.“Certain Representations”GS Australia was appointed as a lead manager and underwriter of a block trade worth A$853 million. Its representatives were noted to have made comments such as “GS Australia had five cornerstone investors and/or that A$500 million of sale shares were covered.” ASIC believes that this led to a misperception of the minimum fixed demand for the sale shares.Also, though the level of demand that was expected to materialize did not occur, the representatives continued to pass above mentioned statements without taking adequate steps to avoid potential misperception.PromisesGS Australia has been able to dodge legal actions by promising to conduct an internal review of policies, procedures, training and supervision of employees engaged in equity capital market transactions led by GS Australia, which involve a bookbuild or underwriting process. The company will also implement changes to address any deficiencies identified.The bank has already undergone initial changes to its controls and processes. Per ASIC, these changes include requiring legal or compliance approval of all bookbuild messages being provided to potential investors in equity capital market transactions and having compliance staff attend sales calls at the launch of deals to have an oversight of messaging to investors.Our TakeGoldman Sachs’ well-diversified business, along with its solid investment banking operations, bolster its financial position. Further, the company’s focus on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, will likely support its overall business growth.However, Goldman’s involvement in a number of investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators have resulted in the stock losing 11.6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Currently, Goldman Sachs carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, customers still have scope for filing a claim if they feel they too have been wronged by the bank.The class-action lawsuit was an outcome of the bank’s undue pressure on its employees to achieve extensive sales targets, which led them to open unauthorized savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit from May 2002 to April 2017.The U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria feels that the settlement is an “imperfect solution”, but there was no alternative. He also said, “Class actions are to some degree rough justice, but I do believe this settlement is fair.”The settlement would entertain claims of those clients who have been charged fees on the accounts that were opened without their consent. Also, refunds would be made to customers whose credit scores have been impacted by Wells Fargo’s improper practice and led to higher borrowing costs for them. Lastly, the remaining amount will be distributed equally among the claimants.Wells Fargo has also been ordered to file some additional paper work that would contain an oversight mechanism to ensure the settlement is fully enforced before its attorneys receive their $21 million share.Since the breakout of scandal in September 2016, Wells Fargo made a lot of changes in its staff levels and practices, yet it continued to be involved in a number of legal issues. Recently, the bank settled a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for $480 million.The Sans Francisco-based bank has been paying a number of penalties on this probe since 2016. With this recently announced settlement, the bank would finally get a chance to move ahead of past misconducts.Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the high cost base. Also, the bank’s efforts to better its image among customers and the improving economic backdrop might support its growth in the near term.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 9.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) current-year earnings estimates have been revised 5.1% upward over the last 60 days.

137,MTB,"During the last earnings season, the Finance sector was one of the best performers. Despite inflation-related issues and rising chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on the banks’ strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects.With organic and inorganic growth strategies, as well as a strong capital position, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. The company’s focus on the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry to tackle macroeconomic headwinds and strategic priorities, including core technology infrastructure, is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.M& T Bank not only beat estimates in Q2, but also has been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2017 and 2018 inched up marginally.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained around 32% over the past year compared with 34.3% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, M&T Bank has a number of other aspects which make it an attractive investment option.Why M&T Bank is a Golden Egg  Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a consistent rise in net interest income. Over the last six years (ended December 2016), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7.7%, with the trend continuing in the first six months of 2017 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 6.3% (as against the industry average of about 6.22%) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 14.7% compared to the industry average rate of 12.6%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 4.66%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The growth has been reflected in the company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the last several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Further, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital deployment activities remain impressive. The company’s 2017 capital plan was approved by the Fed. The plan included share buyback of up to $900 million over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Further, it included a dividend hike on common stock in the range of 5-80 cents per share to be provided in second-quarter 2018.

139,MTB,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is well poised for future growth, given its global network, wide range of innovative products and services, and sturdy capital position. Also, easing margin pressure is expected to aid top-line improvement.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has moved 3.6% upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).State Street’s share price has increased 23.2% so far this year, outperforming the 6.3% rally for the industry it belongs to. Given the positive estimate revisions and a solid Zacks Rank, the stock should gain further.Looking at the fundamentals, State Street’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 1.5% over the past five years (2012–2016), primarily driven by higher management fees and securities finance income. Moreover, revenues are expected to continue rising, given the company’s continued investment in new products and the acquisition of GE Asset Management.Also, with the economic recovery and the gradual change in rate environment, pressure on State Street’s net interest margin (NIM) seems to be easing. Given the optimistic view on future rate hikes, the company’s margin is expected to improve further, thereby supporting top-line growth.Further, given a stable capital position and impressive earnings strength, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, continuously rising expenses remains a major concern for the company. Expenses have increased at a five-year (2012–2016) CAGR of 4.1%, primarily due to a rise in compensation, and acquisition and restructuring costs. Elevated expenses are likely to curb bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead.A few other top-ranked stocks from the finance space are mentioned below.The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 13.2% for the current fiscal year over the past 60 days.

140,MTB,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) recently made an undisclosed investment in Bill.com, the largest business-to-business (B2B) payments network in the U.S. The move is part of the company’s efforts toward enabling its business clients do away with paper checks, and instead make and receive payments electronically.Bill.com’s technology is likely to be integrated into JPMorgan’s digital system by early 2018. The association will benefit the banks’ customers by allowing them to have access to Bill.com’s network comprising almost 2.5 million users.Notably, according to Stephen Markwell, a product strategy head for JPMorgan, though various customers have started making use of electronic payment tools, there is still a huge amount of business payments that are made using checks. In fact, around $4 is spent by companies for printing and handling each check.Hence, once businesses start making and receiving payments electronically, it will save a lot of their time, money and effort, which goes into managing bills manually.Markwell says, “Bill payment is a huge source of pain for businesses,” adding, “Every step of that process is manual, inefficient, error-prone, and ripe for electronification.”However, this is not the first time that JPMorgan is using the expertise of another firm to better serve its clients. In order to make auto purchases easier and to simplify small business lending and mortgage origination, the bank had in the past announced partnerships with firms like Truecar, On Deck Capital Inc. and Roostify.The company’s price performance looks impressive.

However, increasing cost base remains a woe.M&T Bank’s net interest income has been rising consistently, recording a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7.7% over the last six years (ended 2016). Reduced margin pressure on the back of rate hikes will also benefit the bank.  M&T Bank continues to enhance shareholders’ value through steady capital deployment activities. It raised the common stock dividend by 7% in February 2017 and plans another hike in second-quarter 2018 in the range of 5 cents to 80 cents per share. The bank also has a share repurchase program of up to $900 million underway. These activities look impressive due to M&T Bank’s favorable debt/equity ratio when compared to the broader industry.However, M&T Bank’s consistently rising cost base remains a major concern. Expenses witnessed a CAGR of 5.4% over the last five years (ended 2016). The bank’s ongoing investments in technology and operational infrastructure are likely to keep expenses under pressure.Shares of M&T Bank have gained 28.6% over the past year, at par with the industry.M&T Bank’s activities during the year were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

143,MTB,"People's United Financial Inc.’s (PBCT  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 operating earnings of 24 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure was up 4% year over year.Higher revenues and lower provisions primarily led to the earnings growth. Growth in loans and deposit further supported the results.

Further, net interest margin improved 9 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.90%.Non-interest income climbed 7.3% year over year to $91.6 million. The rise was primarily attributable to higher investment management fees, commercial banking lending fees, operating lease income and insurance revenue.Non-interest expenses increased 21% on a year-over-year basis to $257.3 million. Rise in compensation and benefits, professional and outside services, regulatory assessments and other non-interest expenses were the main factors responsible for the significant increase in expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $31.6 billion, up 6.4% from the prior quarter. Further, total deposits increased approximately 4.3% to $31.8 billion from the prior quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $198.1 million, up 8.8% year over year.

Furthermore, the company is steadily growing through acquisitions, which is likely to continue in the near future, given its strong balance sheet position. Also, a likely ease of regulatory restrictions might bring down costs on this front.However, margin pressure and rising non-interest expenses are expected to restrict bottom-line expansion in the upcoming quarters. People's United Financial, Inc.

145,MTB,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.4% in second-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and decline in profitability ratios were the undermining factors.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 3.26%.People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 2.7% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 4.7% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.28%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. In addition, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

146,MTB,"The earnings season had a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far. Though the results have not been able to impress investors markedly, hopes are high that the industry will soon regain momentum.The banks that released earnings reported higher revenues supported by improved loan balances and higher interest rates. However, lower mortgage and trading revenues impacted the fee income to some extent.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, earnings for the major banks, accounting for nearly one-third of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500, are up 7.2% from the prior-year quarter while revenues are 1.9% higher.Earnings releases are coming in thick with U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Oct 18, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these three Major Regional Banks when they report third-quarter earnings.U.S. Bancorp is expected to report year-over-year improvement in revenues supported by higher net interest income (NII) on the back of loan growth. Some support is expected from the Mortgage Banking business as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Bancorp’s current-quarter earnings of 88 cents reflects a 4.5% rise year over year.However, the bank’s aim to be technologically advanced should keep costs high.

Rise in loans along with favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s NII.

147,MTB,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because M&T Bank is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MTB in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.41 per share for MTB, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.40 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MTB, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.33% heading into earnings season.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MTB has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

148,MTB,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to show improvement from the year-ago quarter.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. Results benefitted from an improvement in revenues. However, deteriorating credit quality was a major headwind.Also, M&T Bank has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.7%.However, activities of the company in the third quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.40 has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 12.8%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.43 billion reflects an improvement of 5.7% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s strong fundamentals have helped its shares gain 43.2% in the past year, outperforming the 38.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill this price performance continue post Q3 earnings? Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients – positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Relatively Stable Fee Income: Since the overall volume of M&A and equity issuance has remained low during the quarter, the related fees are expected to decline slightly. Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenue is not expected to witness much improvement.Nevertheless, as the overall equity markets witnessed some improvement in the quarter, trust income is expected to rise, thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

149,MTB,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 17, are expected to show a decline in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the negative impact on earnings.    Similar to the prior quarter, slump in fixed-income trading revenues is expected to be the main reason for the decline in trading revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.18 billion reflect a decline of 5.1% sequentially and 20.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.88 billion indicates a decrease of 12.7% from the prior quarter. However, equity trading revenues are expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis.The decline in trading revenues is largely attributable to higher-than-usual volatility (due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U.S. presidential election) in the year-ago quarter. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Absence of any concrete development on the proposed financial reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the primary reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter.Overall, Q3 trading revenue is expected to be $2.86 billion, down 10.3% from the last quarter and 9.8% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s Q3 results:Underwriting fees to rise: Though equity underwriting volumes in the third quarter were low owing to seasonality, this is not likely to have any significant impact on Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting market share, given its strong global presence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $297 million reflects a jump of 25.8% from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this has been leading to strong gains for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $395 million reflects year-over-year growth of 8.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees is projected to witness a 15.3% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $692 million.Stable advisory fees: With the overall improvement in global M&A scenario during the third quarter, Morgan Stanley should be able to generate decent advisory fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $502 million, relatively stable year over year.Net interest income (NII) to increase marginally: Improvement in demand for loans — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 81 cents reflects a 1.3% improvement on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $9 billion indicate a marginal growth from the prior-year quarter.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Oct 17.

151,MTB,"The Q3 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the results of banks that have been in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.While investors’ optimism over the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep raising interest rates should drive bank stocks higher in the upcoming months, Q3 results are not expected to be overwhelming.This is because, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector's total earnings) are expected to witness 5.1% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares with 10% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Reduction in equity issuance, feeble equity trading volumes and subdued volumes of M&A’s are expected to negatively impact fee income growth for banks this time around. However, a persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) and stability of fixed income trading flows will likely provide some respite.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer might energize interest income for banks.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are unlikely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s second-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and decline in provision for loan losses.

Over the last three months, shares of PNC Financial have gained 7.5% compared with 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 5.1%. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Provision for loan losses in the year-ago quarter was $87 million.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

153,MTB,"Pennsylvania attorney general, Josh Shapiro, has filed a lawsuit against Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report), accusing the company of engaging in deceptive lending practices, which have cost billions of dollars to borrowers. Following the news, shares of Navient fell nearly 14.3%.Navient, which was once a part of Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report), has now become the largest provider of student loans in the United States. The company services more than $300 billion in student loans to more than 12 million customers.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, relates to the time period mainly between 2004 and 2014. During that time, the company was engaged in making predatory loans to college students with poor credit. These students attended colleges with a very low graduation rate, which increased their possibility of not being able to complete their degrees. Ultimately, the borrowers were not being able to repay their loans.Further, there were claims that the company expanded subprime loan offerings that were at greater risk of default.Shapiro said, “Navient's deceptive practices and predatory conduct harmed student borrowers and put their own profits ahead of the interests of millions of families across our country who are struggling to repay student loans.”Per Shapiro’s statement, Pennsylvania residents have already filed more than 1,000 complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) against the company.This is not the first time that Navient has been accused of making abusive loans to customers. Earlier in January, the CFPB had sued Navient, claiming that the company had “cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans.”Moreover, the states of Illinois and Washington too had sued the company earlier on similar charges.Shapiro claimed, “The more businesses like Navient put their bottom line ahead of the interests of their customers and consumers, the more vigilant we will be to protect Pennsylvanians and hold businesses like Navient accountable for their misconduct.”Notably, Navient has been asked to provide full restitution to the borrowers who have been affected by its alleged misconduct. Shapiro has also asked the company to disgorge the profits that it earned through unlawful means.However, the company has not yet accepted any of the charges against it. The company said, “The allegations are completely unfounded and the case was filed without any review of Pennsylvania residents' customer accounts. We comply with the rules that govern the student loan program as set by Congress and the U.S. Department of Education, and there are no allegations that we have violated these rules.”Navient continues to struggle with several litigation issues amid the heightened regulatory scrutiny over alleged anti-consumer practices in the U.S. student loan industry.Shares of the company have lost 13.4% over the past year, compared with 18.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report) and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report).Toronto-Dominion Bank has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 11.2% for the current fiscal year over the past 60 days.

154,MTB,"Wilmington-based Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) has entered into a cash-acquisition deal with San Francisco-based Earnest, a financial technology company, under which the former will acquire the latter for a total value of $155 million. In this era of digitization, the combined entity will serve consumer-centric education credit products.The deal awaits certain customary approvals. Moreover, the transaction is anticipated to close in fourth-quarter 2017.“Combining Earnest’s best-in-class data science, digital marketing, and technology with Navient’s industry and capital markets experience create an exciting platform to deliver value for consumers and investors,” said Jack Remondi, president and CEO, Navient.Terms of the DealPer the deal, the remaining share repurchase program of Navient will be suspended till the end of 2018, though the annual dividend of 64 cents remains in place. Notably, the capital will be invested toward growth of the education-lending business and building book value.Earnest is a financial technology and education finance company serving consumers unable to get finance from traditional banks. Initiated in 2013, the company is likely to serve with loans worth $1 billion in student loan refinancing loans in 2017.Notably, post acquisition, the brand — Earnest — would continue as before, headed by its current management team. In addition, clients of Earnest will be served with the same rates, terms and benefits they are entitled to.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), served as a financial advisor to Navient, while Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report) acted as the financial advisor for Earnest.Bottom LineWe believe the latest acquisition is a befitting one that will likely support Navient’s future prospects, which faces potential threat from lack of access to new loans and alternative sources of revenues. The company’s focus on tapping growth opportunities is anticipated to boost its overall business performance. Further, a gradually improving economy and declining unemployment rate are expected to provide support to the company.Notably, the company's share price rose nearly 1% over the last six months, as compared with 6.8% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, Navient carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

160,MTB,"At a heated senator meeting held on Tuesday, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan vigorously tried to defend America’s third-largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators.Sloan was grilled for forcing the affected customers of fake accounts scandal into arbitration in order to avoid courtroom experience. He responded by saying that the bank has not prevented its customers from suing and would not do so in the future either.The senators charged Wells Fargo of hiding the problems in auto insurance business in the meeting that was held last year regarding the fake accounts that had been created.Further, in a follow-up after the hearing, the committee had asked whether there was any evidence of other fraudulent activity in the bank or discovery of any misconduct. To this, the bank reported only about certain employees in the community banking division and did not disclose the auto insurance scandal, which had come to light in July 2016.Sloan defended himself by saying that he got the insurance program suspended in September 2016 after he came to know about the problems.While one of the democrats suggested regulators to consider revoking the bank's charter and shutting it down completely, the other suggested Wells Fargo’s CEO to be fired.Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and has promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come.Further, Sloan also disclosed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is investigating fees charged from customers to extend interest rate lock periods for mortgages. He also revealed that the bank plans to contact over 108,000 customers to address complaints about fees charged to lock in mortgage rates.The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance.

171,MTB,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has been rated down to AA (low) from AA by DBRS, a Toronto-based credit rating agency. Its involvement in fake-account scandal has majorly led to this rating downgrade.The downward rating reflects Wells Fargo’s operational inefficiency and improper management. The rating agency also took into account the bank’s falling reputation because of the several legal issues that have come to light of late.Further, DBRS also considered the amount of expenses the bank has already incurred and would be facing in the near term.Wells Fargo has already agreed to pay $142 million in settlement of class-action suit for opening accounts without its customers’ permission. Also, it paid refunds of about $3.7 million to its customers through July 2017.However, this was not the end for Wells Fargo’s troubles. Some more disclosures regarding problems in other consumer-related products were made.The bank had been accused of charging high termination fees and unauthorized credit card fees along with issues in its auto insurance business in August 2017. Later, news of Wells Fargo closing authentic bank accounts without permission was reported. Moreover, as a result of an expanded review, the bank revealed that another 1.4 million fake accounts were created by its employees illegally. It has agreed to pay another $2.8 million as refunds to customers.The regulators are yet to take actions against the bank. Recently, the Fed Chair Janet Yellen called Wells Fargo’s actions ""egregious and unacceptable"" and disclosed that the Fed is trying to understand the main reasons for these problems.DBRS’ rating still keeps Wells Fargo among the highest-rated banks because of its diversified franchise and strong capital position. However, the rating agency disclosed that higher-than- expected litigation costs are leading to reduced profits. In fact, any further asset quality deterioration would lead to a negative rating.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 17.6% over the past year, underperforming the 36.4% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report) and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report).

173,MTB,"On Friday, as part of a settlement reached with regulators, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) agreed to refund $335 million to its credit card customers holding 1.75 million customer accounts, after having confessed to charging higher interest rates to some of the defaulters, since 2011. Notably, the banking giant was not charged additional fine by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), as the bank itself identified the issue and reported to CFPB in 2017.Per Citigroup, the refunds averaged around $190 and the refund process will likely be completed by the end of this year. ""Citi is pleased to have resolved the matter with the Bureau, and we reiterate our sincere apologies to our customers for not correcting these issues sooner,” the bank noted.BackgroundPer the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, credit card issuing companies are required to review accounts of customers whose interest rates had risen after a missed payment or bounced checks. The companies are to determine whether the customer has resumed making timely payments or has displayed some other creditworthy behavior. On being satisfied of the customer’s financial standing, the rates are supposed to be lowered.In one such review, it was revealed that Citigroup had kept overcharging about 1.75 million accounts. A number of flaws were discovered in the methodology which was used to calculate the reduced rates in some accounts.Further, majority of the affected accounts witnessed smaller rate cuts than they were eligible to, while the rest did not get the reduction at all. Also, the bank had reported to have found no wrongdoings on part of its employees.Previously in 2015, financial regulators had made Citigroup pay nearly $700 million to credit card customers who were made to buy unnecessary add-on services.ConclusionBanks across the globe have been facing increasing scrutiny for their business practices. Many of these firms have paid billions of dollars as fines and compensation to settle lawsuits and probes. Many investors have lost their hard-earned money as a result of such business malpractices. Encouragingly, such settlements help restore investors’ confidence in banks and their operations.Shares of Citigroup have lost around 10.3% over the past six months compared with the nearly 6% decline recorded by the industry.

174,MTB,"A lawsuit has been filed against Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) alleging it to have encouraged retailers to include hidden fees in the selling price, using the bank’s financing programs. The news was reported by Reuters.The case has been filed by El Paso, TX-based J Edwards Jewelry Distributing and its president, John Silverman, on behalf of more than 5,000 retailers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.Per the complaint, Wells Fargo made the retailers advertise that customers could purchase their products with the benefit of interest-free finance programs, when in fact, the prices were already inflated with a double-digit interest charge.Wells Fargo has been accused of violating the U.S. Truth in Lending Act, under which, lenders are supposed to disclose in details the financing charges.Wells Fargo’s finance programs — Wells Fargo Jewelry Advantage and Wells Fargo Home Projects — were advertised at the stores and websites of retailers. However, the bank had full control of what these advertisements would contain.Moreover, the lawsuit claims that Wells Fargo pockets nearly $800 million yearly through these hidden charges, whereas, the retailers had to pay higher sales taxes to local governments compared to what they would have paid in absence of these programs.In the first half of 2018, Wells Fargo remained busy with settling past legal hassles while problems in new areas of operations came in focus. It also underwent restructuring of unprofitable divisions along with facing limitations on asset growth by regulators.However, the Wall Street biggie proved its potential by clearing both tough levels of Feds stress test.

176,MTB,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

177,MTB,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) can be a solid bet now on the back of its focus on revenue-enhancing initiatives which will likely drive operational efficiency. Further, the company is expected to benefit from a strong capital position, easing margin pressure and loan growth in the near term.Growth in Efficiency and Revenue Initiative or “GEAR Up” initiatives, rising rates, steady fee income and robust capital-deployment activities continue to drive Comerica’s performance. However, escalating expenses on technological developments remain concerns.The company recorded a gain 4.8% over the past six months compared with 5.3% decline recorded by the industry.Further, the company’s earnings estimates moved around 1% upward, for the current year, over the past 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In mid-2016, Comerica launched “GEAR Up” initiatives in order to drive revenue growth, and reduce expenses by identifying and analyzing areas with room for improvement. Notably, execution of these initiatives resulted in increased pre-tax income of 25% in first-quarter 2018. Further, such initiatives are anticipated to deliver annual pre-tax income of about $270 million by year-end 2018, and additional benefits in pre-tax income of $35 million in 2019 and beyond.Moreover, the company remains well poised to benefit from the rising rate environment. The consistently increasing loans balance over the past years has supported margin expansion to an extent. Management expects average loan growth to be in line with Gross Domestic Product growth in 2018.Comerica continues to enhance shareholders’ value through steady capital-deployment activities. The successful clearance of the Fed stress test in 2018 indicates that Comerica is well positioned to weather any severe economic downturn. Furthermore, it awaits regulatory approvals for rewarding shareholders with dividends or potential share buybacks under the 2018 capital plan.However, volatile non-interest expenses remain a concern. Additionally, management expects expenses to flare up 1% in 2018, as it continues to invest in technological developments.

178,MTB,"On Jun 26, we issued an updated research report on BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report). The company exhibits strength in several areas including loans and deposits, and capital position. Also, its inorganic growth strategies are anticipated to yield positive results. However, it continues to face challenges from an increasing expense base.Shares of the company have gained 17.6% in a year’s time, outperforming 6.2% growth of the industry  it belongs to.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has been revised slightly upward over the last 30 days. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).BOK Financial has significantly bolstered its growth prospects over the years through strategic acquisitions. Recently, the company announced that it is merging with Denver-based CoBiz Financial, strengthening its foothold in Colorado and Arizona. BOK Financial expects the deal to be 6% accretive to earnings in 2019 and 9% in 2020. Moreover, its involvement in such inorganic growth activities reflects its strong capital position.Consistent improvement in its loan and deposit balances highlights BOK Financial’s organic growth. For full-year 2018, the company expects mid-single digit loan growth. Apart from rising loan balances, pressure on the company’s net interest margin has been easing due to the Fed interest rates hikes. This has also benefited BOK Financial’s top line.  However, the company faces operational risks from escalating costs. Operating expenses saw a CAGR of 5.1% over the last five years (ended 2017). This trend continued in first-quarter 2018 as well. Such consistent rise in expenses despite its focus on expense management is likely to deter bottom-line growth.Though BOK Financial has been announcing dividend hikes every year, its debt/equity ratio seems unfavorable compared with the broader industry. Further, the company’s performance in the past few quarters has been quite fluctuating. Hence, we believe that these capital deployment activities might not be sustainable.Stocks to ConsiderLuther Burbank Corporation's (LBC  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 was revised 6.4% upward, in the last 60 days.

179,MTB,"As part of its efforts to reorganize the investment banking operations in China, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The target is expected to be achieved within the next two to three years.This move by the bank, to expand its China investment-banking operations, comes as it seeks to increase focus on technology companies, with an investment-banking coverage in the country. Recently, there is an increasing number of Chinese technology companies that are well positioned to be valued at hundreds of billions of dollars in a few years and hence, are engaged in fundraising through public and private markets.John Hall, co-head of JPMorgan’s investment banking coverage for the Asia Pacific said that the investment-banking industry groups that traditionally existed do not match up to the new-economy technology companies in China.Murli Maiya, another co-head of JPMorgan’s investment banking for the Asia Pacific stated, “China is the country that just has leapfrogged, surpassing many things that happened in the West for the last decade.”Maiya added, “The new economy in China is newer than and very different from many economies anywhere in the West.”Hence, in order to cater to such new technology companies, JPMorgan is changing the structure of its investment banking team in China. It is trying to reorganize and modify the categorization of its banking team.In the past few weeks, it has created nearly seven new groups, which are reinforced by the fast-growing technology sector.Notably, JPMorgan has also been planning to launch a joint-venture brokerage firm in China.

181,MTB,"The Federal Reserve released the first round of its annual stress test results, mandated by the Dodd-Frank regulation. The findings showed that the 35 largest U.S. banks are well positioned to put more money in dividends, share buybacks and business investments. The banks have sufficient capital balance to withstand severe recession.The results have been announced at a time when the Fed is forging ahead with rate hikes, reflecting an economy that is improving by the day. Banking on such positive developments, investing in sound bank stocks that have passed the litmus test will be judicious.What Are the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests?The Fed started testing banks in 2009, two years after the beginning of the financial crisis that resulted in a recession. The Fed had to test all U.S. bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, per the Dodd-Frank law enacted by former president Obama in 2010.But the threshold was raised to $100 billion last month by President Trump. These banks are subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) that determines whether they can fund dividend payments and share buybacks amid economic turmoil.   Banks Clear First Round of Fed’s Toughest Annual Stress TestsAll 35 banks that underwent the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests showed that they have enough capital buffers to weather an economic meltdown and recessions modelled by the Fed. These banks can withstand a situation where unemployment rate rises to 10%, an almost 6% increase from the current level; the stock market tanks by two-thirds and home prices plunge by 30%.Banks’ capital scores remained comfortably above regulatory requirements in the first round of the stress tests, even though they had to bear losses due to higher credit card balances and one-time accounting challenges enacted by the recent congressional overhaul.Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles added that “despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession”.Banks Are Well Poised to Meet Financial ObligationsAll 35 banks stayed above the 4.5% minimum capital ratio in a severely stressed situation. When it comes to assessing the ability of a bank to meets its financial obligations, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) 5.3% capital ratio turned out to be the lowest, per Fed. Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report) topped the list with 17.6%, followed by UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Banco Santander, S.A. (SAN  -  Free Report) at 16.4% and 15.2%, respectively.The diagram shows all the 35 banks that have cleared the minimum capital ratio to satisfy the Fed’s concern. Fed Rate Hikes Bode Well for BanksWhile the stress test showed that the banks could withstand a downturn, it came at a time when the Fed lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signaled a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy gained strength and inflation crawled higher.The Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage points to a range of 1.75% to 2% this month and predicted two additional rate hikes this year. This will take the count to four increases instead of three as planned earlier.Needless to say, higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.5 Biggest GainersGiven the positive trends, we have selected five solid banks that have passed the first round of the stress test.
