2,CAH,"Shares of F5 Networks (FFIV), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Lam Research (LRCX), Mattel (MAT) and McKesson (MCK) fell late Wednesday on earnings reports.F5 is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs), electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers.Fiscal Q1 earnings rose 14% to $1.98 a share, topping forecasts by 4 cents. Sales climbed 5% to $516 million but missed views for $517 million. F5 gave Q2 guidance in line with Wall Street targets.Shares fell 4.6% to 139 in late trading.

F5 hit a record high of 148.34 on Dec. 21.Citrix is a leader in virtualization software to boost server performance. It's a software rival to F5's hardware.Citrix earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million.The company sees 2017 non-GAAP EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but it's not clear if the numbers are comparable. Citrix's guidance excludes GoToMeeting, which is merging with LogMeIn (LOGM).The company also hiked its buyback plan by $500 million.But shares fell 4.3% to 91.60 in late trading.

"
3,CAH,"Cardinal Health (CAH) on Monday lowered its full-year forecast due to smaller margins in its key pharmaceutical sector, but reported fiscal first-quarter profit that came in ahead of analyst estimates and restored some order to the drug wholesale sector.Shares of the Dublin, Ohio-based company rose 1.8% to 68.69 in the wake of a near double-digit sell-off on Friday, wrought by lower-than-expected earnings from rival McKesson (MCK). McKesson ended Friday's carnage down nearly 23%, and tried to mount a comeback Monday, rising 2.5% to 127.17.The third company in the drug-distribution power triumvirate, AmerisourceBergen (ABC), also got caught up in the sell-off swirl and lost more than 13% on Friday. On Monday, shares climbed 1.7% to 70.32. AmerisourceBergen plans to release earnings on Wednesday.""On the heels of McKesson's challenging 2Q last week, Cardinal's results were downright boring (thankfully),"" EvercoreISI analyst Ross Muken said in a note to clients, adding the parenthetical phrase. ""While pharma distribution missed our EBIT forecast and is expected to be weaker than originally anticipated in 2Q and for the FY, the magnitude of the cut is not as 'frightening.' ""Cardinal Health said quarterly income was $309 million. Adjusted earnings were $1.24 per share, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.21 per share.The prescription drug distributor posted revenue of $32.04 billion in the period, ahead of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks who expected $31.22 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares took a severe drubbing on Friday, gapping down drastically on competitive concerns expressed by rival drug distributor McKesson. Further, shares had been trending down since reaching an intraday high of 91.91 in April 2015. The bright side? Of the three major drug wholesalers, Cardinal's drop on Friday was the least drastic: just under 10%.Cardinal, however, lowered its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, down from its previous guidance of $5.48 to $5.73. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected full-year EPS of $5.59, near the top end of Cardinal's new range.""The company states the segment is impacted by generic pharma pricing as the more significant factor unfavorably impacting the segment followed by reduced levels of branded price inflation, but is unclear on the competitive environment,"" Citi analyst Garen Sarafian said in a note to clients.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
"
4,CAH,"Shares of drug-distribution giant McKesson (MCK) went into free fall Friday morning, dragging its two main rivals with it, after it reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that were well short of analyst estimates and drastically lowered its full-year forecast.McKesson stock tumbled by nearly 29% at one point, and ended the day down 22.7% to end the session at 124.11. Its chief rivals in the drug distribution business, Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) both were down by double digits. Cardinal finished the day down 9.8% to 67.50 a share and AmerisourceBergen plunged 13% to 69.14.A note from Citi Research analyst Garen Sarafian said McKesson was blaming AmerisourceBergen for much of its troubles, saying AmerisourceBergen had made a move to shore up more business from independent pharmacies.""While we have no reason to refute (McKesson) management we respect, we find it extremely odd that peer raised through the ranks of the company's conservative culture for nearly a quarter-century would choose to compete so aggressively as to create such a large impact on (McKesson),"" Sarafian wrote.San Francisco-based McKesson said adjusted net income was $2.94 per share, while the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.05 per share. The prescription drug distributor posted revenue of $49.96 billion in the period, which also did not meet Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $51.43 billion.IBD'S TAKE: McKesson stock had long been reliable, climbing steadily to an intraday peak of 243.61 in May 2015, but has plunged since then. Friday's stock plummet puts it at half of its peak value. It now ranks third in IBD's medical and wholesale drug supplier group, with AmerisourceBergen now at the top.McKesson lowered its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $12.35 to $12.85 per share. Estimates from Thomson Reuters had called for earnings of $13.59 a share.With Friday's tumble McKesson shares have fallen nearly 40% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased slightly more than 4%.McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have a virtual stranglehold on the drug distribution market, collectively controlling well over 90%. McKesson is the biggest of the three, with annual revenue of more than $180 billion, putting it in the fifth spot on the Fortune 500 list. AmerisourceBergen is 12th with more than $135 billion and Cardinal is 21st at more than $102 billion.All three, however, exist on razor-thin margins that often are 1% or less. McKesson's $307 million in net income is 0.6% of its nearly $50 billion in revenue for the quarter.
"
5,CAH,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.

6,CAH,"Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Mylan (MYL), Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP), Lannett (LCI) and other generic-drug makers tumbled Thursday afternoon after Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion, with charges likely by year-end.The DOJ is probing more than a dozen generic-drug makers over whether they colluded on pricing, according to Bloomberg.Mylan issued the following statement: ""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation.  To date,  we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Teva Pharmaceuticals has disclosed subpoenas and is cooperating, Bloomberg added. Lannett also has received a subpoena, the Wall Street Journal said.The antitrust probe is about two years old and covers some two dozen drugs, Bloomberg said, citing sources. A grand jury is examining if executives agreed to raise prices.Teva shares plunged 9.6% to 39.17 on the stock market today, falling to its lowest levels since November 2013. Mylan lost 6.7%. Lannett crashed 26.6%, Endo Pharmaceuticals 19.5% and Akorn (AKRX) 18.1%. Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) fell 7.3%.The DOJ collusion probe news is the latest sign that the drug industry face increasing regulatory and political pressure over prices. Hillary Clinton has vowed to crack down on drug prices, while her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has hit specific drug stocks with negative tweets.And the latest report hit more than just drugmakers. CVS Health (CVS), drug store giant and pharmacy benefit manager, lost 2.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.7%.Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), McKesson (MCK) and Cardinal Health (CAH) all fell nearly 5%. And that followed huge losses for all three on Oct. 28, when McKesson missed and warned, citing competitive pressure on prices. McKesson lost nearly 23% that day, with Cardinal down nearly 10% and AmerisourceBergen 13%.Diplomat Pharmacy (DPLO) crashed 42% after a huge Q3 miss late Wednesday amid price concessions and lower demand for hepatitis C drugs.

Facebook was up 2% in some of the most active trading in today's market.

Its quarterly results missed estimates and the drug distributor sharply cut its full-year forecast amid pricing pressures. Peer Cardinal Health (CAH) plunged in sympathy, falling 11.5% to the lowest level since May 2014. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) plunged 13%.The damage spread beyond the drug distribution industry. Generic drugs, biotech, managed care and medical services were some health care industry groups down more than 1% and in the bottom rungs of Friday's performance table.AbbVie (ABBV) gapped down sharply in volume more than 4 1/2 times the average as earnings topped views but sales missed analyst targets.Novo Nordisk (NVO) gapped to the lowest level since November 2013, accelerating a price deterioration that started in August. The drugmaker missed sales estimates and cited declining sales and prices for insulin.RELATED:Q3 Bottom Line: Google A Cash Machine, Amazon A Free SpenderEllie Mae Has Inside Track To Help Mortgage Lenders Go Digital McKesson Drags Down Sector With Earnings Miss, Lower OutlookAbbVie Topples On Humira Miss; Sanofi, Novo Diverge On Insulin Panic

9,CAH,"Stocks were mixed Friday morning as investors digested the Commerce Department's positive read on third-quarter GDP growth and several big earnings reportsDow industrials remained slightly higher while the S&P 500 fell fractionally and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.Big-boned earnings reports powered early action on the stock market today. One exception was Baker Hughes (BHI).

10,CAH,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress.

Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC).

"
37,CAH,"Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies. Under that deal, which runs through March 2019, McKesson assumed responsibility for sourcing both branded and generic medications.

"
39,CAH,"The agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.
"
40,CAH,"McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.
"
41,CAH,"The Rite Aid partnership provides McKesson massive scale and purchasing power, analysts say. This in turn gives it both sales volume and pricing advantages, enabling it to grow revenue and maintain favorable profit margins.
"
42,CAH,"""McKesson is one of the best-positioned firms in the health care industry,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told IBD. ""They've been a very good performer.""

However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.

"
48,CAH,"""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.
"
49,CAH,"Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""
"
50,CAH,"It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.
"
51,CAH,"On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.
"
52,CAH,"Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.
"
53,CAH,"The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.
"
54,CAH,"Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.
"
55,CAH,"The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.

61,CAH,"Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.
"
62,CAH,"This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.
"
63,CAH,"""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.
"
64,CAH,"Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.
"
65,CAH,"As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.
"
66,CAH,"All of that points to sales growth for prominent prescription-drug distributors such as McKesson, which Lekraj says ""should be one of the better beneficiaries of the trends in health care overall.""With seven straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth, prescription drug and medical supplies distributor McKesson is in its strongest financial run in years.The company should continue generating robust sales, thanks to a key retail partnership and favorable secular trends in health care, including increasing demand for medications from an aging baby boomer generation.McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies. Under that deal, which runs through March 2019, McKesson assumed responsibility for sourcing both branded and generic medications.Top-Line LiftThe agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.The Rite Aid partnership provides McKesson massive scale and purchasing power, analysts say. This in turn gives it both sales volume and pricing advantages, enabling it to grow revenue and maintain favorable profit margins.""McKesson is one of the best-positioned firms in the health care industry,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told IBD. ""They've been a very good performer.""The company also has a partnership with Omnicare (OCR), which provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.During its fiscal fourth quarter, McKesson's wholesale drug distribution business drove its sales to grow 19% from a year earlier to $44.9 billion. Excluding one-time items, its earnings from continuing operations climbed 15% to $2.94 a share.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 13% this fiscal year and another 15% in fiscal 2017.McKesson's stock price touched a high of 243.61 on May 19 and currently trades near 231. The stock is up more than 10% in 2015.A McKesson spokeswoman said that executives were not available to comment for this article. At a conference in May, Chief Financial Officer James Beer offered a bullish outlook on the fiscal year ahead.""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.Similarly, Morningstar's Lekraj said that acquisitions — particularly international ones along the lines of Celesio — would give McKesson added ""global purchasing power"" and complement its U.S. distribution operation.Boomer BoostSam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said.

Vertex said it would begin shipping the drug this week. Vertex shares had pulled back more than 8% below a 167.95 buy point, triggering the automatic sell rule. Shares have been testing support at their 10-week moving average.Drug wholesaler AmerisouceBergen spiked 11% in premarket action, after news reports said the company was in talks with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) regarding a possible takeover. Walgreens owns 26% of the company, which holds a market capitalization of more than $19 billion. During the market sell-off, AmerisourceBergen had pulled back 9% below a buy point at 94.54. That triggered the automatic sell rule.  The stock opened back above that entry on Tuesday, but the market's correction means the move is not a valid breakout.Walgreens shares rose 2% in early trade. Its shares are trading deep in a yearlong consolidation. AmerisourceBergen competitors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) dropped 4% and 2%, respectively, in early trade.Under Armour (UAA) grabbed a 16% gain, despite a mixed fourth-quarter report, as revenue came in stronger than expected. Shares ended Monday up 25% from a November low, and down 73% from its September 2015 peak.China-based names were early leaders, with IBD 50 name Weibo (WB) up 5% after an across-the-board fourth-quarter beat. Weibo shares are testing support at their 10-week moving average, after falling more than 8% below a 122.31 buy point and triggering the automatic sell rule.Sina (SINA) rolled ahead 5% after a generally strong fourth-quarter report. Sina, which holds a controlling stake in Weibo, also fell more than 8% below its 119.30 cup-base buy point, making it also subject to the automatic sell rule.Vipshop Holding (VIPS) swung 4% higher. The online retailer turned in its fourth-quarter report late Monday, topping analysts' earnings and revenue targets, and raising its first-quarter revenue guidance above expectations.Crude oil traded lower, after posting a 0.2% gain Monday — just enough to snap a six-day downtrend. U.S. benchmark crude was down 1% in early action, trading below $59 a barrel. Among other commodities, natural gas popped 2% — looking for a rebound after falling hard in nine of 10 recent sessions.

123,CAH,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

125,CAH,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

128,CAH,"A mixed finish Wednesday marked what was in many ways a single-handed victory for Apple (AAPL), as it lugged the Dow above the 22,000 mark, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 ended mostly unchanged.XThe iPhone maker thundered ahead 5% in massive trade, paring its initial 6% advance only slightly, and ending the session 1% above a 156.65 buy point in a flat base.The result left the Dow Jones industrial average with a 0.2% gain, and remaining ever-so-slightly above the 22,000 level after seizing that new high-water mark in opening trade. More than half of the Dow's 30 stocks traded lower for the day. Walt Disney (DIS) chalked up the index's worst performance, down nearly 2%, dealing a minor setback to the House of Mouse's effort to scale the right side of three-month cup base ahead of its fiscal third-quarter report scheduled for Aug. 8.The Nasdaq composite surrendered its gains early in the session as undertow from tech names led by Facebook (FB)(down 0.4%), Microsoft (MSFT) (down 0.4%) and Netflix (NFLX) (off 0.9%) outstripped gains from Apple, Illumina (ILMN) and Groupon (GRPN).The S&P 500 added less than 0.1% as it came under pressure from oil-related names led by Range Resources (RRC) (down 12%), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) (down 11%) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) (off 5%). Drug distribution giant Cardinal Health (CAH) also had some say, dropping 8% after topping fiscal fourth-quarter expectations, but guiding Q1 earnings below expectations.Aside from Apple, the day's big earnings winners were Illumina, Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) and Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT).Illumina soared 15% after reporting late Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings slipped much less than expected and revenue growth ratcheted up to 10%. Shares took out a 189.58 buy point in flat base and ended at the top of their buy range.Boot Barn kicked up a 17% gain after reporting late Tuesday that its fiscal first-quarter EPS soared 50% in a second quarter of acceleration. The less-than-$10 stock is now up 54% from a July 24 low as it scrambles up the right side of a steep nine-month correction.Spirit reported early Wednesday that its second-quarter earnings jumped 30%, its first gain in four quarters, topping analyst views by 30%. Its 18% gain launched shares past a 61.52 buy point in a five-month cup-with-handle base.Truck maker Oshkosh (OSK) pared its initial 12% surge to a 5% gain, enough to hold just above a 71.84 buy point in a cup-with-handle base after reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings up 63%, far above analyst targets and the company's best outing in four years.The session also saw winning runs break down for several leading stocks, most notably Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) and Coherent (COHR).Chipmaker Macom sliced off a 25% loss after compounding a weak fiscal Q3 report with below-target Q4 guidance. Coherent collapsed 22%, as a 214% gain in earnings and a 112% revenue advance missed expectations.

129,CAH,"A number of high-profile medical technology firms, including the likes of Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT), are unlikely to stand in the way of Dutch firm Philips' bid for heart device-maker Spectranetics (SPNC), an analyst said Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Spectranetics stock rocketed to a record closing high, up 26.2%,  to 38.35, after Philips announced its plan to acquire Spectranetics for $38.50 in cash per share. The deal values Spectranetics at 1.9 billion euros, about $2.16 billion.Needham analyst Mike Matson says the bidding will likely stop there as Boston Scientific, Abbott and Medtronic aren't expected to bid for the company. Spectranetics makes a drug-coated balloon called Stellarex as a treatment for a disease in which the arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and head narrow.Rivals C.R. Bard (BCR), Boston Scientific and Medtronic already make drug-coated balloons, Matson wrote in a note to clients. Further, Becton Dickinson (BDX) is acquiring C.R. Bard for $24 billion.That leaves three major firms in the sector that lack drug-coated balloons: Abbott, Cardinal Health (CAH) and Terumo.""We suspect Abbott is too preoccupied with its St. Jude Medical and Alere (ALR) acquisitions to pursue another large deal,"" he said. ""Similarly, Cardinal is in the process of acquiring Medtronic's medical supplies business for $6 billion.""IBD'S TAKE: The heart-valve sector heated up last year as Boston Scientific made an acquisition that could bring it closer to competing with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences  in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders a look at for how the battle is shaping up.Matson is unsure of Terumo's acquisition strategy.Similarly, he doesn't expect Philips' acquisition to get caught up with regulatory issues. Philips and Spectranetics only overlap in atherectomy, a process in which hardened or narrowed arteries are removed from the body. Philips got into the area with an earlier acquisition.""But we believe its market share is very low and think regulatory issues are unlikely,"" he said.Philips said Wednesday that it expects the deal to close in the third quarter. The Dutch firm expects to see revenue growth and profit accretion by 2018.Matson kept his buy rating on Spectranetics stock, though he boosted his price target to 38.50 from 34 to reflect the acquisition cost.RELATED:Medtronic's Edwards-Rivaling Unit Outgrows Broader Market In Q4Boston's Heart Valve Wins in Face-Off Trial With Rival MedtronicEdwards Rockets To 6-Month High On Strong U.S. Heart-Valve Sales

130,CAH,"XDrug and medical supplies distributor Cardinal Health (CAH) said it would buy the medical supply units of Medtronic (MDT) for $6.1 billion, mostly with debt. Along with weaker earnings guidance, Cardinal shares plunged early Tuesday.Cardinal Health is acquiring Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency units, including brands used. Combined, the units generated about $2.4 billion in revenue in the last four reported quarters, Medtronic said. They include 23 product categories across multiple market settings, including brands, such as Curity, Kendall, Dover, Argyle and Kangaroo, which are used in nearly every U.S. hospital.""This well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares had been rebounding since the presidential election as investors believed Donald Trump would be less aggressive on drug prices than Hillary Clinton, despite some of his statements. But the stock tumbled through its 50-day moving average after finding support there in 2017.But Cardinal now sees fiscal 2017 earnings per share at the low end of earlier guidance of $5.35 to $5.50. It expects the deal to be boost non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations by more than 21 cents in 2018, but still sees EPS that year to be flat to down in the mid-single digits.Cardinal Health will finance the acquisition with cash and $4.5 billion in new debt. Standard & Poor's and Fitch both put Cardinal's credit rating at risk of a downgrade, citing increased ""leverage.""Cardinal Health shares tumbled 11.5% to 72.39 on the stock market today, gapping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Medtronic dipped 3 cents to 80.33. Among Cardinal's fellow drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) sank 4.6% and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 4.7%.In 2015, Cardinal Health paid about $2 billion for Cordis from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), adding a portfolio of devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Medtronic said the transaction will reduce 2018 EPS modestly. Medtronic will spend $1 billion of the $5.5 billion in net proceeds from the deal on share buybacks, with the rest going to cut debt.RELATED:Johnson & Johnson Earnings Top, But Drug Sales Are A Drag

133,CAH,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

134,CAH,"CVS Health (CVS) isn't taking the threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) lying down.XNews that the drugstore chain is reportedly in talks to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for more than $200 per share hit just after reports that Amazon has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states.Aetna shares vaulted 11.5% to close at 178.60 on the stock market today. CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) lost 4.2%, McKesson (MCK) 5.2% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.CVS and Aetna, which serves 22 million members, already had close ties, with Aetna signing up the drugstore giant's Caremark unit as its pharmacy benefit management partner this spring.In June, Tarun Mehra of the Fuld & Co. consultancy wrote that CVS should buy Aetna: ""CVS has an impressive suite of assets already, but if it were to add a health plan to its portfolio, it would create a truly large-scale integrated platform across retail, PBM, MCO (managed care organization), and a distributor joint venture (with Cardinal Health, providing CVS with a strategic advantage over UnitedHealth Group (UNH)-OptumRx.""Yet in just a few months, the potential entry of Amazon has shaken up the $300 billion prescription-dispensing industry, and analysts are now speculating that UnitedHealth could partner with Amazon. UnitedHealth shares close up 0.8% and added 1.4% after hours.RELATED:Anthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

136,CAH,"Even though CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have repeatedly thrown cold water on the idea that Amazon.com (AMZN) will take on the $300 billion prescription dispensing industry, the idea just won't die.XOn Thursday, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes seemed to up the ante on Amazon's rumored interest in the sector, saying he expects it to happen. According to a write up from TheFly.com, Wilkes sees Amazon either buying or partnering with a pharmacy benefit management company, which would help drive volume and navigate industry regulations.Wilkes has been working in and covering the health care services arena for a quarter century, so his perspective that Amazon is well positioned to disrupt the industry may carry weight with investors. He noted his concern that Amazon's entry could negative effect PBM industry earnings.The report about Amazon is likely a longer run concern for investors, so the pharmacy focus Thursday was on weak sales from Rite Aid (RAD), which cited ""a challenging reimbursement rate environment"" and new generics holding down prescription prices as it reported earnings.Amazon shares added 0.6%, heading back toward its 50-day moving average. Rite Aid shares tumbled 11% to 2.03, hitting a four-year low on the stock market today. CVS, which is both drugstore and PBM, slipped 0.3%, while Walgreens lost 0.8%. Walgreens this month won FTC approval to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores after a long battle to buy all of its smaller rival fell apart due to regulatory objections.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which operates the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management company, rose 0.8% but lagged behind the solid gains seen by other managed care players. Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest pure-play PBM, was 0.2% higher.The health care group suffering the most on Thursday were drug distributors. McKesson (MCK) fell 1.4%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 1.75% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 1.7%.If Amazon were to enter the pharmaceutical industry, some industry watchers have speculated that it might cut out distributors and deal directly with drug manufacturers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD premium features are free through Oct. 8.

""In an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance.""Merlo said the ""highly regulated"" industry has high barriers to entry, and noted all the work required between pharmacists, payers and physicians. He added that patients put trust in their retail pharmacists, adding that mail-order pharmacy has declined in recent years.Some have speculated that Amazon could use Whole Foods locations as a place for in-store pharmacy pickups.RELATED:This $300 Billion Market Could Be Amazon's Next Casualty — Or NotRite Aid Stock Crashes On Same-Store DeclineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

While results are likely to show a decline in the core Pharmaceutical segment, growth across other segments is likely to make up partially.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, up 12.7% from the prior-year quarter and also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. Revenues came in at $35.19 billion, up 6.1% on a year-over-year basis, outpacing the consensus estimate of $34.69 billion.Notably, Cardinal Health has a negative average earnings surprise of 0.3% for the trailing four quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.51, reflecting a decline of 1.3% year over year.

QuoteLet’s delve deeper.Pharmaceutical Segment in FocusIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for an enormous 88.5% of the company’s revenues. Revenues in the segment came in at $31.15 billion, up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.However, it saw a 4% drop in profits to $514 million, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing and the recent investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics program performance. Per management, growth in the segment was further impeded by the expiration of a large mail order from Prime Therapeutics.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in at $29.63 billion, down 4.9% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayGuidance LiftedConsidering the benefits from the slashed federal tax rate, Cardinal Health raised the fiscal 2018 outlook. The company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.25-$5.50, as compared with the previous range of $4.85-$5.10.Medical SegmentIn the fiscal second quarter, this segment accounted for 11.5% of the company’s revenues.

170,CAH,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Apr 26, after the market closes. Favorable revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products, growing adoption of Proton Therapy and strong overseas presence are likely to drive the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings.Last quarter, the company delivered adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. Adjusted earnings also improved 112% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues totaled $678.5 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $639.47 million.In the second quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $693.9 million, reflecting a rise of 5.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at $1.03 per share, indicating an increase of 15.7% year over year.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Quote Let’s delve into factors which are likely to impact Varian Medical’s upcoming quarterly results.Factors at PlayOncology to Drive Growth:We are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenues in the last quarter. Notably, the company has been addressing the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has been winning international contracts in the oncology space.In a bid to overhaul its Oncology Systems segment, Varian Medical recently acquired Montreal-based privately-held Evinance Innovation, Inc. — a clinical decision support (CDS) software company. The deal was initiated in September 2017. The company had stated that it will utilize Evinance’s patented technology to offer better services to clients.On Mar 20, Varian Medical announced that St. Petersburg Center of Nuclear Medicine successfully completed its first pediatric patient treatment with the Varian ProBeam proton therapy system.Product Launch: The successful launch of Halcyon Therapy System deserves a mention in this regard. Varian Medical has been undertaking initiatives to attract customers to its broad spectrum of products. Recently,  the company unveiled the Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system recently.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Halcyon platform witnessed 62 orders since its inception in 2017. This reflects solid demand for the platform in the quarters ahead.On Jan 8, Varian Medical announced that its Halcyon system has received Taiwan FDA approval, which will allow the company to market this new cancer treatment system in the country.On Feb 6, Varian Medical announced the Halcyon cancer treatment platform received Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) Certificate for Import and Supply in India.For 2018, the company expects revenues in the range of 4-7%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the band of $4.24-$ 4.36, while cash flow from operations are projected in the range of $475-$550 million.Cut-throat Competition:Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Elekta and Accuray.In the emerging proton therapy market, the company faces competition from Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo. Intense competition is anticipated to increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market, which will dent margins. Moreover, pricing pressure in traditional radiotherapy is a major concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

171,CAH,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 26, before the market opens. Positive tidings on the regulatory front, expanding product portfolio, strategic collaborations and strong presence in the international markets are key positives at the moment.We expect the company to witness steady growth in Hospital Products sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other sub-segments will generate impressive results.Last quarter, Baxter posted adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents and improved from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 57 cents.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.62 billion, reflecting a rise of 5.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 62 cents, indicating an increase of 6.9% year over year.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteLet’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Baxter’s first-quarter 2018 results.Hospital Products to Drive Q1 ResultsBaxter has an impressive product portfolio with improved existing products and new product development. Recently, the company announced a distribution agreement for the U.S. launch of the Arisure Closed System Transfer device.In the last quarter, Hospital Sales were driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Sales in the segment benefited from solid demand for the company’s advanced surgery products and cytotoxic contract manufacturing services.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hospital Products revenues is pegged at $1.67 billion. This reflects an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here we take a sneak peek at the major sub-segments within the Hospital Products and how are they poised to gain in the to-be-reported quarter:Surgical Care:Surgical Care (includes anesthesia and BioSurgery) sales recorded year-over-year sales growth in the last quarter, on low double-digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by growing demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally as well as increased U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC — a fast-acting IV beta blocker.On Mar 19, Baxter completed the acquisition of two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc to expand the existing surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants, especially for intraoperative bleeding. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Baxter’s surgical portfolio includes products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others. The portfolio is composed of hemostasis (addressing bleeding), tissue sealing and hard tissue regeneration as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery with products available in nearly 60 countries.The company consistently strives to improve its Advanced Surgery business. For 2018, the company expects advanced surgery business to increase 3-4% on a constant-currency (cc) basis.Baxter announced plans to focus on launching advanced surgery products in Japan in the coming days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $576 million, reflecting a rise of 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Fluid Systems: Within Hospital Products, sales in Fluid Systems is expected to be solid on robust IV solution sales in the United States. We expect Fluid Systems to maintain the trend in the first quarter.This is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Systems of $621 million for the first quarter, reflecting 6.2% rise from the year-ago quarter.Integrated Pharmacy Solutions (IPS): Global sales of IPS, another sub segment within Hospital Products, increased by a formidable margin in the last quarter, partly on the back of increased sales for premixed injectable drugs.However, Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years has lacked luster, majorly. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose threats to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to be approximately $95 million, reflecting a decline from $185 million in 2017. For the upcoming quarterly result, lower cyclophosphamide sales are expected to impact the top line by low single digits.For the first quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IPS is pegged at $598 million, showing an increase of 8.3% from the year-ago number.Other Factors at PlayGuidance: Baxter expects first-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of 60-62 cents. However, net sales in the first quarter is expected to be affected by approximately $25 million due to disruptions in the Puerto Rico facility. For 2018, Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 6-7% at cc. Adjusted earnings for 2018 are expected in the band of $2.72-$2.80.Regulatory Approvals: Baxter has been witnessing positive tidings on the regulatory front. Recently, Baxter announced the approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection (bivalirudin).Management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico. With this development, Baxter now has four operational sites approved to address demand in the U.S. markets.Dull Projection for Pharmaceutical Unit: For 2018, the pharmaceutical business, which includes Baxter’s broad generic injectables portfolio, anesthesia and critical care products as well as hospital pharmacy compounding services conducted outside the United States is expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The lackluster performance is primarily driven by increased competition for select products in the segment.Further, in the Other business segment, which primarily includes Baxter’s contract manufacturing services, management expects low single-digit decline in 2018. Per management, sales in the segment benefited from a customer stockpile order in 2017. Baxter expects lower manufacturing revenues from Shire, which it acquired two years ago.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Baxter is 0.00%.

172,CAH,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Apr 26, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings in all business segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in Orthopaedic Implant sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company generate impressive results.Notably, last quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.96 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.20 billion, reflecting a rise of 8.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating an increase of 8.1% year over year.Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Skryker’s first-quarter 2018 results.Orthopaedic Implant in Focus – Mako RobotsOrthopaedic Implant contributed 62.5% of net revenues in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopaedic Implant stands at $1.21 billion, reflecting a rise of 6.3% year over year.Recently, Stryker introduced the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with its Mako System. Notably, this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures.Notably, Mako Total Knee utilizes Stryker’s robotic platform and its Triathlon Total Knee System, guided through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy. Per Stryker, the system enables intra-operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Mako Total Knee platform drove Stryker’s earnings. Mako robot installations totaled 35 globally, with 27 in the United States. Additionally, the company had its first robot sale in Japan, where the approval for Mako is expected by the end of 2018.The company exited 2017 with 372 Mako robots installed in the United States.Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus  Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus | Stryker Corporation QuoteOther Factors at PlayMedSurg Unit to Drive GrowthMedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.In the last quarter, management announced MedSurg as a high-growth segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg-Endoscopy revenues surged 12.6% year over year to $420 million.Acquisition-Driven StrategyStryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to drive growth. Recently, Stryker acquired Entellus Medical, Inc. in an all cash transaction for $24 per share or an equity value of approximately $662 million. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures.Of late, Stryker acquired VEXIM, which specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for €183 million. VEXIM's flagship product is the SpineJack system, a mechanical expandable VCF implant for fracture reduction and stabilization. VEXIM's portfolio is highly complementary to the interventional spine business of Stryker.Stryker's Instruments division includes an extensive and innovative portfolio for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency ablation procedures along with a diagnostic tool and decompression treatment advances for contained disc herniations.Lower Demand for Healthcare ProductsStryker persistently faces challenges from lower demand for health care products. Additionally, the company’s spine business in the United States was plagued with supply issues in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, Stryker expects to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.The company has been facing challenging economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Additionally, lower reimbursements for medical products and services may impose a downward pressure on the prices for the company’s products, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies, which will ultimately impact the top line.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. It can be illustrated below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Stryker is +0.35%.

173,CAH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Cardinal Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Cardinal Health’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15.9 over the past five years. In fact, the current level stands closer to the lows for the stock, suggesting great scope for entry.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.0. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Cardinal Health’s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Cardinal Health has a P/S ratio of about 0.1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Cardinal Health currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Cardinal Health a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) ratio for Cardinal Health is just 6.4, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 17.0. Clearly, CAH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Cardinal Health might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B. This gives CAH a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite discouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go down in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen three downward and no upward revisions in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 7.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dropped 2.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and ConsensusCardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteGiven these bearish trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCardinal Health is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 21% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

174,CAH,"On Feb 2, we issued an updated research report on  Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report), a leading scientific instrument maker. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Thermo Fisher ended the fourth quarter on a promising note with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We are encouraged by the company’s solid international performance with strong year-over-year growth in the Asia-Pacific and the emerging markets like China, South Korea and the Middle East.Also, a series of product launches along with major progress in precision medicine initiatives has benefited the company’s performance. Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of FEI Company has already started to boost its analytical instruments portfolio.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Quote Also in 2017, the company deployed $7.8 billion on strategic acquisitions, adding leading biopharma contract development and manufacturing services through Patheon. Significantly, enhancing the company’s value proposition for biopharma customers, Patheon has started to contribute to the company’s laboratory products and the services segment.Additional good news is that Thermo Fisher has a strong cash balance enabling it to provide solid returns to investors.Over the past three months, Thermo Fisher has successfully traded above the broader industry. The stock has rallied 17.2%, surpassing the broader industry’s 13.5% gain in the period.The promising 2018 guidance is all the more encouraging indicating that this overall bullish trend will continue throughout the year ahead.Last quarter, the company’s business segments were impacted by strategic investments and an unfavorable business mix. Also, competitive headwinds and rising operating costs persistently pose a threat. This apart, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to foreign currency fluctuations.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

176,CAH,"Cardinal Health’s (CAH  -  Free Report) premarket approval (PMA) application for INCRAFT (INCRAFT Stent Graft System) recently received favorable recommendation from the FDA. The Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee voted 11 to 4 in favor of the system.Notably, the INCRAFT system comes under Cardinal Health’s Cordis unit, which was acquired earlier in 2015. However, by the end of third-quarter fiscal 2018, the Cordis unit’s performance lacked luster. It significantly affected Cardinal Health’s earnings and effective tax rate.Hence, the PMA for the INCRAFT system has been a timely one which will help Cardinal Health secure a broader customer base for the Cordis unit.The INCRAFT System at a GlanceThe INCRAFT system is a cardiovascular platform.It has an advanced endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) technology for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), a severe and complex condition.Per an article by Experimental & Clinical Cardiology, AAA rupture causes 4500 deaths each year in the United States, with an additional 1400 deaths resulting from the 45,000 repair procedures performed to prevent rupture.Market ProspectsPer Research and Markets, the global market for cardiovascular devices reached nearly $42.4 billion in 2017 and should scale to $59.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 6.9% in the 2017-2022 period.The report further states that with medical needs of patients at an all-time high, any increase in incidences will lead to significant growth of the cardiovascular market.Price PerformanceWe believe that positive developments will boost the shares of Cardinal Health, which have declined 28.5% in a year’s time, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 8.8%.Other Major ProductsCardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings lend the company a competitive edge in the niche space. The company offers industry expertise and an expanding portfolio of safe products. For example, Cardinal Health’s Bathroom Safety, Mobility, and Exam Room Equipment products are exclusively designed for patients and care givers. With a variety of products, ranging from wheelchairs and crutches to exam room tables and commodes, Cardinal Health offers the right mix of medical equipment.Cardinal Health’s ECG Monitoring Electrodes offer quality performance and are free of neoprene, lead and mercury. These are not made with natural rubber latex and are highly exclusive in the markets.Cardinal Health offers a full line of baby products as well, which includes Baby Shampoo & Body Wash, Baby Lotion, Baby Powder, Baby Oil and more.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCardinal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

177,CAH,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and focuses on investing in key businesses to gain traction and boost profits. In line with this, the company recently entered into an agreement to buy the radioactive diagnostic drug Lymphoseek from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals.We are also encouraged to note that Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements. The company entered a long-term agreement with Henry Schein, under which the latter purchased Cardinal Health’s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive Cardinal Health’s earnings over the long haul. Meanwhile, Cardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment has been gaining on solid client retention, with the loss of only a few key customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report).Recently, Cordis, a Cardinal Health company, and Medinol announced the receipt of FDA approval of the EluNIR drug-eluting stent (DES) for treating narrowing of or blockage in coronary arteries. Cardinal Health also recently launched the Opioid Action Program.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 18.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry's gain of around 17.4%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues.Also, Cardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For instance, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from the likes of McKesson and AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The sale includes Cardinal Health's pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in China.The company’s asset disposal will help streamline its Chinese operations. The liability of employees, infrastructure and various systems and processes will be transferred to Shanghai Pharma upon closing of the transaction.Share Price MovementCardinal Health’s price movement in the past six months has been unfavorable. The company’s shares have lost almost 14.1% compared with the industry's gain of 2.2%. The current level is also lower than the S&P 500’s rally of 4.8%.  Coming back to the news, the divestiture does not include Cardinal Health's remaining businesses in China. These include Cordis, the company’s recently acquired Patient Recovery business, and its medical sourcing team.Cardinal Health, headquartered in Dublin, OH,  is a national drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers.Recently, Cardinal Health reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2017 (ending Sep 30, 2017) numbers, courtesy of a stable performance by the Medical segment. An encouraging fiscal 2018 guidance also instills our confidence in the stock. Meanwhile, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth.Although the Pharmaceutical segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, profits at the segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Increasing generic pricing pressure is a major headwind. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.

180,CAH,"Intuitive Surgical Inc.’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, expected to release on Apr 17 after market close, are expected to show steady growth in the instruments and accessories segment.Revenues in all other segments are also expected to help the company generate solid results.Last quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $2.54 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.27.

The consensus estimate for earnings is $1.99, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 17.1%. Intuitive Surgical delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 15.01%.Let’s delve deeper:Instruments & Accessories in FocusThe instruments and accessories segment delivered solid results last quarter, accounting for 52.3% of total revenues. The company’s flagship da Vinci surgical system continues to be a revenue driver for the segment.  For the first quarter, 2018 the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $435 million, showing a rise of 14.2% year over year.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The solid forecast indicates that the company will release encouraging numbers for the first quarter as well.Procedure growth is expected to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States.Management expects operating expenses to rise 16-18% in 2018 as the company continues to invest in emerging markets and new technology, including computer-assisted surgery.Gross margin is expected within 70-71.5% of net revenues in 2018.Global ExposureIntuitive Surgical gained significantly on the CE Mark approval for da Vinci X in Europe. Increased use of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, continued growth in neurology in Europe and Japan and multispecialty growth in Korea and China also contributed to the rally.Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the Ministry of Health in Japan listed for reimbursement in 12 procedures. In the quarter, revenues from outside the United States increased 17%, both sequentially and on year-over-year basis.CompetitionIntuitive Surgical is currently facing stiff competition in the niche space.

182,CAH,"The buzz about Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains persistent in Capitol Hill. The lukewarm response to its replacement, The American Health Care Act (AHCA), has forced Republicans to continue to seek new avenues. In a bid to save its face, the Trump administration attempted a “skinny"" repeal bill which failed to make any headway in the senate.Going ahead, we believe the impasse is slated to continue as President Trump has always been an outspoken critic of the ACA. Our apprehension comes from the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a slew of events including the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed, a stronger dollar, debate over the fate of Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) and the stance of healthcare insurance companies over ACA. These are expected to spark bouts of volatility. Added to these factors are the effects of Hurricane Harvey over the bourses and the reasons which are worrying investors.Amid this uncertainty, finding investment options that are not perturbed by market gyrations is a tough decision.Dividend Investing to the RescueAs evident from the MedTech story, stocks can be volatile and are risky at times.. With uncertainty ruling the markets, it is not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing themes.Dividend stocks are always investors’ preferred choice as they provide steady income and cushion against market risks. These stocks are generally less volatile in nature and hence, are dependable when it comes to long-term investment planning. They not only offer higher income in the current environment – where rates remain low despite expected hikes – but also provide relief in adverse market conditions.Dividend stocks are a safe bet to create wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis.How to Pick the Best Stocks?Although the benefits of dividend investing cannot be stressed enough, one should keep in mind that not every company can keep up with its dividend paying momentum. Hence, investors need to be cautious in order to select the best  stocks with the potential for steady returns.We have used the Zacks Stock Screener to narrow down to four stocks that offer decent dividend yield and have a market cap of $1 billion or more.

184,CAH,"U.S. stock markets witnessed a choppy session on Thursday. In the initial hours of trading all three indexes entered the negative territory. However, indexes recovered most of their losses over the rest of the trading session. Finally, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite ended in the red while the Dow managed to gain marginally. Uncertainty about the Fed’s future plans, concerns regarding an impending trade war and weak earnings results fueled market volatility.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 23,930.15, increased by a marginal 5.17 points. However, the S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.2% to close at 2,629.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,088.15, also decreasing 0.2%. A total of 7.56 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.61 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.36 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.80 to -1 ratio.The CBOE VIX decreased 0.4% and closed at 15.90, after touching 18.53 (up nearly 16%) in the early hours of trading. This was the biggest one day jump of Wall Street’s fear index since April 6.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow gained 5.17 points by the end of trading reversing he spate of losses suffered over the last four successive sessions. However, the blue-chip index was down by 393 points in the early hours of trading and fell below its 200-day moving average at 23,750.30. Finally, the index recovered its losses and closed above this psychological barrier. Notably, 19 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the red while 11 traded in the green.The S&P 500 decreased 0.2% led by 0.9% decline of both the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF). Notably, 7 out of 10 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. In the initial hours of trading the benchmark index was down as much as 1.6% breaking below its 200-day moving average. The index recovered most of its lost ground but still closed in the red.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2% after dropping more than 1% during the trading session. Strong performance by large-cap tech stocks helped the tech-laden index to make up for most of its losses, in the final hour of trading.Uncertainty Regarding Fed’s Policy  As inflation touches the Fed’s target level of 2%, the market is expecting any of the two strategies from the central bank. The central bank may raise the magnitude of benchmark interest rate or it may increase the number of interest rate hikes in 2018. It may also speed up the winding down of its bond purchases further.However, the central bank did not provide any clear-cut indication about its future monetary policy after its recently concluded meeting. Industry watchers and economists are divided about the Fed’s future moves regarding the pace of rate increases. Higher interest rate will raise cost of funds for both corporate and individual and will strengthen the dollar affecting U.S exports.Trade War Fear Looms LargeTrade war fear remain heightened even though a high-level delegation led by the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet Chinese counterparts this week to negotiate trade related disputes.Meanwhile, President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications equipment makers from selling products in the United States.Weak Earnings Results On Thursday, several large companies posted weak earnings results in an otherwise extremely strong first-quarter earnings session.Shares of American International Group Inc.

Although the reading was lower than the consensus estimate of 0.9%, it was better than the 0.3% reading of the fourth quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, jobless claims for unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended April 28 falling to its lowest level since 1973.

187,CAH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Cardinal Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Cardinal Health’s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Cardinal Health has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Cardinal Health stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Cardinal Health has a P/S ratio of about 0.2. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Cardinal Health currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Cardinal Health a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Cardinal Health might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A. This gives CAH a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the full year estimate has seen seven up and two down in the same time period.This has impacted the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 5.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCardinal Health is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 15%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past year, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

QuoteMargin AnalysisGross Profit increased 10.7% year over year to $1.91 billion.As a percentage of revenues, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 5.7% of net revenues.GuidanceThe company slashed guidance for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share to $4.85-$4.95. The current range is significantly lower than the previous estimate of $5.25-$5.50. The downside was caused by the company's effective tax rate associated with the Cordis business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $136.11 billion.   Our TakeCardinal Health exited the quarter on a tepid note with adjusted earnings missing the consensus mark. The company witnessed encouraging performance in the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment registered strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Further, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth.Despite growth in business, profits in the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarters. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.

191,CAH,"On Feb 20, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company exited the second quarter on a solid note, courtesy of encouraging performance by the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment also witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. A strong fiscal 2018 outlook buoys optimism.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 17.4%, comparing unfavorably with the industry's gain of around 9.9%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues. However, the company’s share price has been rising since the second-quarter earnings release. The stock has gained 4.1% till yesterday’s close.Cardinal Health’s Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings lend the company a competitive edge in the niche space. The company offers industry expertise and an expanding portfolio of safe products. Also, Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and continues to focus on investment in key growth businesses to gain market traction and boost profits.

The buyout particularly boosted the company’s Medical segment.Further,Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements.

The collaboration is expected to drive core sales and prove accretive to Cardinal Health’s earnings in the long term.Despite growth in business, profits at the company’s Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiency in the upcoming quarter.

The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.However, the segment witnessed a 4% decline in profits to $514 million, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing, recent investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics program performance.However, solid performance by the Specialty Solutions business partially offset the negative impact in the segment.Medical SegmentRevenues in the segment improved 18.6% to $4.04 billion, primarily on higher contributions from new and existing customers.Medical segment profits increased 38% to $220 million, courtesy of higher contributions from new and existing customers and acquisition of the Patient Recovery business.Share-Repurchase ProgramThe company’s board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of the company’s common shares, which will expire on Dec 31, 2020.With the latest authorization, Cardinal Health is authorized to repurchase up to $1.3 billion of its common shares.MarginsAs a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 5.3% of net revenues. However, gross profit in the quarter was $1.86 billion, up 16% year over year.Distribution, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1313 billion.GuidanceConsidering the benefit of 40 cents per share from the lower federal rate due to U.S. tax reform, Cardinal Health raised fiscal 2018 outlook. The company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $5.25-$5.50 per share, higher from the previous range of $4.85-$5.10.Our TakeCardinal Health exited the quarter on a solid note, courtesy of encouraging performance in the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Further, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth. A strong fiscal 2018 outlook buoys optimism.On the flip side, despite growth in business, profits at the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarter. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks. Recently, the company recently closed  divestiture of its Cardinal Health China distribution.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

193,CAH,"On Feb 6, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report), a major commercial laboratory services provider. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Quest Diagnostics have outperformed the broader industry over the past year. The stock has gained 8.1% against the broader industry’s 2.6% decline.We are encouraged to note that both earnings and revenues increased year over year during the recently-reported fourth quarter. Also, the company’s bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Incidentally, Quest Diagnostics has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. It is currently refocusing on core diagnostic information services business and disciplined capital deployment.The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are looking forward to the company’s recently-closed buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service, a national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services. This apart, the 2018 guidance looks promising with an indication for this bullish trend to continue.Later in 2016, Quest Diagnostics came up with an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholder value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.The company expects 3-5% revenue growth for the period from 2017 to 2020. Earnings for the same time frame are expected to better revenues at a faster rate in the mid-to-high single-digit range. Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders is creating ample opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while simultaneously improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.After suffering several quarters of dull volumes, the company has finally started to see improvement in terms of both volume and pricing. However, sustainability of this progress is still doubted. Further, reimbursement woes remain.Also, Quest Diagnostics is highly disappointed with the recent CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act. In December 2017, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association came forward to support a lawsuit against the Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The lawsuit charged that the CMS, operating under the HHS purview, has failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

195,CAH,"Dublin, OH-based Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), a global player in the healthcare services and products space, is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 2, before the bell.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, at an average of 4.05%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Outlook: Management at Cardinal Health is bullish about significant cash generation in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the company’s Cordis business is expected to generate accretive returns in the quarter.We note that despite solid commercial momentum on a global basis, the Cordis segment generated sluggish returns in the last reported quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, Cardinal Health is expected to leverage on the Patient Recovery business in the Cordis profile.Meanwhile, Cardinal Health reaffirmed the fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $5.35–$5.50. The outlook represents growth of approximately 2–5% from the prior fiscal.Pricing Pressure in Generics Portfolio: Cardinal Health has been grappling with pricing deflation in the generics segment for long. Per management, reimbursement pressure is likely to affect the company’s customer base and also impede generic launches in the near term.Incremental expenses, specifically in the Pharma segment, might dent profits in the fourth quarter.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: Cardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For example, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from McKesson and AmerisourceBergen as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor. Intensifying competition in the global markets is likely to mar Cardinal Health’s top line in the fourth quarter.Estimate Revision Trend: The company’s estimate revision trend lacks luster. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 6.5% to $1.24 per share, adding to our concerns.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cardinal Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Of the total, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights like Laboratory Corporation Of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report). The companies ended the fourth quarter on a solid note with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence. In this regard, LabCorp’s adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 is in the range of $11.30-$11.70. Further, Becton, Dickinson and Company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $10.85-$11.00, up from the previous $10.55-$10.65.For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth.CAH or HOLX: Which Will See Stronger Earnings?Let’s take a look at two major MedTech stocks Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and Hologic, Inc.

With a diverse product portfolio, Cardinal Health is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.14, down 14.9% year over year. The company faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which will severely impair the bottom line. In fact, Cardinal Health announced the loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics.

The Diagnostics segment is expected to record revenues of $285 million, down 12.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $279 million shows a 14.2% decline year over year.

197,CAH,"On Feb 4, 2018, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the U.S. House and Senate’s decision to suspend the medical device tax for another two years has come as a breath of fresh air to medical device mammoths like Boston Scientific. Per the company, this temporary suspension will in turn allow it to continue with its plans for investing in innovative medical products. Meanwhile, the company is intent on working toward complete repeal of the MedTech tax.We are also encouraged by Boston Scientific’s major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede. This move is expected to consolidate the company’s position in the growing field of mitral regurgitation (MR) falling under its structural heart business. Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for treatment of severe MR. On a positive note, the product claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state.This apart, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance. The promising 2018 view is also impressive.On the flip side, declining worldwide pacemaker sales over the recent past continued to weigh on Boston Scientific's CRM (Customer Relationship Management) results. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company witnessed a high single-digit decline in pacemaker performance due to tough comparisons drawn with stronger revenues reaped after the U.S. launch of the company’s Brady MRI linepost in April 2016. Although of late, the company has taken several measures to rebound this trend, the near-term outlook still looks bleak.Additionally, the fate of Lotus valve issue seems in limbo for some more time for Boston Scientific as recently, the company announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe and the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall last February. In sync with the above downtrends, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 5.5% compared with the broader industry's 3% rise in the period.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

199,CAH,"Putting an end to speculations, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has finally stepped into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry. In line with this, the online retail behemoth recently announced a definitive acquisition agreement with PillPack. Although the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, a few market experts estimate the value of the transaction at $1 billion.This news was heavily cheered by investors, sending Amazon’s share price 2.5% higher on the day of the announcement.Does Amazon’s Entry Spell Doom for Pharmacies?Although Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business was well speculated, it still came as a shocker for industry bigwigs. Let’s take a closer look at the reactions of some of the behemoths.Amazon.com, Inc. Price  Amazon.com, Inc. Price | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBeginning with, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), which has been basking in the glory of being added as the youngest member to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, saw a 9.9% decline in stock price on the day of the buyout announcement. The company also saw a rating downgrade by a number of analysts.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stocks of other big retailers like Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) also slipped around 11.1% and 6.1% on the same day.CVS Health Corporation Price  CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer reports, three of these bigwigs collectively lost about $12.8 billion in market value on the day.Rite Aid Corporation Price  Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteMajor drug distributors like Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) also panicked, with stocks falling a respective 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.1%.How Rational is the Deal for Amazon?In an era where brick and mortar set ups are being challenged by online sellers, though Amazon’s entry into the prescription drug industry is welcome news for consumers, it is also fraught with challenges.Coming back to the buyout, PillPack is an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. It also holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and has URAC and VIPPS accreditation. It is an in-network pharmacy with most pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) along with major Medicare Part D plans.Per an article on STAT, the integration of PillPack will help Amazon become a major player in the $370-billion drug business.Some analysts believe that with PillPack, which is working with Medicare plans, Amazon will be able to see an increase in its Amazon Prime membership of the rapidly-growing age group of 65 and above. There are high chances that 100 million Prime subscribers with Amazon will choose the company for their prescription drug needs.However, the deal has come with its own set of challenges. Per an article published on PYMNTS.com, PillPack sources products from AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots. Further, per the same article,  there were rumors in the recent past about Walgreens Boots’ plans to buy AmerisourceBergen, which might pit Walgreens Boots against Amazon in the space.PillPack’s in-network membership with Express Scripts is also subject to renewal at the end of July. It is being speculated that if Amazon appears to be a formidable threat to the PBMs they might start refraining from renewing the in-network memberships in future (per an article published on PYMNTS.com). With regard to this, Amazon had to let go of its 40% stake in Drugstore.com as PBMs denied to include Drugstore.com in their networks. This  eventually resulted in Drugstore.com exiting the prescription business (per an article published on AXIOS).How Bad is the News for Pharmaceutical Giants? ""You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.""Nothing could more aptly sum up this situation than this remark by Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO. The incumbent players in the drugstore industry don’t seem to be in a mood to give up and lose their turf. To counter competition, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and others have started to add more digital and customer-friendly programs. These companies have incorporated mail order pharmacy models to their stores with same day/one day to two days delivery programs.Further, CVS Health’s deal with United States’ third-largest health insurance company, Aetna, will fortify its position in the industry.In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens Boots has tied up with Express Scripts and has announced plans to expand existing group purchasing efforts. Per reports, Walgreens Boots is also collaborating with a number of healthcare businesses, including health insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group.The company is also partnering with lab testing provider Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to expand the range of health services at its stores.Further, some analysts believe those preferring cash payments are expected to opt more for Amazon’s pharmacy services. The percentage of this population is quite nominal. Moreover, patients with the need for immediate drugs will approach stores over waiting for online delivery.Considering these factors, major analysts believe there is enough scope left for these behemoths to maintain a competitive edge in the space.Summing UpAmazon’s entry has definitely created an upheaval in the prescription drug industry with major players struggling to keep afloat. However, in business, bankable human resource and strong financial position matter the most. And Amazon has an adequate amount of of both. So, the following quote from Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, Reuters suitably sums up the current scenario — “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

202,CAH,"Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), a global player in the healthcare services and products space, is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 6, before the closing bell.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The stock delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.25%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Outlook: Management at Cardinal Health is bullish about significant cash generation in the first quarter. Furthermore, the company’s Cordis business is expected to generate accretive returns in the quarter under review.We note that despite solid commercial momentum on a global basis, the Cordis segment generated sluggish returns in the last reported quarter. However, in the first quarter, Cardinal Health is expected to leverage on the Patient Recovery business in the Cordis profile.Meanwhile, Cardinal Health affirmed the fiscal 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $4.85-$5.10. The outlook represents growth of approximately 2-5% from the prior fiscal.Pricing Pressure in Generics Portfolio: Cardinal Health has been grappling with pricing deflation in the generics segment for long. Per management, reimbursement pressure is likely to affect the company’s customer base and also impede generic launches in the near term. Incremental expenses, specifically in the Pharma segment, might dent profits in the first quarter.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: Cardinal Health witnesses tough competition in each of its business segments. For example, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from several smaller medical-surgical distributors. Intensifying competition in the global markets is likely to mar Cardinal Health’s top line in the first quarter.Estimate Revision Trend: The company’s estimate revision trend lacks luster. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared with no upward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 6.5% to $1.01 per share, adding to concerns.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cardinal Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Cardinal Health is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.01. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cardinal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Cardinal Health, Inc.

203,CAH,"Cardinal Health Inc (CAH  -  Free Report) underperformed its industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have lost 28.6%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 6.4%. The current return is also lower than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 13.1%.Recently, Cardinal Health has been facing sluggishness in the exam-gloves unit. Further, cutthroat competition in the niche space is a headwind.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line declined9.2% in the last two months to $4.92. This shows a year-over-year decline of 8.9%. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom linedeclined 29.5% in the last two months to 93 cents. This indicates a fall of 29% on a year-over-year basis.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus  Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Here we take a peek at the major issues plaguing Cardinal Health.Issues in Medical-Gloves UnitCardinal Health offers a robust portfolio of medical gloves including surgical gloves, exam gloves and clean-room gloves. While the Medical segment has been performing well in the recent quarters, the company has been facing challenges in the exam-glove sub-segment.In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, commodity pricing and supply disruptions have dampened the section. For fiscal 2018, lower expectations for the Medical segment due to headwinds in the exam-gloves segment is concerning. However, the company’s sourcing and commercial teams are pursuing several projects to minimize the impact.Cordis Unit Lacks LusterCardinal Health took over Johnson and Johnson’s Cordis unit for $1.94 billion in 2015 to enhance its top-line performance. But, by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, things have not been very bright for Cardinal Health, especially in the Cordis unit.The Cordis performance not only reduced the company’s adjusted operating earnings, but created a higher-than-expected adjusted effective tax rate (19 cents). Of this, Cordis-related increased tax-rate was 13 cents.Taking this into consideration, Cardinal Health anticipates obstacles and challenges in fiscal 2019. Per management, despite prospects in the Patient Recovery in Red Oak and subsequent U.S. tax reform, the company will face significant headwinds including Cordis performance, customer repricing, the loss of PharMerica and continued generic deflation.Consequently, Cardinal Health is not expected to achieve the 6% margin rate in the second half of fiscal 2018.Cutthroat Competition in Niche SpaceCardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For example, the pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from McKesson and AmerisourceBergen as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor.Moreover, the medical device market is mature whencompared with Cardinal Health’s pharmaceutical business. We believe that growing competition will hurt Cardinal Health’s medical segment’s margins in the near term.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report), Genomic Health, Inc (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report).Abiomed has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 27%.

204,CAH,"The old adage – sell in May and go away – may rest on historical run but is not entirely true if we go by recent years’ data. Per an article published on CNN.com, the proverb proved itself wrong in the past few years, with the May-October period turning pretty profitable.Maintain a steady trend, May 2018 too witnessed decent performance despite a raft of geopolitical tensions. The S&P 500 index has gained 2.8% in the past one month (as of May 30, 2018) while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite has scored solid gains of 5.6%.Key Events of May The month was packed with global events, which more or less impacted Wall Street too. There was Italy’s political crisis, which sparked fears of the region leaving the Eurozone, although tensions subsided at the end.Oil prices were on a roller-coaster ride thanks to the push and pull between two opposing forces — one is the fear of rising output by Saudi and Russia and the other is the report of lower-than-expected crude inventory built, and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.Then there was uncertainty in diplomatic ties between North Korea and the United States. Trump first pulled out of the scheduled June meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un on May 24, citing North Korea’s “tremendous anger and open hostility” toward Washington. But after North Korea expressed keenness to resolve the issue, an effort to retrieve the canceled summit between the duo was launched. The jostle weighed on the broader stock market for a while.Trade tensions flared up between China and the United States as the latter announced that it will levy 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China and impose new limits on Chinese investments in the United States. Trump also plans restrictions on imported steel and aluminum from Europe.Developments at home were upbeat with President Trump announcing a drug plan which is in line with the best interest of drug makers and deregulations in the banking sector which especially ease rules for smaller financial institutions. Several U.S. economic data also came in better than other developed economies.Against this backdrop, several sectors and their stocks came in upbeat in May while many have fallen apart. So, it would be intriguing to know which stocks gained and which ones lost in in May.Gainers Below we have highlighted three stocks that gained more than 100% in the last four weeks (as of May 30, 2018). These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Evolus Inc.

205,CAH,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CAH.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen seven estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $5.41 a share a month ago to its current level of $5.09.Also, for the current quarter, Cardinal Health has seen six downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.03 a share from $1.31 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 11.2% in the past month.Cardinal Health, Inc.

206,CAH,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

207,CAH,"Over the past few months, the medical device space has been witnessing considerable upheaval owing to a confluence of factors. This has affected the fortunes of MedTech bigwigs like Cardinal Health Inc (CAH  -  Free Report), DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc (XRAY  -  Free Report) and Penumbra Inc (PEN  -  Free Report).The investment climate for medical device majors has become increasingly volatile due to political potshots in Capitol Hill, for and against Obamacare. This is due to the fact that the GOP is making one final push on an Affordable Care Act repeal bill. The legislation, commonly referred to as Graham-Cassidy, aims to convert the Medicaid and premium subsidy dollars into a block-grant structure giving freedom of spending to states.Past fortnight has witnessed extensive lobbying for and against the Graham-Cassidy bill by legislators to garner for and against the required 50 votes at the Senate. The trend is expected to continue till September 30. Earlier, Obamacare assured coverage to people with pre-existing ailments and restricted insurers from charging them based on health conditions.The Senate Bill, however, will allow insurers to provide less-than-required coverage in states that get waivers for essential health benefits. However, the changes would not take effect until 2020 but would slash Medicaid budgets to the tune of almost 25% by 2026.How Is MedTech Positioned?Though the space remains volatile, there are many stocks in the MedTech domain that promise growth. The question now arises that how to pick  safe stocks from the various industries of the MedTech space, in such a scenario. Within the Zacks Industry classification, it is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into important areas like Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products and Medical - Dental Supplies.Screening CriteriaIn this article, we have picked a winner from each of the aforementioned areas that have traded higher than the S&P 500 index through the past one year. Also, based on their strong fundamentals, strategic implementation, planned execution and certain positive catalysts, they carry a huge upside potential and a high probability of outperforming the S&P 500 index in the coming days.These stocks currently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows investors to eliminate negative aspects of stocks and select favorable ones. Their market capitalization is in multi-billions, testifying to their strong liquidity.The 2017 estimate revision trend is significantly positive and earnings growth expectation is above the S&P 500. Finally, the industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside to offset any further volatility in Capitol Hill.Medical - Dental SuppliesThe Dental Supplies industry is currently ranked #185. It fell from last week’s #170. The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 by shedding 0.25% over the past month. The index, on the other hand, has gained 1.94%. By applying Zacks wisdom in this space, we are bullish on STAAR Surgical Company (STAA  -  Free Report).Monrovia, CA-based Staar Surgical develops, manufactures and distributes products used by ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals to improve or correct vision in patients suffering from refractive conditions, cataracts and glaucoma. With a price surge of approximately 14.06% over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick. Earnings for this company are expected to grow 9.25% over the next five-year period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medical – InstrumentsThe Instruments industry is currently ranked #97. It fell from last week’s #88. The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 by registering a gain of only 0.97% over the past month. The index has gained only 1.94%. In this space, we are bullish on Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report).Irvine, CA-based Masimo develops, manufactures and markets a family of non-invasive monitoring systems. With a price surge of approximately 27.26% year to date, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick. Earnings for this company are expected to grow 11.10% over the next five-year period.Medical – ProductsThe Products industry is currently ranked #174, falling from #161 during last week.  The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 by registering a gain of only 1.80% over the past month. The index on the other hand has rose 1.94%%. In this space, we are bullish on Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report).Smith & Nephew, headquartered in London, U.K., is a manufacturer and distributor of advanced medical devices in the sports medicine, joint reconstruction, trauma and wound management areas. With a price surge of approximately 19.68% year to date, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick.

210,CAH,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) – one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares has lost 13.9%, comparing unfavorably with the 5.4% decline of the broader industry.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's QA and QC (quality assurance and quality control) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends AmerisourceBergen a competitive advantage over the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. In this regard, AmerisourceBergen witnessed a significant negative revenue impact from the declining sales at the segment in the second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an added concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors include Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and McKesson (MCK  -  Free Report) along with national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 26.6%.

211,CAH,"It’s been a tough week for generic drugmakers which saw their shares tumbling following the release of disappointing second quarter results from Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report). Teva not only missed on earnings and revenue expectations, the company also slashed its 2017 outlook and announced a 75% cut in its dividend.Teva’s shares plunged 34.1% in the two trading sessions following the release of second quarter results reflecting concerns about the company’s business and debt burden which triggered a few analyst downgrades. Year-to-date (YTD), Teva has lost 43.2% of its value versus the 12% decline of its industryChallenging Generic Pricing EnvironmentA key reason for Teva’s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.On its second quarter conference call, Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Generic drugs are basically cheaper versions of branded drugs which have gone off patent.Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year.And it’s not just Teva that was affected by the tough generic pricing environment in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), which reported a mixed quarter, saw its shares decline 11.4% over the two trading sessions following the release of third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company mentioned that generic deflation remains a headwind and is yet to ease from the high single digits, where it's been for about three quarters. Generic deflation is expected to remain a headwind for the remainder of fiscal 2017 in the range of -7% to -9%. The situation may continue in fiscal 2018 as well.Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) too mentioned that generic drugs pricing was a material headwind for the company’s Pharma Distribution business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects generic deflation in mid-single digits in fiscal 2018.Stocks in FocusFollowing the release of Teva’s second quarter results, companies with a presence in the generics market saw their shares declining on concerns that these companies too will be affected by the generic drug pricing environment. Companies like Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report), down 10.8%), Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI  -  Free Report), 10.9% down), Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report), down 6.5%) and Impax Laboratories, Inc. , down 10.7%) were down over the last two trading sessions. This week, investors will be focused on Mylan’s second quarter results including the company’s take on the generic pricing situation. Impax and Perrigo will also be reporting results this week. While Mylan, Perrigo and Impax are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, Lannett is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % ReturnIn our view, generic price erosion will remain a headwind for the remainder of the year and affect the margins of generic players. With the FDA focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process, the market will continue to witness additional competition and escalating generic price erosion.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

213,CAH,"The second-quarter earnings season has been quite impressive so far, with 286 members in the S&P 500 cohort having reported their results. Per the latest Earnings Preview, second-quarter earnings as a whole are expected to rise 9.2% year over year on 5% growth in revenues.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to record earnings growth in the quarter. As of Jul 28, 58.2% of the members from this sector posted impressive earnings and revenue beats of an average 84.4% and 68.8%, respectively.With the majority of bigwigs yet to report results, the next week will be crucial in deciding whether this quarter will turn out to be a real game changer for the sector. At the end of the quarter, the sector is anticipated to witness 4% earnings growth on the back of a 4.3% revenue hike.MedTech Faces Political TumultThe political gridlock over the pullback of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare has been making headlines in the MedTech space since long. Amid such political conundrum at the Capitol Hill, market watchers will keep a tab on the MedTech space.The fraternity worries whether the final ‘Trump-care plan’ will include the ‘MedTech tax repeal’ in its agenda. Meanwhile, the old template of the plan, which promised to eradicate the infamous 2.3% medical device tax and the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) was not a bad deal.Amid such a hullabaloo, the question that emerges is how medical technology players stand to gain or lose this earnings season. Let’s take a look at four major medical technology bigwigs that are expected to release earnings results on Aug 2:Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report)This Dublin, OH-based global player in the healthcare services and products space is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, before the bell.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis.

That is because, as per our model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat earnings. Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cardinal Health, Inc.
