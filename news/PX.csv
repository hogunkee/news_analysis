8,PX,"Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) turns to market disrupters like Align Technology (ALGN) and long-term secular trends in shaping its investment strategy, which has landed the fund among the top mutual funds in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards.The $1.9 billion fund has been led by Clay Brethour, Dave Carlsen and Elizabeth Jones since 2004. ""We seek the early identification of attractively priced, financially strong, well-managed companies,"" Carlsen said. ""We take a patient approach to stock selection, looking for stock opportunities where long-term growth is underappreciated or where there's been an overreaction in the near term.""The approach has paid off for the top-performing mutual fund. It has beaten the S&P 500 in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. In doing so it won IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards in both the Growth Fund and Midcap Fund categories.Over the last 10- and 15-year periods the fund has turned in average annual returns of 13.6% and 14.7%. These gains have handily surpassed those of midcap growth funds tracked by Morningstar, which have posted 9.6% and 11.4% returns for the same periods. Where does that put it among top mutual funds? Buffalo Discovery's 10- and 15-year annual average returns ranked among the top 3% and 2% of Morningstar midcap growth funds.In 2017, Buffalo Discovery returned 25.4%. It earned a top-three ranking in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards list for midcap funds.Innovation is essential for inclusion in the Buffalo Discovery portfolio. ""We've found that our focus on innovation is one of the best ways to hitch our wagon to share gainers and market disrupters,"" Carlsen said. ""We believe these companies will be the most likely to reap the rewards of the big secular growth trends.""Carlsen's team uses secular trends to home in on worthy portfolio candidates. ""The secular trends provide a growth tailwind and narrow our stock picking universe to a durable growth universe that we believe should grow faster and have less cyclicality than the overall market,"" he said. ""Our growth universe establishes our hunting grounds, not the constituents of a benchmark index. This purposely distances us from relative benchmark portfolio management styles leading to high active share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Buffalo Discovery team looks for companies that can gain market share in almost any market environment. ""We let our innovators run,"" Carlsen said. ""We have a preference for small- and midcap stocks with long runways for growth where the benefits of innovation are sustainable and early relative to the potential opportunity, resulting in high rates of growth for many years.""Buffalo Discovery owned 86 stock holdings and maintained an annual turnover ratio of 53% as of Dec. 31. Technology, industrials and health care were its three largest sector weightings.Top holding Align Technology has been a mainstay in the portfolio for much of Carlsen's tenure. The stock has surged more than 4,000% since the maker of Invisalign was added to the portfolio in 2005, and has climbed into large-cap territory. The Buffalo Discovery team still sees plenty of room to run. ""We believe robust growth is sustainable over the intermediate to long term,"" Carlsen said. ""Less than 15% of the orthodontic market has converted from metal braces to clear aligners. The company has also been focused on driving down the cost of its product resulting in tremendous growth internationally.""In Q4, Invisalign case shipments spiked 34% on a year-over-year basis.Carlsen sees the fund's stake in Nevro (NVRO) benefiting from an aging population and a government push away from opioids for pain management. ""The company makes high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices that treat chronic back and leg pain more effectively and with better clinical outcomes than competing SCS devices from traditional players,"" he said. ""It has rapidly gained nearly 15% market share and remains well positioned for further share gains and rapid growth. Continued product innovation like smaller footprint devices should expand the market and recent full-body MRI approval in Europe bodes well for future U.S. approval.""Xylem (XYL), the No. 2 holding of the fund, enables municipal and industrial customers to manage water systems more efficiently. ""They've incorporated sensors and analytics to proactively provide alerts when a problem requires attention, before it breaks and causes costly downtime,"" Carlsen said. ""They have also incorporated intelligence on pumps to use less energy and boost efficiency. The company should have earnings growth in the midteens over the next several years.""Shares of Xylem are up 50% from a year ago.In the tech space, the Buffalo Discovery team is bullish on the video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA). ""Video game companies have enjoyed a strong year as investors realize the positive business model effects of downloadable games and in-game content,"" Carlsen said. ""Emerging online player networks should help further expand the user base as players connect from around the world.""Electronic Arts has seen its stock price rise 43% over the past year.Buffalo Discovery bought shares of Praxair (PX) in 2015. The industrial gas supplier was a top 10 holding at year-end. ""It is a premier operator and serves a consumable (product) to a diverse set of industrial customers,"" Carlsen said. ""This tends to insulate it from negative flash points in the economy. Its strategy is to grow profitably regardless of the macroeconomic environment. The name brings some nice stability to our portfolio.""Shares of Praxair are up 31% versus a year ago.With an eye on its current holdings, the Buffalo Discovery team remains on the lookout for opportunities to add innovators to the portfolio.""We believe the market frequently overreacts to near-term events, which will create opportunities to buy premier stocks at attractive prices,"" Carlsen said.""The market volatility experienced this past February is the most recent example. Only through active management can an investor benefit from these temporary market dislocations. Anyone can ride an index fund or ETF up during the bull market, but you need the skill of an active manager to protect your capital when the tide turns.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 Special ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?

10,PX,"In an industry clogged with look-alike mutual funds, an ESG focus helps Calvert Equity Fund (CSIEX) stand out. The $2.2 billion fund bases its buy decisions not only on fundamental financial analysis but also on socially responsible criteria.X ESG refers to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. ""Investors are attracted to this approach (using ESG factors) because they want to invest in companies that are solving these pressing ESG challenges,"" said Anthony Eames, director of responsible investment strategy for Calvert Research & Management. ""Over time, companies that get ESG factors right benefit from that, and that's good for the companies and their shareholders.""The financial fundamentals that the fund's four managers screen for are designed to find ""companies with consistent growth and stability in earnings,"" said Joseph Hudepohl, one of four Atlanta Capital Management co-managers who subadvise the fund for Calvert. Both Atlanta and Calvert are units of Eaton Vance.""Companies like that can thrive in any environment,"" he added. ""They're not reliant on the capital markets for funding, so they can withstand periods like (the financial crisis of) 2008-09, and they can compound over time.""Those traits are reflected in fund performance: strong, not dazzling, with lower downside risk than many of its peers.Calvert Equity outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 for the past year going into Thursday, up 30.87% vs. 26.95%. Large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Direct averaged 32.56%. And the fund provided shareholders with a smoother ride than its peer group has over time periods stretching from three to 15 years. Over the past three years, for example, the fund has gone down less than 85% of the S&P 500 in downturns, while its peers have averaged declines of more than 110% vs. the big-cap bogey.Calvert analysts sift through a universe of about 2,500 stocks. They pass a pool of 100 to 150 stocks that meet its ESG standards to the fund's Atlanta Capital co-managers. ""Then, based on our financial criteria and (low) valuation, we gravitate to the 45 to 50 names that make it into our portfolio,"" Hudepohl said.""Our universe of high quality businesses overlaps a lot with Calvert's universe of businesses that meet their ESG standards,"" he added.He says companies that satisfy the criteria tend to have tail winds because of those traits. ""There are long-term benefits to focusing on clean water like Danaher (DHR), for example, and on clean air like Praxair (PX).""Danaher's products include water treatment and vapor recovery systems. Its earnings per share rose 8%, 10% and 15% the past three quarters. Shares are up 27% in the past 12 months.Praxair makes atmospheric gases, process gases and industrial gas production equipment. EPS grew 7%, 5%, 6% and 8% the past four quarters, which followed eight quarters of EPS declines. Share price rose 37% in the past 12 months. The stock yields 2%.ESG criteria do not prevent the fund from investing in stocks that are popular among investors. FANG stalwarts Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are holdings.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Apple's strengths — like its five quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Calvert Equity's thesis for Facebook focuses on what Facebook excels at. ""Advertising dollars go where the eyeballs are,"" Hudepohl said. ""The internet is taking (consumers) eyeball time away from other media. And Facebook is one of the top truly global platforms after Google (for attracting consumers). It benefits from worldwide growth in attracting advertising dollars.""Equity managers like the steady earnings growth prospects for both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). ""They're two of the better examples of high-quality growth stocks and what we're looking for from a financial perspective,"" Hudepohl said about the credit card giants.Both companies also appear to have long runways in front of them. ""Amazingly, half of all transactions in developed markets are still in cash, so there is a lot of opportunity there,"" he said. ""And within emerging markets like India, China and South America, 90% of transactions are still done in cash.""And the two companies avoid taking on consumers' credit risk. ""They don't carry loans (from consumers),"" Hudepohl said. ""They are paid on each swipe of a card because of their technology. And the number of swipes is increasing.""Also, the companies have huge free cash flow, Hudepohl says. ""So they don't depend on capital markets to grow their businesses,"" he said. That means they don't have to issue stock or pay interest on loans or bonds to pay for capital expenditures or develop new technology.Charles Schwab (SCHW) benefits from a long-term secular tail wind of online brokers gaining market share, Hudepohl says. Also, Schwab stands to gain from rising interest rates. ""(The) low interest rate environment forced Schwab along with the rest of the industry to grant fee waivers on money market funds,"" Hudepohl said. ""As rates rise, those fees are being reinstituted.""""Secondly, the low rate environment also compressed net interest margin,"" he added. ""As rates rise, the spread that Schwab earns on its assets should continue to expand. Both benefits carry very high incremental margins to Schwab.""RELATED:Here's How Wall Street Professionals Play Bitcoin — Should You?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

X IBD's unique RS Rating tracks market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks matched up against all other stocks. History reveals that the best stocks often have an 80 or better RS Rating as they begin their biggest price moves. See if Praxair can continue to show renewed price strength and hit that benchmark. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HerePraxair broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 138.79 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to form. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Praxair posted 5% earnings growth last quarter. Sales rose 6%. The company earns the No. 14 rank among its peers in the Chemicals-Specialty industry group. Ferro (FOE), Versum Materials (VSM) and C S W Industrials (CSWI) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Stocks With Rising Relative Strength RatingsWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

21,PX,"Baidu (BIDU) will use Nvidia (NVDA) tech in its cloud-computing platforms and self-driving vehicles. The pact, announced Wednesday, expands an existing partnership between the two tech companies and fuels momentum for autonomous technologies.Autonomous or self-driving technology is too complicated and too important to do it yourself. At least that seems to be the message as automotive companies and technology firms such as General Motors (GM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Intel (INTC) form self-driving alliances as they try to figure out where they need one another to fill in gaps in expertise.The logic behind Detroit-Silicon Valley pacts is straightforward. Automakers know how to mass produce, distribute and market vehicles, as well as manage tens of thousands of factory workers, whereas tech giants have the edge on electronics, crunching data and rapid innovation.Autonomous and partially autonomous cars will account for 12%-13% of global vehicle sales by 2025, representing a market for those features of roughly $42 billion, the Boston Consulting Group has estimated.Here is a rundown of key ""driverless car"" alliances:XChipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Chinese Internet company Baidu (BIDU) jointly announced Wednesday that they will work together on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to power cloud data centers, self-driving cars and consumers devices such as home assistants.Notably, the agreement calls for Nvidia's Volta GPUS to be used in Baidu Cloud and its Drive PX supercomputer to be used in Baidu's self-driving car efforts. Baidu simultaneously announced it now has over 50 partners on board its Apollo program, which aims to develop self-driving cars with major Chinese carmakers.Shares of both companies rallied more than 2% on the stock market today.In June, Nvidia announced it is extending self-driving partnerships with European automakers Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Volvo, as well as car-parts maker ZF. The companies will work on advanced artificial intelligence systems for next-generation autonomous technologies.In August 2016, Nvidia and Chinese search giant company Baidu (BIDU) agreed to build a cloud-based computing platform for self-driving cars. It was described as one that would be available for purchase by automakers for their own self-driving vehicles.Apple (AAPL) is leasing six cars from a Hertz (HTZ) subsidiary for testing autonomous software, reports in late June said.While Apple recently confirmed it is working on technology for self-driving cars, it was not clear whether the company will make its own car or just produce the technology for automakers. Reports last year said Apple tried to partner with Daimler and BMW but was rejected.Alphabet and car-rental company Avis Budget (CAR) announced in late June they will work together on self-driving cars. Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, will rely on Avis to service and store its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans as part of a pilot program in Phoenix, Ariz.In May, Alphabet's Waymo said it would partner with Lyft. Details of the tie-up are sketchy, but it threatens a ride-sharing rival Uber. Waymo is also engaged in a legal spat with Uber.Uber has partnered with German automaker Daimler AG (DDAIF) and Japanese automaker Toyota Motors (TM) for new mobility solutions. It has also reportedly chased self-driving deals with Tesla (TSLA), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and others.Meanwhile, in January 2017, General Motors invested in Lyft to spur deployment of its cars in autonomous ride-sharing fleets. In February 2017, Ford said it would invest $1 billion in an obscure startup, Argo AI, to build fully self-driving cars. In April 2017, Fiat Chrysler delivered minivans for Waymo-Alphabet's self-driving program.In mid-May, BMW Group, Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) announced that they will partner with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to bring autonomous driving solutions to multiple automakers.Delphi will play a key role in integrating the solution delivered by BMW, Intel and Mobileye into OEM (original equipment manufacturer) vehicle architectures, the companies said in a joint news release. It also may provide components such as sensors and help with customizations to help vehicle brands differentiate themselves.The Delphi partnership is seen as likely to benefit smaller car companies lacking resources to build their own systems.Mobileye, which produces camera-based driver-assistance systems, joined forces in July 2016 with Intel and BMW to make self-driving cars a reality in about five years. In August last year, Delphi and Mobileye teamed up to make turnkey autonomous systems for auto and truck makers.Then in March 2017, Intel decided to acquire Mobileye in a $15 billion deal, capitalizing on the Israeli tech firm's driver-assistance and anti-collision expertise.Delphi said in early May it would focus more aggressively on autonomous driving and would spin off its powertrain unit.In October 2016, Qualcomm (QCOM) agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), the largest automotive chip supplier, for $47 billion. The mega chip deal is expected create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving.Elon Musk's Tesla combines auto-manufacturing expertise and technological expertise into one package. The electric carmaker touts its vehicles as having the hardware needed for full self-driving capability, while also testing autonomous technology on the roads, with plans to take it mainstream.Tesla counts Nvidia, whose chips act as the brains of self-driving cars, as a partner. Tesla also partnered with Mobileye, until the two companies broke up over issues tied to Tesla's Autopilot hands-free technology.But chief executive Musk is largely on his own as far as self-driving goals go.RELATED:Tesla Slammed By Goldman Sachs As Sell Rating ReiteratedGoogle's Self-Driving Car Deal Boosts These Rental Car LeadersGoogle's Waymo, Uber Rival Lyft Team Up On Self-Driving CarsDelphi Breaks Out On Earnings, Spinoff In Shift To Self-Driving Future

27,PX,"It took a while for the stock market to shake off March's malaise, but it finally did, with the S&P 500 advancing 1.03% in April, according to Lipper Inc.Reflecting that, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds gained 1.02% as a group last month. Large-cap growth stock mutual funds led the way, notching a 2.65% gain on average.World equity funds did even better in April rising 2.54%. And that helped put them ahead for the past three months with a 7.31% gain.Now several fund managers say they are looking for stocks that should thrive despite the increasing volatility that they expect going forward. Technology, industrials, materials and banks are where they're finding some answers.The broad stock market fell in the first two weeks of April. ""Going back to the fourth quarter, there was a lot of enthusiasm for potential policies (that would help stocks) when Trump and a Republican majority in Congress were elected,"" said Brian Flanagan, lead manager of $1.6 billion Thrivent Mid Cap Stock Fund (AASCX). ""Then reality set in when investors saw how hard it might be for some policies to get enacted.""Flanagan's fund is an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner for 2017, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.In addition, early April's market was still weighed down by March's disappointing jobs report and weak retail sales, said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.The stock market perked up as corporate earnings reports topped expectations, said Bernie Horn, a manager of $418 million Polaris Global Value (PGVFX), another IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner by virtue of having topped the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years.In addition, steady if modest economic growth in Asia and Europe began to hearten investors, Horn said.Global science/technology funds led all sector categories, climbing 3.78% in April.World equity funds gained 2.54% on average, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. European region funds rose 4.04%, pacing world equity categories.Taxable bond mutual funds edged ahead 0.75% on average, with Treasury funds up 1.04% and world income funds up 1.11%.Earnings surprises were a key to the late April rally. ""In the small-cap space, there were a lot of upward earnings forecast revisions, especially in technology, telecom and materials,"" said Vincent Costa, co-manager of $322 million Voya Index Plus SmallCap (IPSIX), also an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner.Still, several stock mutual fund managers expect more volatility ahead. ""There will be more volatility in the second half of the year,"" Costa said. ""When the Trump agenda gets announced and we have more clarity on what will come down — and what might not — we'll see more volatility. And any disappointments in earnings will fuel volatility.""Polaris' Horn says the U.S. economy appears to be ramping up after years of stagnation. ""We had eight years of a zombie economy — no real signs of life,"" he said. ""That's changing. We've seen reductions in capacity in areas such as China just as demand has picked up. This is especially helpful to the materials sector.""Horn likes BASF (BASFY). ""The big German chemical company is starting to see some increases in volumes and pricing, especially in China and Asia,"" Horn said. ""It adds to their ability to generate strong cash flows, which will support higher valuations.""Methanex (MEOH) is another materials stock he likes. The Canadian company makes methanol, which is used in the manufacturing of a variety of materials. ""They're the largest methanol producer in the world, and they're seeing a lot of increase in demand from China,"" Horn said.The stock's recent slump reflects the repair closure of a key manufacturing facility in China. ""That is not a long-term problem,"" Horn said.Praxair (PX) is another materials stock favored by Horn. ""This is another early-economic cycle company with broad exposure to many industries,"" Horn said. Earnings per share grew 7% in the first quarter, the first report of positive growth after eight straight quarters of decline. ""This shows that underlying industrial production in all parts of the economy is getting better.""Like Horn's view on materials, Nuveen's Chalupnik sees an improving outlook for industrials. Industrials sector funds gained 1.99% in April.Chalupnik cites Tennessee-based NN (NNBR), which makes bearing components for the automotive, electrical, agricultural and other industries.Chalupnik oversees the team that runs $1.4 billion Nuveen Small Value (FSCCX), another IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner.""NN makes precision parts that help cars, for example, improve fuel economy,"" Chalupnik said. ""They've diversified into aerospace, rail, industrial and medical markets. They benefit from U.S. and global growth. Their free cash flow generation is increasing, which they're using to pay down debt.""Airlines are an industrials segment that Thrivent's Flanagan likes because they added capacity but have done it to create new segments of low-cost no-frills seats. ""These basic economy fares let them compete with ultra-low-cost airlines,"" he said.He cites Southwest Airlines (LUV). ""Many investors were worried about them increasing capacity, but they've done it in a disciplined manner,"" he said. ""Capacity will peak this year. That, combined with a new reservations system, should let them maximize revenue per available seat mile.""Voya's Costa remains bullish on banks and outsourcing and consulting within information technology services. In health care, his fund is looking for companies that stand to gain from a rollback or repeal of ObamaCare.Costa and his colleagues expect rising interest rates to further boost banks' net interest margins. Banks accounted for the fund's three biggest holdings as of March 31. Sporting IBD's SMR Rating of A, the banks are Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI), Sterling Bancorp (STL) and Evercore Partners (EVR). Great Western Bancorp (GWB) was the fund's 10th-largest holding and also has an A SMR Rating.IBD's TAKE: SMR is a proprietary rating pioneered by IBD to help investors identify companies with superior Sales Growth, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity ratios. You can learn more about how to use SMR here at IBD's website.EPlus (PLUS) is one of Costa's smaller holdings. But the provider of IT management products, services and software has a 19% three-year annual earnings growth rate. Shares were up 24% this year through April 30.Flanagan also expects banks, especially regional ones, to continue to benefit from a warming U.S. economy and lighter regulatory burden. Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY) is one. It acquired First Niagara Financial Group last year. ""Investors are seeing synergy savings that are higher than were expected,"" Flanagan said. ""They should also benefit from net interest margin expansion as interest rates rise. And they're starting to see loan growth. Plus, their valuation is lower than their peers' on average.""Flanagan also likes the outlook for information technology stocks. His fund holds Applied Materials (AMAT), a leading semiconductor equipment and software maker. ""They're benefiting from the increased complexity of semiconductor manufacturing,"" Flanagan said. ""OLED screens"" — which use organic light emitting diode technology — ""are rumored to be coming on the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 8."" That should be an additional tailwind for Applied, Flanagan says.RELATED:Managers Seek Sturdy Stocks Amid Expected Rise In Volatility

36,PX,"Linde and Praxair (PX) ended talks to create the world's largest supplier of industrial gases, with sources saying that the German company's concerns over jobs and operations at its Munich headquarters the sticking point.The companies had agreed to broad terms and management roles, people with knowledge of the matter said Monday, asking not to be identified as the information is private. They planned to base the holding company for the combined entity in Europe, with the operational center in Praxair's hometown of Danbury, Connecticut, the people said. Linde asked for guarantees to base certain operations and jobs at its Munich headquarters, the people said. Talks between the CEOs broke down over that issue, they said.Linde shares fell 7.7% to 137.50 intraday in Frankfurt, giving it a market value of about $29 billion. Praxair rose fractionally to 117.60 just after the opening bell on stock market today in New York.Linde and Praxair had been in talks since mid-August about a merger that people familiar with the situation at the time said would have been an all-stock deal and may have been valued at more than $30 billion. The tie-up would have been the biggest deal so far in a wave of consolidation triggered by French rival Air Liquide SA's takeover this year of Airgas for $13 billion including debt.IBD'S TAKE: Praxair, with a 2.6% dividend yield, has been a long-time stock winner, though it's lagged the S&P 500 in the past few years. Earnings and sales have declined for several quarters amid tough economic conditions, though sales have been falling at a slower pace and consensus forecasts predicted higher earnings in 2017 through 2020. A rebound off the 200-day moving average might be a potential buy area for income investors.The transaction would have attracted scrutiny from antitrust regulators after Air Liquide, which counts refineries, soda bottlers and welders among its customers, bought Airgas of the U.S. That left only four major suppliers, including Praxair, Linde and Air Products & Chemicals (APD).During the ensuing weeks since August, Linde and Praxair had agreed that Praxair Chief Executive Officer Stephen Angel would run the combined company, with Linde Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle holding the same title and Linde CEO Wolfgang Buechele as president, the people said. The chief financial officer would have come from Praxair.The deal also met opposition from some Linde executives and labor representatives, according to people familiar with the matter. Linde Chief Financial Officer Georg Denoke had some concerns about the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.The discussions were for an almost 50-50 split of ownership in the new company and equal board representation, the people said. The companies aimed for more than $1 billion in annual synergies, they said.The sticking points proved too much to overcome. Preliminary discussions about a combination have ended, according to statements from the companies Monday. While the strategic rationale of a merger ""has been principally confirmed,"" the companies didn't come to an agreement on governance issues, Linde said in a regulatory filing.A spokesman for Linde declined to comment beyond the press release, while a representative for Praxair couldn't be immediately reached for comment outside U.S. business hours.""The overlap of businesses was so big that they would've had to divest a lot,"" Metzler analyst Lars Hettche said by phone. ""I was surprised that they pulled out as soon as this though."" Talks may have broken down over a ""question of power"" including the location of the headquarters, he said.In a historical twist, the tie-up would have reunited the U.S. industrial gas business with the German company it created more than a century ago. Praxair was started in 1907 by Carl von Linde, a pioneer in refrigeration who helped found the company that bears his name. The firm emerged from the Union Carbide group as an independent business in 1992.Linde CEO Buechele has been cutting costs after a move into supplying gases to treat chronic illnesses such as asthma failed to offset slowing demand among industrial customers. Joining with Praxair may have helped overcome investors' concerns about Linde in an industry where returns are steady yet growth is limited.Now, management will be under pressure to convince shareholders of Linde's stand-alone prospects, especially as its annual profit margin of about 12.27% lags behind Praxair's 22.82% profitability, according to Bloomberg data. That could lead Buechele to be more rigorous on reducing costs, according to Andreas Heine of MainFirst Bank.""We were not convinced that the merger would be beneficial for Linde shareholders,"" DZ Bank analyst Peter Spengler wrote in a note Monday. ""There is no need for a merger at this large scale in our view.""RELATED:Potash Corp., Agrium To Merge, Creating Fertilizer Giant

Monsanto shares, which were at 106.10 before the deal, have drifted down to 103.50, reflecting concerns that the merger won't pass antitrust muster.IBD'S TAKE: The domestic chemical industry is booming, with U.S. and foreign companies spending some $170 billion on 268 projects. Credit cheap natural gas at home. Read more about the renaissance in ""Shale 2.0: A Follow-On Boom In The U.S. Chemicals Trade.""Monsanto previously had sought to buy Swiss-based Syngenta (SYT), but Syngenta rebuffed those advances, in part on antitrust concerns. Syngenta has accepted a takeover offer form China's ChinaChem.Also this month, Praxair and Germany's Linde ended talks on an industrial gases megamerger, with the fate of Linde's Munich headquarters an apparent sticking point.One advantage to foreign takeovers of U.S. companies is that the change of ownership can lower the tax bill of the newly acquired firm. The Obama administration has tightened restrictions on tax inversions, wherein U.S. companies buy a foreign firm but redomicile overseas to lower taxes on non-U.S. operations. But that does nothing to reduce the tax incentives of foreign purchases of American companies.Amid the cross-border chemical romances, there are domestic tie-ups.

39,PX,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone demand appears higher than conservative forecasts, giving Apple and the broader markets a lift. Wells Fargo (WFC) is still reeling from the major cross-selling fraud scandal. General Motors (GM) said its Chevy Bolt will have a higher battery range than the Tesla Motors (TSLA) Model 3, as Tesla and others gave autonomous vehicle updates. Two huge agribusiness mergers were announced.The major averages followed the Sept. 9 sell-off with several large and up-and-down days. Fed Gov. Lael Brainard's dovish comments Monday helped reassure investors that a September rate hike was highly unlikely. Meanwhile, Apple powered ahead on stronger-than-expected demand for its iPhone 7. Apple, which boasts the world's biggest market cap, is part of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day line and rose 2.3% for the week. The S&P 500 and Dow, up 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, remained below that key support level.Apple started selling its 10th-generation smartphone, the iPhone 7, on Friday along with its second-generation smartwatch, Apple Watch Series 2. AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) said iPhone preorders were better than for last year's iPhone 6S, while Verizon (VZ) said they were in the normal range for an iPhone launch. Apple said it sold out its initial production run of iPhone 7 Plus and jet-black color iPhone 7 handsets. Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones because of battery fires could help Apple gain smartphone market share, analysts said.Apple rose 11.4% to 114.92, its best weekly gain in years and blasting past a 110.33 buy point on Wednesday.August retail sales fell 0.3% and industrial production sank 0.4%, both worse than expected. But struggling apparel stores, groceries and restaurants reported higher sales. September's Philly Fed manufacturing index jumped far more than expected, while the New York Fed's Empire State index remaining negative. But the most important economic news may have come Monday, when Federal Gov. Lael Brainard signaled she would prefer to be cautious with rate hikes. That reinforced expectations that the central bank will take no action at this week's policy meeting.Wells Fargo shares continued to slide over the cross-selling fraud scandal, losing nearly 7% for the week. After paying a $195 million fine and firing 5,300 workers, Wells reportedly faces a federal criminal probe. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank (DB) tumbled 9.4% Friday after the Justice Department said it wanted $14 billion to settle a probe into its mortgage securities from 2005-2007.""Let's just raise rates,"" JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said during the week, following more bullish sentiment from Fed officials over a potential rate hike that would likely boost banks' finances. At the Barclays Global Financial Services conference, Bank of America (BAC) said Q3 investment banking had improved, while the quarter so far for Citigroup (C) appeared more mixed. Both touted their international prospects.Intel expects third-quarter revenue of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion vs. its prior range of $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion. That's a 7.8% yearly gain at the midpoint, the best since Q3 2014. The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory"" but also is ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand."" Intel also raised gross margin targets. Intel shares rose 3% Friday, briefly hitting its highest levels since January 2001.Oil prices were on track to fall for the week as reports indicated that production is rising faster and demand increasing at a slower pace. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries released its monthly oil report Monday that production from nonmembers will increase by 200,000 barrels a day in 2017 vs. a prior outlook of a decline or 150,000 barrels per day in its August report. On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that global crude demand will only rise by 1.3 million barrels a day this year as Q3 demand slows at a faster pace than expected. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise 559,000 barrel drop in domestic crude stockpiles. But production rose by 0.4% to 8.493 million barrels per day. Also the IEA debuted its World Energy Investment report, which found that investment in the energy sector in 2015 fell 8% year-over-year to $1.8 trillion.General Motors' all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, due out this fall, will have an EPA-estimated 238 miles per charge, topping Tesla's promised range for its Model 3, which won't be out for another year. Tesla said its new Autopilot software upgrade would rely more on radars than cameras, an update that Musk says would've likely prevented a fatal crash; Mobileye (MBLY) said it split with Tesla over Autopilot safety issues.

On Tuesday, Mobileye (MBLY) announced a partnership with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) for autonomous driving.Chipmakers like Intel (INTC), Nvidia and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are gearing up to make a play for autonomous-driving business from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Tesla, among others. The automotive opportunity is expected to be massive as sales for smartphones and PCs slow.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock rose 0.6% to 62.91. As of Monday's close, Nvidia shares are up 90% for the year, as IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group has risen 23%.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 10 on the latest IBD 50, the ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months. Shares are more than 20% extended from a 46.64 buy point, at a point where investors should consider locking in at least some profit.The Drive PX 2 platform is driven by two Parker processors and two Pascal-based GPUs (graphics processing units), Nvidia senior director of automotive Danny Shapiro said in a blog post Monday. Pascal succeeded Nvidia's Maxwell GPU in April.GPUs are traditionally installed in PCs to handle heavyweight image rendering for games, but Nvidia is also parlaying its bread-and-butter chips for the machine learning at the crux of self-driving cars.""Working in concert with Pascal-based supercomputers in the cloud, Parker-based self-driving cars can be continually updated with newer algorithms and information to improve self-driving accuracy and safety,"" Shapiro wrote.Carmakers can use the Parker processor alone or integrate into the Drive PX 2 system for more complex systems, he wrote. Drive PX 2, itself, can run 24 trillion deep-learning operations per second. North of 80 automakers are developing systems on Drive PX 2.RELATED:

44,PX,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) is making a grab for NXP Semiconductors' (NXPI) piece of the autonomous-driving market, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said Wednesday after Nvidia unveiled the guts of its self-driving engine.On Monday, Nvidia revealed its Parker mobile processor, which the company said is 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors. Two Parker chips and two Pascal graphics processing units (GPUs) run the Drive PX 2 system for self-driving.Nvidia beat NXP to the market with its Drive PX 2 platform launch in January. But NXP has the largest share of any single player on the market, at 14.2%, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Gill wrote in a research report Wednesday.Infineon, Renesas (potentially attempting to acquire automotive-chip firm Intersil (ISIL)), STMicroelectronics (STM), Texas Instruments (TXN), Robert Bosch, ON Semiconductor (ON), Micron Technology (MU) and Toshiba each have 10% or less of the market, he said.The remaining 39% of the $27.4 billion global advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) market is made up of players with less than 1%. That's likely where Nvidia lands. But Nvidia won't stay there for long, Gill predicts.""Capitalizing on the trend toward connective self-driving cars, Nvidia is well positioned to gain not only market share, but also increase its (average sales prices) as autonomous applications should command a higher premium than infotainment computing,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Mobileye, too, is shoring up its autonomous-driving offerings by partnering with Delphi, the company said Tuesday. The duo plans to release a Level 4/5 automated driving system to integrate into vehicles in 2019.Parker chips are scalable and can be used to host infotainment, digital instrument clusters and ADAS platforms. Drive PX 2 synthesizes information from sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle information, high-definition mapping and algorithmic processing.Together, that's enough for Level 5 automation, which can run a vehicle without any human intervention. The market is largely focused on Level 2 and 3 automation, which can handle adaptive cruise control and parking assistance, among other functions.But tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have big dreams for full automation. During the recent Intel (INTC) Developer Forum in San Francisco, the No. 1 chipmaker delved deeper into its partnership with BMW (BMWYY) and Mobileye (MBLY) for autonomous driving.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock was down a fraction, above 62.50, but its shares have soared more than 75% the past three months, and it's an IBD 50 stock.

Shares are up more than 80% this year.But Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill says Nvidia stock is trading at a premium. To justify that, Gill says he would need to see 15%-20% core growth in 2017, but he only models 11%. He retained his hold rating on Nvidia stock.Others were more bullish. ""Tough to find much (bearish) to pick on here,"" Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay said of Nvidia's fiscal Q2. Ramsay kept his buy rating on Nvidia stock but boosted his price target to 70 from 67.50.""We maintain our belief that Nvidia's transformation from a PC-leveraged GPU supplier to a diverse visual-computing company is essentially complete,"" he wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, but so do five other companies in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, including Apple supplier Broadcom. Broadcom completed its Avago merger earlier this year and may be looking to punch its M&A card soon.For fiscal Q2 ended July 31, Nvidia reported 40 cents earnings per share on record sales of $1.43 billion, up a respective 700% and 24% vs. the year-earlier period. Those metrics easily topped analysts' model for 37 cents and $1.35 billion.Nvidia's gaming unit brought in $781 million, growing 18%. There, Nvidia still has a major runway with the new Pascal 1070/1080 GPUs still ""an immaterial percentage"" of the mix, and the circa-2015 Maxwell predecessor only at 33%, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh says.Gaming units have grown at a 9% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. Meanwhile, average sales prices have surged 11%, Rakesh wrote in a report. He kept his buy rating on Nvidia stock and lifted his price target to 66 from 60.Data center and automotive sales outgrew Nvidia's bread-and-butter segment, up 110% and 68% vs. last year, though only comprising 11% and 8% of total sales, respectively. Nvidia sees a $5 billion opportunity in its data center segment, Rakesh said.RBC analyst Mitch Steves forecasts 20%-30% growth for Nvidia's data center sales in fiscal 2017. The segment targets hyperscale cloud users like Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA), but 50% of the segment's sales in fiscal Q2 were for machine-learning.""Previously, we held a bullish stance on virtual reality with the automotive segment acting as a 'call option' on the stock,"" Steves wrote in a report. ""The company now has a second leg to run on and a growth profile that suggests 20%-30% in fiscal 2017.""Nvidia also expanded to 80 carmakers experimenting with its advanced driver-assistance system. The Drive PX 2 fuses radar, lidar and cameras for semi-autonomous driving. But the segment is bound to see some unfettered competition, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a report.""We note headlines on an autonomous driving partnership between BMW (BMWYY), Mobileye (MBLY) and Intel (INTC); Intel acquiring Nervana and Apple (AAPL) acquiring Turi for deep learning,"" he wrote.Alphabet (GOOGL) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are also working in autonomous driving.But main GPU rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is ""more constrained and resource-challenged,"" Ing said.He maintained his buy rating and 70 price target on Nvidia stock.

Autonomous driving isn't a ""Jetsons"" trope. It's here.Using Nvidia's Drive PX platform for self-driving cars, BB8 learned over 72 hours and 3,000 miles how to navigate dirt roads, circumvent traffic jams and avoid pedestrians. And BB8 did it all using a graphics-chip-powered supercomputer.This isn't your daddy's GPU.Traditionally, graphics processing units are mostly installed in desktop and laptop computers to handle heavyweight image rendering for gaming, including games used with Facebook's (FB) virtual-reality headset Oculus Rift. But Nvidia isn't about to stop there, says Danny Shapiro, the company's automotive marketing director.""We've taken our GPUs for non-graphics operations: hyperscale computing, scientific discovery, molecular modeling, drug discovery, cancer research,"" Shapiro told IBD. ""Any kind of high-performance computing needs, people are turning to our GPUs to do that. We're filling data centers.""Nvidia counts Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook, IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Twitter (TWTR) among its customers. Its chips, says Huang, already have achieved ""superhuman"" levels of artificial intelligence. The company also partners with Tesla Motors (TSLA) vs. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ford (F) in the nascent self-driving-car battle.Investors like the road ahead: Nvidia stock touched a record high above 48 on June 20, and it's been in the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks.The GPU opportunity in autonomous vehicles?""It's going to be huge,"" Shapiro said in an interview. ""The reality is, it's really transformative.""In 2019, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra estimates the automotive semiconductor market will reach $28 billion, at a 6% compound annual growth rate, on sensor and radar chips alone. That doesn't include GPU sales -- and while Nvidia doesn't make sensors or radar chips, that gives a clue about the potential size of this market.MKM analyst Ian Ing agrees that the GPU car market will be massive. And Nvidia really is the pole-sitter here.Top GPU rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- which declined to comment during its quiet period ahead of its Q2 earnings release on July 21 -- is largely entrenched only in the gaming sector, Ing told IBD. And Intel's (INTC) GPUs are often panned as inferior for desktop gaming, though the No. 1 overall chipmaker also focuses on smartphone and tablet GPUs.The competition among tech and car companies to develop a truly autonomous, mass-marketed vehicle continues to heat up. Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Ford are among the companies striving for the secret sauce. Regardless of who wins, machine learning is a necessity for autonomous driving, Ing says.""The Google Cars in Mountain View (Calif.), if you program them to exactly follow the rules of the road, they actually cannot drive effectively because they're dealing with all the human drivers,"" Ing said. ""Human drivers won't let them merge into traffic ... or give proper distance.""They need to adjust and adapt, and effectively learn how to get from Point A to Point B.""And that's the goal of Nvidia's autonomous-driving platform, coined as ""Drive PX 2."" It's powered by two systems-on-a-chip (comprised of a GPU and a central processing unit) and two additional bleeding-edge GPUs. That system is the power equivalent of 150 Apple MacBook Pros, says Sean Wix, Nvidia technical market manager.Drive PX 2 runs data compiled by 12 cameras as well as lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors through what the company calls DaveNet. That's Nvidia's deep neutral network software for autonomous driving. The software has been integrated into the Drive PX 2 platform and trained to operate a car.Nvidia's Shapiro says PX 2, launched in January, outperforms PX 1 by a factor of 10.Shapiro likened DaveNet's training to that of a child. DaveNet builds its ""vocabulary"" through pictures. But pictures, to a computer, are just pixels until logic is applied. The traditional system of computer programming via a series of ""if"" and ""then"" options isn't optimal for driving, he says, because there is just too much randomness in driving.""Deep-learning lets us train the vehicle how to interpret and pick the right action based on teaching it the experiential data,"" he told IBD. And unlike human drivers, ""our cars aren't going to speed, they're not going to text, they're not going to be drunk.""That should cut way down on wrecks, Shapiro says. He estimates 90%, or more, are caused by human error.Nvidia has some competition in the form of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) by Xilinx (XLNX) and Intel (via its Altera acquisition), but MKM's Ing doesn't see the ""smaller design community"" gaining much traction vs. GPUs. Unlike GPUs, which use software to learn, FPGAs are a hardware solution.Still, Xilinx has shipped 100 million devices to automotive and transportation customers, says Baird's Gerra. Xilinx's FPGAs support real-time analytics, video processing and displays, data transport and integration for advanced driver assistance systems.Nvidia supplies GPUs for six of the so-called Super 7 cloud service players -- Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA) (but not Tencent (TCEHY)). That's a major boon, says MKM's Ing, but it's difficult to completely size the market opportunity.""These deep-learning boxes (for data centers that power cloud systems), you're talking about tens of thousands of dollars of content per box and eight or nine high-performing GPU cards at a couple thousand dollars each, maybe $20,000 to $30,000 per box,"" he said.Initially, Nvidia's artificial intelligence opportunity is in the cloud, Ing says. Beyond that, he expects virtual reality to take a strong foothold in 2017, with autonomous driving following in 2018. Baird's Gerra has a 2018-2022 target for efficient self-driving vehicles.Gaming is really the market where AMD competes with Nvidia, Ing says. AMD's GPU prices have held up better during the recent gaming refresh than Nvidia's, he said in a June 7 research report. Nvidia customers are experiencing shortages after the company's Pascal architecture launch on May 27.Still, gaming remains Nvidia's bread-and-butter segment and will continue to be so amid the artificial intelligence and autonomous driving race, Shapiro told IBD. In Q1, gaming represented more than half of Nvidia's total sales, with data center and automotive at 11% apiece.Although data center and automotive sales accelerated 47% and 62.5%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter, Shapiro sees gaming remaining key for Nvidia.Unlike PCs, gaming is growing, and the VR opportunity is colossal.""Gaming is still a big part of our company, and it still continues to grow despite the fact the PC industry is shrinking, and despite the fact other companies are laying off people in droves,"" Shapiro said. ""Our gaming group is growing.""Nvidia shares fell 5.7% on the stock market today after hitting a record high on Thursday. Apple closed down 2.8%. Alphabet lost 4.15%, setting an 8-month closing low.

48,PX,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) developed a supercomputer capable of performing 24 trillion operations per second -- that's more powerful than 150 Apple (AAPL) Macbook Pros -- and it will run autopilot-capable vehicles in 12-18 months, Nvidia told IBD on Thursday.Nvidia imagines a $6 billion to $10 billion automotive opportunity, RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves said Thursday in a research note. Of that, $2 billion will be in the digital cockpit, $2 billion in self-driving cars and $2 billion to $6 billion on transportation-as-a-service.Steves boosted his price target on Nvidia stock to 47 from 40.Canaccord analyst Matthew Ramsay, too, upped his price target on Nvidia stock, to 55 from 45, noting that the company's four target growth areas -- gaming, enterprise, data center and automotive -- now comprise 90% of non-royalty revenue.""We maintain our belief Nvidia's transformation from a PC-leveraged GPU (graphics processing unit) supplier to a diverse visual-computing company is now complete,"" Ramsay wrote in his research note Thursday. He sees Nvidia hitting $3.50 earnings per share ex items in fiscal 2021, even as it battles Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL) for the nascent self-driving car market.Despite those bullish views, Nvidia stock closed down 1.75% at 46.72 on the stock market today. Shares are up about 44% for the year, though, after Nvidia launched its new gaming architecture, Pascal, and its second-generation self-driving platform.Nvidia launched its Drive PX 2 platform for autonomous driving in January, and it outperforms its first-generation cousin by a factor of 10, Danny Shapiro, Nvidia's senior director of automotive, told IBD in a recent interview. Four months later, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) launched its rival platform, BlueBox.BlueBox can deliver 90,000 DMIPS (million instructions per second). Explains Shapiro: ""That's like 90 giga instructions per second. We're at 24 tera instructions per second, or 24,000 giga instructions per second.""Most of Nvidia's automotive sales stem from Drive CX, its digital cockpit and infotainment system, Steves wrote. In the long term, Nvidia expects Drive PX 2 to displace CX as its top seller. And Nvidia is still investing in fully autonomous vehicles.In virtual reality, Nvidia forecasts a 3 million unit opportunity expanding at a 52% compound annual growth rate to 16 million units by 2020, Steves wrote. Nvidia's GPUs are suggested for use with Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift VR system.Only about 20% of Nvidia's GeForce installed base, 80 million units, has updated to VR-capable GPUs, Ramsay wrote in his report. And GeForce, Nvidia's gaming GPUs, has only penetrated about 10% of the emerging market.As such, ""we believe the Nvidia gaming franchise is well positioned for sustained strong low-teens growth, catalyzed by the launch of Pascal,"" Ramsay wrote.But rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will scoop 30% of Nvidia's discrete GPU market over the next several years on its Polaris launch, Ramsay wrote. Discrete GPUs don't have an integrated central processing unit. Nvidia will continue to hold the premium PC market, he predicts.

Nvidia continues to benefit from robust PC gaming vs. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and increasingly varied uses for its graphics processing unit (GPUs), she wrote.But Nvidia is far from alone in the autonomous car race. Last month, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) unveiled its self-driving engine, BlueBox. The company is aiming for complete vehicular autonomy by 2020.Unlike Nvidia's GPU-run Drive PX 2, NXP's system uses a central computing engine. MKM analyst Ian Ing says GPUs -- traditionally used to quickly render PC images for gaming -- are better positioned to tackle ""homogeneous and repetitive computing.""Nvidia says its platform uses ultrasonic sensors to produce a 360-degree visual. The company expects incremental adoption over the next five years. Van Hees notes Audi's A8 model next year will use Nvidia products.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Nvidia stock was up 1%, to 47.36. Shares have jumped 42% the past six months vs. 5% growth in IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group as a whole.

69,PX,"Nvidia (NVDA) received a downgrade Monday from an analyst who is bullish about the chipmaker's technology but concerned about the expiration of a six-year licensing deal with Intel. Goldman Sachs analyst James Covello in a research report today downgraded Nvidia to sell from neutral ""ahead of a licensing cliff and slowdown in core markets."" He has a price target of 20 on the stock.Nvidia stock was down about 3%, near 23, in midday trading in the stock market today. Nvidia stock has climbed 11% over the past 90 days.Intel (INTC) and Nvidia signed a six-year cross-licensing settlement in 2011 in which Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion in licensing fees.Covello says if the licensing agreement isn't renewed, Nvidia will see ""a step down in earnings per share (30% of earnings before interest and taxes), GPU (graphics processing unit) growth is likely to decelerate this year given near-term risks to personal computer original equipment manufacturer sales (20% of total) and gaming growth will likely normalize lower.""He expects Intel's final cash payment to be made in January 2016.""We believe the market has become complacent about the risk of Intel licensing revenue going away (with fewer sell-side analysts highlighting licensing in analyst day takeaways),"" Covello said. ""Our SanDisk (SNDK), Qualcomm (QCOM) and pharma case studies suggest stocks see 15% to 60% multiple compression going into binary events where licensing/patents are in jeopardy. We believe the near-term catalyst to refocus investor attention on longer-term normalized EPS will be weakness in PC fundamentals (which Nvidia noted it is not seeing at its analyst day).""Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia supplies high-speed graphics cards for computer gaming, and it has diversified and grown its products to help build the car of the future and enable high-performance and cloud computing more broadly.Its sophisticated platform for computerizing cars got a lot of discussion at Nvidia's analyst day last Tuesday, and its GPU Technology Conference, where Elon Musk, CEO of partner Tesla Motors (TSLA), showed up.Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang introduced the Nvidia Drive PX, called a deep-learning platform for self-driving cars. It's based on two Nvidia Tegra X1 processors and uses input from 12 cameras. It's coming out as a developer kit in May 2015 for $10,000 to qualified buyers, the company says.Covello says the weakness of PCs could drive investors to re-evaluate Nvidia's progress in diversifying and focus on its core segments tied to PC OEMs, gaming and workstations.""While we believe the market it giving the company significant credit for its diversification progress, auto remains less than 5% of revenue, compared to the 55% of Nvidia's EBIT that is tied to the PC ecosystem (including PC OEMs),"" he said.RELATED: Chipmaker Nvidia Rolls Out Videogame Console.

104,PX,"It didn't take long for a major buyout to have a positive impact on Minerals Technologies' financial results — or for Wall Street to take note of the specialty mineral producer's blowout third quarter.Minerals Technologies (MTX) shares rose 20% over a six-session period beginning on Sept. 24 — setting new closing highs each session and ending at a closing peak of 76.71 on Oct. 31 — after the company sprinted past Q3 earnings views and saw its revenue more than double from the prior year.A big driver of the gains was its May buyout of Amcol International, an Illinois-based producer of bentonite clay.That $1.7 billion deal came after Minerals Technologies won a bidding war for Amcol against Imerys, a French industrial materials firm. The addition of Amcol fattened the top line and widened the company's footprint into new geographies and product categories.Paper ChaseThe business of MTI — short for Minerals Technologies Inc. — includes five segments: Specialty Minerals, Refractories, Performance Materials, Construction Technologies and Energy Services.It is probably best known as the world's largest producer of precipitated calcium carbonates (PCC) used in the manufacture of paper. The PCC business accounted for 47% of MTI's revenue in 2013.The Amcol acquisition expanded MTI's business on a couple of fronts, CEO Joseph Muscari told IBD: ""It gives us more diversification in minerals, so we are staying close to what we know. It also helps us from a geographic expansion standpoint. We're able to do more in terms of leveraging the resources we have in India, China, Thailand, Indonesia and South America.""The addition of Amcol helped MTI deliver what Muscari called its ""highest quarter ever."" MTI dates back to 1992, when it was spun off from Pfizer (PFE).On Oct. 23, MTI logged Q3 earnings of $1.25 a share, up from 63 cents the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Sales more than doubled to $543.5 million.In a research note, JPMorgan analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas said MTI's operating income of $76.8 million exceeded his own forecast of $69.8 million, reflecting a ""better-than-expected operating performance and cost synergies in the acquired Amcol divisions.""MTI is about nine months ahead of schedule in terms of cost savings from the Amcol buyout, Zekauskas noted. Much of the work ahead will be focused on improving Amcol's operations. ""We believe there is a large runway for (MTI) to improve business processes across the company,"" he said. ""The Amcol plants run at very low levels of capacity utilization, and overhead costs are relatively high.""CEO Muscari said the sharp rise in MTI's stock price following its Q3 earnings release was partly due to the way it has handled the Amcol acquisition: ""We hadn't done an acquisition of this size before, so investors could see we were able to do it very well — that synergies were falling to the bottom line. Over the next two to three years we are going to be very focused on integrating Amcol and capturing all the synergies.""MTI also eyes big things from Amcol's main product. Bentonite boasts a diverse number of end uses that range from cat litter to construction products and bondings for metal castings.The latter category shows particular promise, Muscari said, particularly in China: ""China is the largest casting producing market in the world, and (Amcol) has a good market share there. As the China market continues to grow, we will grow with it.""More than half of MTI's 2013 revenue came from the U.S., while 27% came from Europe and Africa. Although Asia markets contributed only 11% of the total, that figure is likely to move much higher in coming years as MTI looks to grow its presence in the region.""China and India are at the top of the list in terms of geographic expansion, along with Southeast Asia and Brazil,"" Muscari said. ""We have been in China since the '90s, so we have very well established management there. In India, we didn't even have a position at all in paper PCC four years ago. Today we have a relatively high market share for paper makers there.""R&D EffortsOne way MTI boosts its market share is through product development, particularly in its PCC business. The company's research and development efforts focus on helping customers save money, produce higher quality products and reduce pollution.Muscari points to MTI's Fulfill brand of high-filler technologies.

142,PX,"Investors interested in Chemical - Diversified stocks are likely familiar with Air Products and Chemicals (APD  -  Free Report) and Praxair (PX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Air Products and Chemicals has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Praxair has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that APD is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.APD currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.16, while PX has a forward P/E of 22.83. We also note that APD has a PEG ratio of 1.30. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.99.Another notable valuation metric for APD is its P/B ratio of 3.19. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PX has a P/B of 6.43.These metrics, and several others, help APD earn a Value grade of B, while PX has been given a Value grade of D.APD is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that APD is likely the superior value option right now.

143,PX,"We issued an updated research report on Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) on Jun 1.With approximately $44.9 billion market capitalization, this industrial gas producer and supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), a revision from its earlier Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock’s investment appeal is further accentuated by a VGM Score of B.It’s worth mentioning here that in June 2017 Praxair signed an agreement to merge with Linde AG. The all-stock transaction currently awaits regulatory approvals and is anticipated to be completed in the second half of 2018. The resultant company is believed to be a leading industrial gas company with strong international presence, a large customer base and solid financial flexibility.Let’s delve deeper and discuss why investors should consider adding Praxair’s stock to their portfolio.Financial & Share Price Performances, Earnings Estimate Revision: Praxair’s financial performance has remained better-than-expected for quite some time now. Earnings beat of 5.77% for the first quarter of 2018 marks the company’s fourteenth consecutive quarter of impressive results. Also, over the same period, earnings have grown from $1.57 per share to $1.65 in first-quarter 2018.Solid financial results have been one of the reasons for the company’s stock price rally of 4.6% in the last three months. This return comfortably outperformed 1.8% decline recorded by the industry and 1.2% fall in the Zacks Basic Materials sector.Also, in the last 60 days, the company’s earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have been increased by seven and five brokerage firms, respectively. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.76 for 2018 and $7.36 for 2019, representing growth of 1.8% and 2.2% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Favorable Operating Conditions: We believe that strengthening U.S. economy — evident from healthy growth in GDP, rise in industrial production, improving housing market, increasing job additions and many more — as well as healthy growth prospects of the global economy, will spur demand for industrial gases.Also, growing applications of industrial gases — especially that of hydrogen in the refining industry, oxygen in healthcare, and nitrogen and carbon dioxide in oil and gas industry — has been beneficial for Praxair. Moreover, gas-supply contracts with Samsung, Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) and many more, as well as solid backlog of $1.5 billion while exiting the first quarter of 2018, underpin preferences for the company’s products.Dividend Payments: Praxair is an ardent believer of rewarding shareholders handsomely, especially through dividend payments. Over the last five years, its annual dividend rate has increased 31.3% from $2.40 per share in 2013 to $3.15 in 2017. After the 5% hike in quarterly dividend rate announced in January 2018, the company’s annual dividend rate stands at $3.30. Also, the company’s dividend payout rate has grown from 40.5% in 2013 to 53.8% in 2017.Solid Growth Prospects in the Near and Long Term: Strengthening end markets, sound product portfolio, rise in global industrial production and project wins are few factors that will drive Praxair’s growth in the quarters ahead. The company anticipates earnings of $1.67-$1.72 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The projection reflects year-over-year growth of 14-18% and includes 5 cents gain from the recent tax reform in the country.Moreover, in the next three to four years, the company anticipates delivering annual earnings growth of 3%, on the back of solid backlog and potential growth opportunities.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the industry are Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year and the next year. Also, average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 7.02% for Celanese Corporation and 8.23% for FMC Corporation.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

151,PX,"Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens.The industrial gas producer and supplier performed well in the last four quarters. Average earnings surprise was a positive 3.00%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.52 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.70%.In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 4.7% return, outperforming the decline of 2.8% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement. Factors to Affect Q1 ResultsWe believe that Praxair’s growth opportunities are directly correlated with industrial activities in the United States and that of the foreign nations it serves. Available data for few economic indicators clearly reflect that operating conditions were quite favorable for industrial companies in the first quarter of 2018. Industrial production grew at an annual rate of 4.5% while the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index for March pointed toward an expanding manufacturing sector. Growing U.S. housing markets, along with expanding domestic and world economy, support growth of industrial stocks.For the North America segment, Praxair will gain from rising demand for gases for industrial use, especially in the metals, chemicals, downstream energy and manufacturing end markets. Also, the company’s efforts to expand business in non-industrial areas will be fruitful. In this regard, long-term agreement (signed in January 2018) to supply nitrogen to EverDisplay Optronics' AMOLED (6th generation) project is worth mentioning.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the North America segment’s revenues stands at $1,552 million for the first quarter, above $1,542 million recorded in the previous quarter. Also, the segment’s average sales surprise for the last two quarters was a positive 2.61%.For South America, a lot depends on the political uncertainties in Brazil that have somewhat stalled the growth prospects in the region. However, Argentina seems a decent market for the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the South America segment’s revenues stands at $383 million for the first quarter, above $370 million recorded in the previous quarter.For the Asia segment, growth in demand for gases for the use in electronics end market, especially by Chinese and Korean customers, is believed to be a boon. For the Europe segment, manufacturing and metals industries are demanding more industrial gases.Praxair anticipates increasing its margins on the back of favorable pricing and volumes in the first quarter of 2018. Earnings are anticipated to be $1.53-$1.58 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12-15%. This projection includes 5 cents of gain from the latest tax reform in the country. However, seasonal weakness, due to Carnival and Lunar New Year as well as slower activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast, might slow down the growth momentum. Earnings WhisperOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release earnings results.

155,PX,"Industrial gas producer and supplier Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In each of the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results. Average earnings surprise was a positive 1.46%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.46 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.10%.In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 14.2% return, outperforming the gain of 11.9% recorded by the industry. Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement. What’s Affecting Q3 Results?Praxair sources more than 60% of revenues from its North and South American operations. This has made the company’s financials highly susceptible to economic or political uncertainties in these regions. For the second half of 2017, the company believes that customer demand in the United States will be below expectations while economic conditions in South America will continue to suffer from political tensions. Europe will likely remain stable.Adding to the concerns is the adverse impact of the hurricanes in the United States on the demand of Praxair’s industrial gases. Also, the company faces headwinds from adverse movement in foreign currencies, geopolitical issues, rise in production costs and industry competition.Moreover, Praxair’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 58.5% in second-quarter 2017. We believe, if unchecked, higher debt levels might increase the company’s financial obligations and hence, prove detrimental to its profitability. Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

156,PX,"Benchmarks closed in the red for the third consecutive trading day on Wednesday following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. President Trump is expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly. Shares of Dow component Boeing declined after investors fretted that a possible trade war between the two biggest economies may push China to retaliate, which may adversely affect the company. Boeing’s performance weighed on broader markets, with the Dow registering a one-day decline of around 250 points.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, or 246.74 points, to close at 24,758.12. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,749.48. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,496.81, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.9% to close at 16.99. A total of 6.53 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.14 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trump To Initiate Trade War With China?Per U.S. Census Bureau data, the United States posted a trade deficit of $375 billion with China last year, which was two-thirds of the economy’s trade gap of $566 billion. In contrast, China registered trade surplus of $276 billion during the same period, which was also two-thirds of the second biggest economy’s trade surplus of $422.5 billion.Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit by $1 billion.  A White House spokesperson later clarified that the exact amount was around $100 billion. Additionally, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports,” with Chinese telecommunications, apparel and technology sectors likely bearing most of the brunt.Following this development, a trade war is likely to break out between the United States and China. Investors fear that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) might be the primary target of Chinese retaliation. The aircraft manufacturer projected last September that China may invest about $1 trillion over the next 20 years to acquire aircraft from the company.Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday, weighing on the Dow and the industrials sector of the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 1.1%, becoming the second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) fell 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3% and was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Two of its main components, DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) and Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) declined 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Praxair has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PPI Increase Less Than January’s, Retail Sales FallIn economic news, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods increased 0.2% in February. This increase was slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 0.1%, but fell short of January’s rise of 0.4%. Core PPI rose 0.2% in February, in line with January’s movement. Subdued PPI number along with in line consumer price inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year.Additionally, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month, in contrast to the consensus estimate of 0.4% increase. Retail sales fell for third straight month, indicating that consumer spending will fall in the first quarter of this year. However, core retail sales increased 0.1%, which are closely correlated with the consumer spending component of the GDP.Stocks That Made HeadlinesV.F.

157,PX,"On Feb 13, we issued an updated research report on premium agricultural chemicals firm Monsanto Company .Over the last six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 2.8%, as against the 3.5% loss incurred by the industry.Inside Story Increase in per capita income levels across emerging economies (like Brazil) and significant rise in global population have been escalating demand for food products. These, in turn, have been boosting sales for crop-yield enhancing products offered by companies like Monsanto.The company follows an innovation-based growth strategy, under which it introduces unique products and process technologies to help cultivators lower input costs and enhance crop yields. The company believes its new innovation investments as well as research and development deals will assist in driving top-line growth in the quarters ahead.Monsanto is currently progressing on 20 new research and development projects. The company believes innovative farming solutions produced through these programs will help farmers battle severe agricultural constraints such as drought, water scarcity, climatic changes, land availability issues, plant diseases, incidence of weeds, and insects. Moreover, the company’s business subsidiary — The Climate Corporation — and the BioAg Alliance with Novozymes are also inventing state-of-the-art crop-yield enhancing solutions for cultivators.In order to become the leading player in the global seeds, traits and agricultural chemical industry, Monsanto has joined forces withBayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report), through a $66-billion buyout offer.  The company believes that Bayer’s association will open up a number of opportunities and growth for Monsanto’s business.Monsanto believes when its Seeds and Traits and Climate FieldView platform will be combined with Bayer’s non-imitable crop protection trade, the competency of the former will go up in the hostile agricultural chemicals industry. Along with Bayer, Monsanto is aimed at propelling innovation for farmers around the world, develop advanced integrated optimized solutions for the cultivators and provide new offerings in the market which will be highly beneficial for farmers. Monsanto anticipates closing the transaction in early 2018, which is subject to customary closing conditions and awaits regulatory approvals. Bayer has also pledged to reimburse a high break-up fee of $2 billion to Monsanto, in case there is a deal blockage due to regulatory turmoils.We notice that Monsanto reported robust first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. Quarterly bottom-line results came in 95% higher than the year-ago tally and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9%. The company stated that this upside was primarily driven by healthy growth in South American business. Notably, the company anticipates to report stronger earnings in the upcoming quarters on the back of higher volume and pricing for INTACTA RR2 PRO soybeans in South America, gains secured from the Precision Planning business spin-off (closed on Sep 5, 2017) and increased glyphosate pricing.However, over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained unchanged for both fiscal 2018 and 2019, reflecting neutral sentiments.In order to boost competency in the market, Monsanto makes potential research and development investments. However, such expensive moves are currently adding up to its aggregate debt burden. We find that the company is highly leveraged with approximately $6.9 billion of long-term debt at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018. Increased debt, if unchecked, will increase the company's financial obligations and impact its profitability in the near term.In addition, commercial rivalry in the global seeds, traits and agricultural chemical industry has been significantly increasing. Intense competition exposes Monsanto to risks of market-share loss. This is because the successful launch of a product by any rival can substantially lower the market value of the existing products offered by the company. In order to lower the bargaining power of prospective end-users, Monsanto seeks to generate higher liquidity for research and development to fortify its product portfolio.Also, Monsanto’s cost and sales are highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. Weak agricultural products’ prices might weigh over the company’s near-term revenues and margins. Given that incomes of farmers are directly related to agro-product prices, lower prices are reducing farmers’ income, and adversely affecting their seed and chemical product-purchasing decisions, thereby hurting Monsanto’s top and bottom lines. For instance, soft corn pricing in North America might dampen Monsanto’s revenues in the upcoming quarters of fiscal 2018.Stocks to Consider Two better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Categorized Basic Materials Sectorare listed below:Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 4.68% over the last four quarters.Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) also carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company generated an average positive earnings surprise of 3% during the same time frame.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

158,PX,"U.S. economy has been on rally mode since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the Trump administration.Economic Scenario and Tax ReformUnited States’ GDP grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 3.2% in the previous quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the economy to register a growth rate of 3% in the final three months of 2017. However, U.S. retail sales grew 4.2% in 2017 compared with 3.2% in 2016, showing signs of a strengthening economy (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).     Moreover, Trump’s tax reform is expected to significantly benefit U.S. companies. Financials are expected to be among the major winners from the tax reform, as companies with a high effective tax rate are expected to have a significantly lower tax bill.Large-cap companies will be able to repatriate a significant portion of overseas earnings at a lower tax rate. For the sake of argument, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) announced its plans of bringing most of the $252.3 billion offshore cash back to the United States, following Trump’s tax reform. The repatriation is expected to generate a one-time tax payment of $38 billion (read: Profit From Apple's Big Plans With These ETF).Consumer Sentiment and InfrastructureComing to consumer sentiment, Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence increased to 125.4 in January compared with 122.1 in the prior month. It surpassed economists’ expectations of 123.1.Per a CNBC article, citing a statement by Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, ""Expectations improved, though consumers were somewhat ambivalent about their income prospects over the coming months, perhaps the result of some uncertainty regarding the impact of the tax plan,"" adding, ""Consumers remain quite confident that the solid pace of growth seen in late 2017 will continue into 2018"".Moving on to infrastructure, Trump addressed the need to rebuild America’s troubling infrastructure by a bipartisan agreement between the two parties. In his State of the Union Speech, Trump said, “I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs.”Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.It has AUM of $34.8 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year.

160,PX,"Industrial gas producer and supplier, Praxair Inc’s (PX  -  Free Report) proposed merger with Linde AG yesterday received a green signal from the Russian antitrust authority. As revealed by Linde plc — the company that will house the businesses of Linde AG and Praxair upon completion of the deal — the approval received was unconditional.   In a separate release on Oct 12, Praxair announced the signing of a long-term contract to supply industrial gases to Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation, a unit of Shanghai-based Huahong Group. Financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.We believe that market sentiments are positive for Praxair, as evident from 19.4% rally in its share price over the last six months. The stock has outperformed 16.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to over the same period. Praxair-Linde Merger DealPraxair signed a business combination agreement with Linde AG in June 2017. The proposed all-stock transaction will combine Praxair’s efficient operating model and Linde’s expertise in engineering and technology, creating a leading industrial gas company with a strong international presence, large customer base and solid financial flexibility.As agreed upon then, Praxair’s shareholders will be offered one share in the new company for each existing share while Linde’s shareholders can exchange each share with 1.54 shares in the new company. Praxair and Linde will each have 50% ownership in the new company.Based on 2016 results, the new holding company’s combined proforma revenues were approximately $29 billion while market capitalization was roughly $70 billion as of May 31. Incorporated in Ireland, the company will have 12-member board of directors and will be listed on both the NYSE and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard segment).The merged company is anticipated to benefit shareholders with realization of annual synergistic benefits of approximately $1.2 billion and cost reduction in a period of three years from closing of the transaction.Subject to pending closing conditions, the parties involved anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.Details of the Supply ContractPer the deal agreed upon, Praxair will supply nitrogen, high purity oxygen, helium and other gases to Shanghai Huali Microelectronics’ production base in Kangqiao Industrial Park. The company will build and operate two new air separation plants, with combined daily production capacity of 600 tons of nitrogen. Praxair anticipates the plant to start production in early 2018.Praxair’s association with Shanghai Huali Microelectronics can be dated back to 2010, when the former started supplying industrial gases to the latter under a long-term bulk supply contract.We believe such contracts reflect customers’ preference for Praxair’s products and will prove beneficial for its growth, going forward. Notably, the Shanghai Huali Microelectronics contract will strengthen the company’s foothold in China, particularly increasing its presence in the semiconductor end market.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of $40.4 billion, Praxair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

161,PX,"We issued an updated research report on industrial gas producer and supplier, Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) on Sep 26, 2017. This chemical stock is poised to benefit from solid long-term growth opportunities. The company’s earnings are projected to rise 11.5% in the next three to five years.In the first half of 2017, the company’s shares have yielded 14.5% return. In June, it signed a merger agreement with Linde AG to form a new holding company. The all-stock transaction will combine Praxair’s efficient operating model and Linde’s expertise in engineering and technology, creating a leading industrial gas company with a strong international presence, a large customer base and solid financial flexibility.However, exposure to headwinds might restrict Praxair’s growth momentum in the near term. Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Growth DriversSolid Demand and Contract Wins: We believe that increasing application of industrial gases in manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, food and beverages, and metal fabrication industries comes as a boon for Praxair. To leverage benefits from this, the company has constantly undertaken initiatives for developing new products and improving its gases distribution capabilities.Exiting second-quarter 2017, the company had a solid backlog of $1.4 billion, clearly reflecting customers’ preference for its world-class technology, high-quality products and gas supply services. Notably, in April, the company started operating a new air separation unit at its Burns Harbor pipeline system while in July, it started multiple air separation plants.Benefits From Diversified Business Structure: We believe Praxair is poised to benefit from its diversified customer base in the healthcare and petroleum refining; computer-chip manufacturing and beverage carbonation; fiber-optics and steel making; aerospace, and chemicals and water treatment. In addition to providing atmospheric and process gases, the company also designs, engineers and builds equipment that produces industrial gases for internal use and external sale.Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in building Praxair’s profitability over time. Notably, in second-quarter 2017, it derived nearly 53% of net revenues from its North American operations while roughly 14% were sourced from Europe, 15% from Asia and 13% from South America.Shareholders’ Return and Promising 2017 Guidance: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Praxair. In the second quarter, the company paid dividends totaling $225 million.For 2017, the company anticipates benefitting from a talented workforce, sound product portfolio and new project wins. It raised its earnings guidance to $5.63-$5.75 from the previous projection of $5.55-$5.80. Earnings are predicted to grow 3-5% year over year. Capital spending is expected to be nearly $1.4 billion.Headwinds Posing Threat to Praxair’s ProspectsRelation to Global Uncertainties: Difficult macro conditions might adversely impact activities in Praxair’s end markets as well as economic developments of countries where it serves. For instance, reduction in industrial volume, lower inflation impacting prices and lower merchant and packaged volumes affected operating margin of the South America segment in the second quarter of 2017. We believe that any persistent weakness in any of the end-markets served will adversely impact the company’s sales and profitability, going forward.For 2017, Praxair believes that customer demand in the United States will be below expectations while economic conditions in the South America will continue to suffer from political tensions. Moderate growth is anticipated in Asia while Europe will likely remain stable.Diversification Woes and Stiff Competition: We believe that Praxair’s geographical expansion has exposed it to risks arising from foreign currency movements and geopolitical issues. Also, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies implemented by local governments might restrict the company’s growth opportunities in foreign nations. In addition, the company faces stiff competition from other players in the industrial gas market. Some major players in the industry are Innophos Holdings, Inc. (IPHS  -  Free Report), Koppers Holdings Inc. (KOP  -  Free Report) and Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KRO  -  Free Report).Rising Debt Levels and Others: Praxair faces risks from high-debt levels. Exiting second-quarter 2017, the company had long-term debt of approximately $8.2 billion while its debt-to-capital ratio was 58.5%. We believe, if unchecked, higher debt levels might increase the company’s financial obligations and hence, prove detrimental to its profitability.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Exiting third-quarter 2017, the company had a solid backlog of $1.5 billion.In the fourth quarter, the company signed long-term agreements with BASF and Samsung to build and operate a new syngas processing plant and an air separation plant, respectively, for them. It has also won a long-term gas supply contract from GLOBALFOUNDRIES and Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation. We believe these contract wins will be beneficial for Praxair.In addition, we expect international diversification to increase Praxair’s profitability in the quarters ahead. Business in North America will get a boost from strengthening demand in various end markets while that in Asia will improve on the back of growing electronics end market and new project wins. In Europe, volume growth in food and beverage market will be advantageous. Praxair Surface Technologies business will benefit from the aerospace market.For the fourth quarter, Praxair expects earnings per share to be within $1.45-$1.50.

164,PX,"Industrial gas producer and supplier, Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) yesterday announced the expansion of its hydrogen supply contract with Motiva Enterprises LLC. Financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Motiva Enterprises — formerly a joint venture between Saudi Refining Inc. and Shell Oil Company — started operating as a fully owned subsidiary of Saudi Refining from May 2017. It is the owner of Texas-based Port Arthur Refinery, currently recognized as the largest refinery in North America with 600,000 barrels per day of refining capacity. It currently supplies petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and lubricants. Inside the HeadlinesPer the long-term agreement, Praxair will be supplying more hydrogen to Motiva for meeting the additional demand created from the expansion of a hydrocracker unit and diesel hydrotreater in the Port Arthur Refinery in 2016. Moreover, the additional hydrogen supplied will assist in other operations of the refinery as well.Demand for hydrogen in refineries has grown manifold, especially driven by the growing need for clean transportation fuels as air quality standards become strict. This industrial gas is primarily used for producing refined fuels from crude oil. It is also used as an agent in lowering the sulfur-content in diesel. Our TakeWe believe that increasing application of industrial gases in manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, food and beverages, and metal fabrication industries is an advantage for Praxair. This, along with the company’s initiatives for improving its products and services, has helped it win many contracts over time. Exiting third-quarter 2017, the company had a solid backlog of $1.5 billion.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has approximately $46.4 billion market capitalization. In the last three months, shares of Praxair have yielded 15.8% return, outperforming 9% gain of the industry it belongs to.Also, its earnings estimates for 2018 have been increased by two brokerage firms in the last 60 days. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is pegged at $6.30, reflecting growth of 0.8% from the tally 60 days ago.Praxair, Inc. Price and Consensus  Praxair, Inc.

165,PX,"The year 2017 has been challenging for Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report). The stock has tumbled 55.7% in the last twelve months compared with the industry’s decline of 25%. Armed with a worldwide presence, this specialty biopharmaceutical develops, manufactures, markets and distributes branded and generic specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products and therapies along with nuclear medicine products.However, the sales volume of Mallinckrodt’s lead drug Acthar declined while weaknesses in the generics segment still persist. This downside was driven by the payer environment faced by specialty drugs and the slump is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Additionally, the Dublin, Ireland-based company is also dealing with concerns related to Inomax. The company suffered a setback after a U.S. District Court invalidated 11 patents covering its second-largest product, Inomax.  We remind investors that in February 2015, Mallinckrodt along with subsidiaries had filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) following receipt of a January 2015 notice from the latter. The notice was regarding Praxair’s submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA containing a Paragraph IV patent certification with the FDA for a generic version of Inomax.Subsequently, in July 2016, Mallinckrodt had filed a second suit against Praxair following receipt of a Paragraph IV notice concerning three additional patents recently added to the FDA Orange Book regarding its ANDA for a generic version of Inomax. Thereafter, a third suit was filed in September 2016. Mallinckrodt now plans to appeal against the court decision and stated that Inomax has patent protection till 2018.The company’s generic segment continues to be soft as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which in turn hurts volumes as well as prices. Further adding to its woes, Mallinckrodt expects a double-digit decline in revenues from this segment in the near time. Also, continued sluggishness in this segment might adversely impact the company’s gross profit margin.In a desperate attempt, the company recently announced that it will acquire Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  with the aim of diversifying its portfolio. The Sucampo purchase will add two approved drugs namely, Amitiza and Rescula to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio. While the buyout makes sense to consolidate the company’s portfolio considering Amitiza’s potential, but it might not be enough to bail Mallinckrodt out of its current crisis.Mallinckrodt has always been on the look-out for acquisitions to expand/diversify its portfolio. Apart from small tuck in acquisitions, the company had earlier acquired hemostasis drugs – Recothrom Thrombin topical (recombinant), PreveLeak and Raplixa (fibrin sealant) – from The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report) and strengthened its growing hospital portfolio.But problems are far from over yet for Mallinckrodt as the company is also under the scanner for misuse of opioid drugs.Consequently, we believe investors should steer clear of this stock as of now.Zacks RankMallinckrodt carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

In addition, the company has hiked its facility fees by roughly 15%. Price changes for individual customers will depend on their contract provisions or products purchased.Praxair cited increasing costs of energy, distribution and labor as the reason behind the rise in prices of the industrial gases.A month ago, the company had announced up to 10% increase in helium prices for its bulk liquid helium customers across nations. The price hike will be effective Jan 1, 2018. The price increase will cover higher costs for crude and refined helium, higher distribution costs and investments to improve its helium operations.We believe Praxair’s margins and profitability is highly dependent on costs of sales and expenses, as any unwarranted increase in these will lower the margins and profitability and vice versa. Notably, in third-quarter 2017, the company’s margin profile suffered from higher costs of sales, increasing 7.8% year over year. Gross margin was down 10 basis points. Also, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.5% year over year.Despite such adversaries, increasing applications have been raising the demand for industrial gases over time, proving beneficial for companies like Praxair.

168,PX,"Shares of Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) have tumbled 55.1% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 29.2%. Dublin, Ireland-based Mallinckrodt is a specialty biopharmaceutical with a worldwide presence.

Mallinckrodt will discuss with the FDA to confirm the regulatory pathway to gain FDA approval and subsequently launch the IV formulation, expected by 2022, and the oral formulation, expected by 2024.While these recent acquisitions will expand the company’s portfolio, the decline in legacy product sales will adversely impact revenues.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMallinckrodt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked health care stocks in the same space are Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc.

169,PX,"The materials sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand. Manufacturing has been picking up pace globally and driving demand for metals.Cause for AppealOn Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote, which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required. Moreover, this has increased investor optimism about President Donald Trump delivering on his promises of greater infrastructure spending, which is expected to give a boost to the materials sector (read: GOP Nears Tax Reform: Buy These ETFs).Per the Commerce department, construction spending increased 0.3% in September on a monthly basis to $1.22 trillion. It grew 2% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, strong earnings performance has contributed to gains in the sector. U.S. economic fundamentals seem to be strong. GDP increased 3% annually in the July-September period compared with a 3.1% increase in the third quarter.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $4.4 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 25 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 68.7% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Chemicals, Containers & Packaging and Metals & Mining, with 72.9%, 13.2% and 9.2% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report), Monsanto Co.  and Praxair Inc (PX  -  Free Report) with 22.9%, 8.0% and 6.5% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 7, 2017).  The fund has returned 26.4% in a year and 18.0% year to date (as of Nov 7, 2017). XLB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (IYM  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Index. It has AUM of $967.3 million and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year. It has 50 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 66.5% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Diversified Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals and Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals, with 28.6%, 22.7% and 12.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 6, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are DowDuPont Inc., Monsanto Co. and Praxair Inc with 24.2%, 7.8% and 6.2% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 6, 2017). The fund has returned 28.7% in a year and 19.3% year to date (as of Nov 7, 2017). IYM has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineXLB is more popular than IYM, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, it also may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  However, IYM has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. IYM returned 1.3% more than XLB so far this year whereas in a year, IYM outperformed XLB by 2.3%. With growing developments in the sector, these ETFs are poised to offer great growth potential. However, since the factors driving growth in this sector are still exposed to a great deal of uncertainty, a more popular ETF like XLB might help alleviate some of the political uncertainties prevailing in the region.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

173,PX,"A few major chemical companies are scheduled to report their quarterly numbers on Jul 27. The chemical industry is back on track after bearing the brunt of the global economic crisis. Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on attractive, growth markets in an effort to whittle down their exposure to other businesses that are grappling with weak demand. The industry is also seeing a pick-up in consolidation activities -- exhibited by a wide swath of deals in the recent past -- as chemical makers are increasingly looking to diversify their business and enhance operational scale.While the industry remains saddled by several challenges including concerns over China’s economy and weak demand in the energy space, its momentum is expected to continue through 2017, supported by continued strength across key end-use markets, an upswing in the world economy and significant shale-linked capital investment.Strategic initiatives including continued focus on cost and productivity, operational efficiency improvement and expansion of scale through acquisitions should help chemical makers weather macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Overall Q2 earnings for the sector are projected to rise 1.5% while revenues are expected to increase 2.8%, based on the latest Earnings Outlook.We take a sneak peek at four chemical companies that are gearing up to report second-quarter results on Jul 27.The Dow Chemical Company  will report its results ahead of the bell. The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.98% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 99 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.01. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) stocks going into the earnings announcement.

Dow faces feedstock cost pressure which may continue to hurt its downstream margins. Moreover, higher maintenance costs may affect margins in its plastics business. Dow is also facing challenges in its agriculture business. Nevertheless, the company is gaining from cost-cutting and productivity actions and continued focus on consumer-driven markets, which should continue to support its results in the second quarter.

174,PX,"Industrial gas producer and supplier Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.The company’s financial performance in the last four quarters was impressive, with better-than-expected results in three and in-line results in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 1.67%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.37 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.01%.We believe that sound financial performance and growth prospects have lifted investor sentiments for the company. In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 8.08% return, outperforming the gain of 3.05% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement.What’s Influencing Q2 Results?We believe that Praxair is likely to leverage benefits from better operating conditions in the machinery industry in the to-be-reported quarter. Rise in demand for industrial machineries is likely to boost the need for industrial gases required in the various stages of manufacturing processes. In the second quarter, industrial production (a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country) increased 4.7% from the year-ago quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities. Also, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery improved 4.6% in the first five months of 2017.Also, encouraging foreign trade relations, investments for infrastructural developments and rise in consumer-end demand is expected to boost growth of machinery companies and hence, industrial gas providers like Praxair. In addition, the company’s contract wins and existing product portfolio as well as new products launched during the quarter, including a new beverage carbonation solution for restaurants and bars – XatCO2 – is likely to positively influence results.  For the second quarter, Praxair expects earnings in the range of $1.38–$1.43 per share. We believe that such tailwinds might support the company’s results in the quarter. On the flip side, exposure to headwinds like higher production costs, stiff competition, high-debt levels and forex issues might negatively impact Praxair’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Praxair will be able to pull an earnings surprise this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.

Price and EPS Surprise | Praxair, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Praxair has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider in the industry as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #1.

176,PX,"Earnings season is wrapping up and the bulls have reason to cheer. Since third quarter reporting began over a months ago, the last of the markets bearishness has faded and a new wave of buying has taken its place. Whether or not the rally is justified can be discussed in another piece, but one thing does stand; favorable third-quarter earnings reports have continued to stoke investor expectations. Over 92% of the S&P 500 companies have reported and positive EPS surprises outnumber negatives by better than 3:1. The median surprise is an impressive 3.3% and median growth thus far is 12.7%. 
"
177,PX,"The growth leaders continue to be Energy and Materials. Energy has shown much greater strength than expected, with median growth of 27.7% and a surprise ratio of nearly 5:1. Tougher commodity price comps havent hit the sector as hard as expected, and oil field service firms like Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have been picking up the slack for lagging E&Ps. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter however, it is clear that the sectors year over year growth is expected to lag, potentially dropping to just over 2%. Recall that last years fourth quarter results were so good that they prompted a congressional hearing. Thats a textbook tough comp. Also showing strength, the Materials sector boasts median growth of 21.9% and a healthy surprise ratio of over 2:1. Large upside surprises here came from Nucor (NUE) and Praxair (PX  -  Free Report). 
"
178,PX,"The growth laggard thus far continues to be Consumer Staples, with median growth of only 6.3%. This is more favorable than expected however, as the sectors surprise ratio is over 3:1, with a median surprise of 1.9%. The two earnings surprise leaders for the sector were Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report). Food firms Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report) and McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report) also posted double-digit surprises. The Financial and Telecom sectors are also lagging with single digit growth.

The ratio of firms with higher mean estimates to lower mean estimates was similarly strong at 1.73.
"
183,PX,"The upward revisions were very widespread, with every sector seeing more upward than downward revisions. Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Consumer Staples ratio is the laggard, coming in at 1.02. Two sector companies showing strong negative revisions over the past four weeks were Hersheys (HSY) and Whole Foods (WFMI). On the upside of the revisions story, Health Care remains at the front of the pack with an impressive ratio of 2.90. Big pharma continues to show strength, though the recent post-election sell-off has taken the industry down a bit. Over the last four weeks, Amgen (AMGN), Merck (MRK), and Eli Lilly (LLY) have all seen strong upward revisions.

185,PX,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio has continued its uptrend and remains above 1.0, at 1.21. This is extraordinarily important. With the economy slowing, housing in a free fall and the yield curve inverted, one can easily make an intellectually coherent case for a recession next year. However, there has never been a recession where earnings grow at anything close to a double-digit rate. This is the elephant in the room that must be explained by any recession predictor. There is no way that the expected growth rate will come down unless estimate cuts exceed estimate increases.
"
186,PX,"The bright point regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Materials. The sectors ratio has reached 2.30. Two positive revisions leaders in the sector are Freeport Copper (FCX) and Praxair. On the downside, Energy remains the 2007 revisions ratio laggard with a 0.66. For the S&P 500 as a whole the ratio of firms revised up to revised down was a healthy 1.25, although like the revisions ratio it was well below the stellar levels for this year.

"
188,PX,"On a full-year1 basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.7% and 12.8%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable (slight downward drift for 2007) over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.4% versus 9.7% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 9.7% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession. Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 above 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
189,PX,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. Countering this is the expensing of options this year. As recently as last year companies were allowed to use bogus intrinsic value accounting for stock options. In other words pretend that there was no cost to the company for making its executives extraordinarily rich in many cases. Now they have to realize that compensation is indeed an expense, which holds down reported earnings growth, even if there is no change in the economic earnings. Unlike some other earnings databases, our estimates fully include the effect of expensing options (which would explain why our numbers are somewhat lower than theirs).
"
190,PX,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 37% this year and approximately 17% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors   ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report),  and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report)   account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Industrial sectors combined.

"
197,PX,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
198,PX,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
199,PX,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.5%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.4% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
200,PX,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.7% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.7% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.7%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only half of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
201,PX,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.5% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 41.7% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.2x 2006, and 9.8x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 23.0x 2006 and 19.6x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.1x and 14.6x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.
"
202,PX,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report.1 We follow the convention of referring to the most recently reported full fiscal year as 2005, and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2006. There can thus be some shifting in the growth rates even for 2005 as not all calendar year firms have completed their fiscal years.
"
203,PX,"The third-quarter earnings season is coming to a close and it appears to be a layup win for the bulls. From the beginning there has been no doubt, as one positive surprise came in after another. And the trend has yet to let up. Nearly 89% of the S&P 500 companies had reported, and positive EPS surprises still outnumber negatives by over 3:1. The median surprise is an impressive 3.2% and median growth thus far is 12.3%. 
"
204,PX,"The growth leaders are the Energy and Materials sectors. Energy has shown much greater strength than expected, with median growth of 27.5% and a surprise ratio nearly 5:1. The tougher commodity price comps havent hit the sector as hard as expected, and oil field service firms like Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have been picking up the slack for lagging E&Ps. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, however, it is clear that the sectors comparable growth is expected to lag, potentially dropping to less than 1%. Recall that last years fourth quarter results were so good that they prompted a congressional hearing. Thats a textbook tough comp. Also showing strength, the Materials sector boasts median growth of 21.5% and a healthy surprise ratio of over 2:1. Big upside surprises here came from Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and Praxair (PX  -  Free Report).

205,PX,"The growth laggard thus far continues to be Consumer Staples, with median growth of only 6.3%.

However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
226,PX,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.4%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.4% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
227,PX,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.7% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.8% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.7%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only half of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
228,PX,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.6% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 38.7% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.5x 2006, and 10.1x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.4x 2006 and 19.2x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.8x and 14.4x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

230,PX,"We issued an updated research report on Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) on Mar 5. Strengthening end markets, efforts for improving products and services, and commitment toward rewarding shareholders make Praxair a good investment choice for investors seeking exposure in the chemical space.This industrial gas producer and supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has the market capitalization of approximately $43.9 billion. Its merger with Linde AG (signed in June 2017) in an all-stock transaction currently awaits regulatory approvals. Per the agreement, Praxair’s efficient operating model and Linde’s expertise in engineering and technology will create a leading industrial gas company that will have a strong international presence, a large customer base and a solid financial flexibility.Below we discussed why investors should consider adding Praxair’s stock to their portfolio.Share Price Performance and Earnings Estimate Revision: Praxair’s financial performance has been impressive in 2017 with better-than-expected results in all the four quarters. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3% over the said time frame. Solid results and improved operating conditions in the industry primarily supported the company’s share price rally of 35.1% in the year.Also, market sentiments have been positive for Praxair in the last month. The stock yielded 1.8%, outperforming the 2.2% decline of the industry. Underpinning the favorable sentiments reflects positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock. In the last 60 days, eight brokerage firms have raised estimates for 2018, while three firms have increased estimates for 2019. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $6.64 for 2018 and $7.20 for 2019, representing growth of 5.4% and 3.9% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Competitive Advantage: Diversified business structure has given Praxair a competitive edge over other players in the industry. It currently operates in four business segments — North America, Europe, South America and Asia — largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group. Also, a vast customer base in various end markets, including healthcare and petroleum refining; computer-chip manufacturing and beverage carbonation; fiber-optics and steel making; aerospace; and chemicals and water treatment, is a boon.Exiting 2017, the company had a solid backlog of $1.5 billion, clearly showing customers’ preference for the company’s world-class technology, high-quality products and gas supply services. Further, in the first month of 2018, Praxair’s hydrogen supply contract with Motiva Enterprises LLC was extended and a long-term gas supply agreement with China-based EverDisplay Optronics was signed.Shareholders Return: Praxair is committed to returning a higher value to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. It distributed dividend totaling $901 million in 2017 while repurchased shares worth $12 million. In January 2018, the company announced a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend rate.Impressive Near-Term Prospects: We believe that Praxair’s constant efforts for improving its products and distribution services as well as strengthening demand for industrial gases and related services will prove advantageous. Notably, industrial gases are being increasingly used in manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, food and beverages, and metal fabrication.For 2018, the company anticipates gaining from its solid product portfolio, strong end markets and new project wins. Also, new tax reform is anticipated to stimulate capital investments and benefit the company. Earnings in the first quarter of 2018 are projected to be within $1.53-$1.58 per share, reflecting  year-over-year growth of 12-15%. Also, it includes a 5 cents of gain from the recent tax reform in the country.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the industry are Methanex Corporation (MEOH  -  Free Report), Univar Inc. (UNVR  -  Free Report) and Cabot Corporation (CBT  -  Free Report). While both Methanex and Univar sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Cabot carries Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Methanex has reported better-than-expected results in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.11%. In addition, earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have improved over the past 60 days.Univar’s earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have improved in the past 60 days. Also, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.83% in the last four quarters.Cabot’s earnings surprise in the last four quarters has been a positive 3.68%. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 (ending September 2018) and fiscal 2019 (ending September 2019) have improved over the past 60 days.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

231,PX,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand.However, the relation between the United States and its trade partners is not so sweet right now, with fears of a potential trade war looming large. “We’ll be imposing tariffs on steel imports, and tariffs on aluminum imports. And you’re going to see a lot of good things happen,” Trump said. Trump’s America First agenda has sparked fears of a trade war, as he told steel and aluminum industry executives in a meeting about his intention to implement a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.Trump's tariff plan ""is bad policy at a bad time and will only add to the risk of a trade war,"" per a New York Times article citing Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.Into the HeadlinesTrump said the tariffs will be introduced as early as next week. However, it is not yet clear if any specific product or country will be excluded from the arrangement. American stocks for companies that use the metals took a beating as a result of this announcement.The U.S. measures “overturn the international trade order,” per a Bloomberg article citing Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. “Other countries, including China, will take relevant retaliatory measures,” Wen added.Japan voiced its concerns too. “Steel and aluminum imports from Japan, which is an ally, do not affect U.S. national security at all,” Japan’s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo. “I would like to convey that to the U.S. when I have an opportunity,” Seko added.American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices, as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below-market prices, thanks to the state subsidy they receive. However, America can expect retaliatory measures from China, as the emerging market nation is the largest producer of steel and aluminum. Amongst the biggest concerns, China is evaluating trade of soybeans and other farm products with the United States, which might weigh on American famers and ultimately on Trump’s support among rural Americans and Republican strongholds.Adding to the agony, if the tariffs lead to an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers who use these metals, they might have to pass on a certain percentage of the rise to consumers. This in turn will add on to inflationary pressures, at a time when Wall Street is already worrying about the impact that rising inflation will have on the markets.The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes. Therefore, at an already shaky time for Wall Street, Trump’s tariffs do no good to alleviate investor concerns about the markets (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on Post Fed Minutes).Let us now discuss ETFs that are expected to be impacted because of this announcement.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials’ stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $5.1 billion and charges a moderate fee of 13 basis points a year.

233,PX,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand. Manufacturing has been gathering pace globally and driving demand for metals.However, the scenario in the United States and among its trade partners is not that sweet right now. U.S. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross stated last week that the administration has got the green light to move ahead with proposed tariffs on metals and that President Donald Trump has until April to decide the future course of action around his protectionist agenda (read: Stave Off Rising Rates Anxiety With These ETFs & Stocks).Into the HeadlinesRoss recommended a possible global tariff of at least 24% on imports of steel and 7.7% on aluminium after careful consideration of all factors including import surges in recent years. Ross added that the current scenario threatens to impair the U.S. national security.  Per a Financial Times article, Wang Hejun, an official at China’s commerce ministry, said, “The spectrum of national security is very broad and without a clear definition it could easily be abused,” adding, “If the final decision from the US hurts China’s interests, we will certainly take necessary measures to protect our legitimate rights.”American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices, as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below market prices, thanks to the state subsidy they receive.As a result, Trump is expected to take a strict stand against this move, because he has been following his ‘America first’ agenda since his first day in office. Per a Financial Times article, in a meeting with Congress members, Trump said, “I want to keep prices down but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminium industry and we do need that for national defence,” adding, “If we ever have a conflict we don’t want to be buying steel [from] a country we are fighting.”If Trump moves ahead with his agenda, China in retaliation will need to carefully administer its moves, so as to not hurt its export dependent economy.InfrastructureMoving on to Trump’s infrastructure plans, the President unveiled his $1.5 trillion plan last week. However, a mere $200 billion of that will come from direct federal spending, whereas the rest is to be funded by state and local governments who are expected to match any federal allocation by at least a four-to-one ratio (read: Will Infrastructure ETFs Get a Boost from Trump's Plan?).Although the plan is still in its early stages, if passed, it will significantly benefit materials companies. ""For too long, lawmakers have invested in infrastructure inefficiently, ignored critical needs, and allowed it to deteriorate. As a result, the United States has fallen further and further behind other countries,"" Trump's message to the Congress read. ""It is time to give Americans the working, modern infrastructure they deserve,"" he added.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index.

238,PX,"The U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump had accused Canada of “charging massive tariffs” to U.S. businesses.The tiff involved France and Germany who criticized Trump’s decision to back out of the G7 communique. Trump, in the meanwhile, threatened to double auto tariffs, marring the G7 efforts to show a united front.   With Trump refusing to endorse the G7 communique, stock market gains are likely to be capped. In fact, more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Amid such ambiguity, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility.No Breakthrough at G7 SummitTrump’s stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7’s efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships. He specifically accused Canada of imposing a 270% tariff on dairy. This has forced many U.S. dairy products from making their way to Canada from the United States. Trump, in return, has decided to slap more import tariffs on the sensitive auto industry.Trump tweeted “PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’ Very dishonest & weak. Our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!”Meanwhile, Trudeau’s office added that the dairy tariffs were primarily a reaction to Trump’s decision to levy charges on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. Moreover, protective measures like Canada’s dairy tariff are very common throughout the world. Lest we forget, the United States has imposed tariffs to protect several of its industries, starting from the 350% tariff on tobacco to 160% on shelled peanuts.Trudeau said that Germany stood by the “jointly agreed communique” despite Trump’s decision to back out. France and Europe also continued to support the G7 communique and stated that anyone quitting the summit will be showing their “incoherence and inconsistency.”Historic Trump-Kim Summit, Central Bank MeetingsAmid the G7 trade spat, investors are keeping an eye on the much-talked-about meet between Trump and Kim in Singapore. The stakes are high as the summit marks the first time when both the leaders will meet in person to reach a denuclearization agreement on the Korean Peninsula.But, investors shouldn’t get their hopes up. Even if the meeting is successful, the stock market should brace for more gyrations as this week awaits outcome from central bank meetings.Time to Buy Dividend AristocratsSuch uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are facing gyrations.
