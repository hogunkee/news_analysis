7,FLT,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been on a tear lately. After putting in the bottom to its latest base in early April, the veteran chip stock has posted 10 up weeks in a row. It's hitting price levels not seen since January 2007.Judging from Monday's action, the buyers aren't tired yet.While the stock is now extended sharply past a 13.95 buy point in a large, deep double-bottom base, it may be worth keeping the stock on the watch list. Here are two reasons.One, a stock that rises that many weeks in a row is showing something special. Fund managers are serious about accumulating the stock. No wonder that AMD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also shot up to an A+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Two, fundamentals are getting white-hot at the Intel (INTC) rival in CPUs.Advanced Micro, which incorporated in 1969, ended two years of red ink by earning 13 cents a share last year.

Wait for the stock's first pullback to the 10-week moving average. This could take a while. The 10-week moving average is rising rapidly. But at 13.40, it's sharply below the current share price.A three-weeks-tight pattern would offer another potential follow-on buy point. But so far, there's no such formation.Elsewhere in stocks today, Estee Lauder (EL) cooled off on Monday after gaining more than 3% in each of the prior two weeks.

Shares are hovering just above the 10-week line — 3% away from the entry — as its earnings results loom.Edwards is the current leader in the $3.5 billion transcatheter aortic heart valve replacements, or TAVR, market.Earnings will be reported on Tuesday after the close.Payment processor and IBD 50 member FleetCor Technologies (FLT) is nearing a flat base's 213.87 buy point, but shares fell nearly 1% Monday. Still, the stock is holding nicely above its 10-week line after a breakout last November.A good flat base shows a decline of no more than 15% from the base's highest price.In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales growth increased 27% and 18%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. Quarterly earnings are due out April 30.Lastly, cybersecurity firm Okta (OKTA) is breaking out above a 42.99 cup-shaped base entry early Monday with an over-4% advance. Volume was tracking over 100% above average in midday trade.While the stock is performing well, the company has yet to show a profit after losing 67 cents per share in fiscal-year 2018, ended in January this year. Ideally, a stock should display both fundamental and technical strength, since strong earnings growth is normally the catalyst behind big stock moves.As the stock market uptrend continues, be on the lookout for which stocks are being added to and removed from IBD's stock lists to help pinpoint the potential leadership.Tip: Before making any investment decisions, be sure to check current market conditions, and use IBD Stock Checkup to see if your stock gets passing ratings for the most important fundamental and technical criteria.

17,FLT,"If an investor were to glance at MarketSmith's monthly chart of the credit-card stock group, an almost unbroken ascent is the rule.During the bull market, which began in 2009, the payment card and processing group has done very well. The group rose in price in each of the past nine years. The cumulative gain over the nine years is 718%.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 338% and 196% in the same period, according to MarketSmith data.So, individual investors might want to get some exposure to the credit-card stocks.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCincinnati area-based Vantiv completed the acquisition of London-based Worldpay (WP) in January, changing the merged company's name to Worldpay. Earnings are expected to grow 11% this year and 20% in 2019. Revenue growth is pegged at 82% this year and 9% next year.The market capitalization of Worldpay is roughly $25 billion and the company is carving a base with an 85.63 buy point. The stock is 4% off a new high.Georgia-based Fleetcor Technologies (FLT) is far along in a new consolidation. The stock is near a 213.84 buy point.Fleetcor's relative strength line is at a high, which is bullish. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. When the RS line hits a high before a breakout, that is especially bullish.Annual earnings grew 23% in 2017, the best gain in three years. Revenue also increased 23%.Fleetcor provides payment solutions to businesses. The company, which has a market cap of about $19 billion, partners with other firms such as Chevron (CVX), Uber and Sem Parar.

Bulls prefer to see a stock consolidate above that key support line.Global has a market cap of about $18 billion.Which of the three stocks is best? If an investor wants one quick test, the RS line at a high gives the nod to Fleetcor.Four stocks in the credit card space have gigantic market caps.Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and American Express (AXP) have market caps that are roughly three to 10 times bigger than the three payment stocks in the Big Cap 20.While the big four are not in the Big Cap 20, they deserve attention. Three are forming bases.Visa, Mastercard and American Express each have an RS line at a 52-week high.RELATED:Did Investors Over-React To The Warning On Chips?Why Stocks Build The Base-On-Base PatternWhat Leaders Can Tell You About This Market

Top retail stock Best Buy (BBY) is approaching a potential buy point in the stock market today.Earnings season remains in full swing, so investors should be vigilant about potential earnings results. Earnings releases usually result in volatile price changes, so ensure you have a decent profit cushion — at least 5% to 10% or more — to withstand any downside moves. Meanwhile, better-than-expected results can lead to breakaway gaps.Best Buy saw double-digit top-line growth in the most recent quarter — at 14% — for the first time in years. Meanwhile, year-over-year quarterly earnings growth is averaging 25% over the last three quarters. The next earnings report isn't due until late May, allowing investors time to build a position ahead of the volatile announcement — should the stock break out.Shares are less than 1% away from the conventional 78.69 buy point.

A previous breakout above a flat base's 56.35 entry triggered the 7%-8% sell signal, resulting in the new pattern.Shares are currently about 3% away from the buy point and could add a potential handle.Two weeks ago, the company reported strong earnings results, sparking the move back above its 10-week line and up the right side of a base.

80,FLT,"Doctors use stethoscopes, machines to analyze blood and urine samples, MRI scanners and other diagnostic machines to see what's wrong with patients. These devices are all part of the profession of medicine.When you invest in stocks, you also need to use the right tools.""Investors who train themselves to decode price movements on charts properly have an enormous advantage over those who either refuse to learn, just don't know any better, or are a bit lazy,"" wrote IBD Chairman William O'Neil in ""How To Make Money In Stocks.""While charts can be intimidating at first, with time and practice, you can learn how to properly interpret price and volume action on a daily and weekly basis. You will learn to recognize healthy and constructive action, as well as warning signals.Monthly charts can help you too. How? In some cases, you can easily count the number of bases that a true market leader has formed over a lengthy time period. The more bases a good stock forms before breaking out to new highs, the higher the chances that an end in the stock's growth cycle is near.Also, IBD has studied the best market winners during various bull cycles going back to the late 1800s and has found that many winners run for several years before going into a deep freeze in price. You just cannot gain that perspective from a daily chart.Monthly charts may also help you quickly identify a sharp break in a long-term downtrend in price, giving you a clue to be looking for a new base to form and a potential breakout to materialize.Learning to use charts is a must for investors who implement IBD's seven-step comprehensive methodology for selecting, buying and selling stocks, coined by O'Neil as CAN SLIM. While fundamentals are important, they don't tell you when to buy and sell. Charts can help you truly pinpoint your stock selection and timing.IBD charts, available within the ""Research"" section at Investors.com, shows price and volume action for an individual stock, exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a market index such as the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500.Prices are usually shown on the upper part on a chart, while volume — the number of shares traded — tends to lie below.The most popular is a bar chart, where each vertical line (or bar) represents trading activity for a certain time frame. Charts show action on a daily, weekly, monthly or even intraday basis.On a daily chart, the highest point on the bar shows the highest price traded for the day (1), as seen in this sample chart from FleetCor Technologies (FLT), a  superb winner from its breakout on Aug. 9, 2012; by November 2014, the fuel card expert for the trucking industry rolled 309% higher.The lowest tip of the bar shows the lowest price traded that day (2). The horizontal hash mark show the closing price (3). Some bars show a left-side hash mark indicating the opening price of a stock. For investing the IBD way, however, that information is not critical. The price close is far more important.Notice on FleetCor's chart that a solid black line runs across the bars that show the amount of volume traded in the stock each day. This line, calculated by taking the total volume over the 50 most recent trading sessions and dividing by 50, gives you a quick read on whether trading was heavy or light on any given session.Why care about that?In most cases, a good stock will show volume surge well above its 50-day average on the day of its breakout, or in the days and weeks soon afterward. Such spikes in price present you the fact that some large fund managers are urgently buying shares. Institutional buying over weeks or months is the secret sauce that makes breakouts to new highs the way to make money in stocks.Line charts only have a line connecting the closing prices. Candlestick charts, which originated in Japan, show relationships among the open, high, low and close of stock and index prices in a different visual format. Meanwhile, point and figure charts don't have a volume element. You don't need to use these additional types of charts to do well with IBD. Keep it simple.Once again, to see stock charts on Investors.com, hover your cursor over the Research tab, then click on ""IBD Charts.""Stocks will form bases or price patterns, which are your buy setups. But there are certain nuances in price and volume that make a base buyable or one that you should avoid. Investor's Corner is geared to help you learn the subtle differences between a good base pattern and a faulty one.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Jan. 8, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Sell Signals On A Stock Chart: When Multiple Signals Strike The Same DaySell Signals On A Stock Chart: How To Treat A Gap Down In PriceIBD University Course: How To Time Your Stock BuysIs It Time To Buy Stocks Now?

The former growth stock leader saw turnover surge more than six times usual levels and gave back all of its gains since an Aug. 3 breakout sent the stock past a 152.83 double bottom with handle buy point.The fuel card technology firm, serving the trucking industry, posted a 15% increase in earnings to $1.92 a share, narrowly edging the Street's view, as revenue rose 7% to $484.4 million.

It was the seventh quarter in a row of better than expected earnings growth.Analysts expected $1.11 EPS on $668.3 million in revenue.The company maintained its outlook for full-year revenue of $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, which would be up 8% to 10% from the prior year and about in line with consensus.Global Payments also raised its outlook for full fiscal 2015 EPS to $4.77-$4.84, or 16% to 18% growth over 2014, topping views for $4.78.CEO Jeff Sloan said the growth reflects ""our strategy to deliver technology-enabled payments solutions across an expansive direct customer base worldwide, while continuing to invest in future growth.""Among its recent growth initiatives, Global Payments on March 25 announced it had purchased Realex Payments, a Dublin-based payments company that provides a range of technologies for businesses selling online, for about $125 million.Like other payments processors such as MasterCard (MA), vehicle fleet payments card processor Fleetcor Technologies (FLT) and Visa (V), whose stock is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top performers, Global Payments is benefiting as more confident consumers and business step up credit card use.Visa reports Q2 performance April 30.Global Payments shares were up nearly 7% to 98.64 in heavy volume in afternoon trading in the stock market today.After consolidating in the first half of calendar 2014, its stock rose above the range and it's climbed 38% from an October low. It boasts an 89 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed 89% of all stocks on key metrics.Visa and MasterCard were both up about 1% and Fleetcor rose 0.5%.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

218,FLT,"Falling fuel prices are great for vehicle-fleet operators but not so much for fuel-card firms that get a cut on sales when customers swipe their cards at the pump.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) is one of the biggest fuel-card companies in the U.S. And it has a sizeable international business, thanks to acquisitions of local fuel-card networks.The Norcross, Ga.-based firm generates revenue from its payments network and card processing services for commercial and government fleets.The company charges fees to fleet operators that use its various fuel cards and a usage fee to gasoline companies that take the fuel cards.FleetCor and analysts who follow the firm remain upbeat about its prospects in the face of lower fuel prices in the U.S.For one thing, FleetCor generates much of its revenue from services that have nothing to do with prices at the pump.In addition to various fees, FleetCor offers productivity tools, fraud protection and fleet-maintenance management, among other money-saving services.What's more, a wide spread between the wholesale price of fuel and the retail price offsets lower fuel prices — at least in the near-term. While wholesale prices react quickly to oil-price changes, retail prices tend to follow more slowly.Profit From Price SpreadsThe spread, for now, offsets some of the negative impact from declining gas prices, acting as a kind of hedge, analysts say.Eric Dey, FleetCor's chief financial officer, said in a post-Q3 conference call that higher fuel-spread margins lifted North American revenue by $5 million in the quarter.Analysts from Evercore ISI noted in a research report earlier this month that the average spread between wholesale and retail fuel prices in the fourth quarter grew 40% year over year.Given the wide spread and a decline in foreign exchange headwinds, Evercore raised its Q4 forecast by three cents a share, to $1.38. That's two cents above analysts' consensus of $1.36. In the year-earlier period, FleetCor earned $1.08.Barclays' analysts also don't seem too fazed by the impact of lower fuel prices on FleetCor's financial health. Barclays has an ""overweight"" on the stock, and it notes, ""Long-term prospects outweigh short-term headwinds.""""We suspect that during 2015, investors will look through the gas price and (foreign exchange) impacts and instead look at normalized growth potential,"" analyst Darrin Peller of Barclays wrote in late December.FleetCor shares rose 27% in 2014 but are down 8% so far this year, however.The company's ""normal"" growth has been impressive. Revenue over the last four years has grown 26% annually on average, while earnings have gone up 36% a year on average over that time.Numerous acquisitions have fueled some of FleetCor's growth. In Q3, the three biggest deals from 2013 — in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil — accounted for about half of the company's revenue growth, CEO Ronald Clarke said in the last conference call.Total company revenue in the quarter jumped 31% to $295.3 million, while earnings per share rose 27% to $1.37.FleetCor has made more than 60 acquisitions since 2002. They include the recent $3.45 billion deal for Comdata, which closed in November and was its biggest buy ever.Comdata provides electronic fleet, virtual card and gift card solutions to more than 20,000 customers worldwide. Fleetcor management expects sizeable synergies, including cuts in fixed costs and cross-selling opportunities.Acquiring To GrowGoldman Sachs analysts see up to $1 billion of additional ""accretive"" deals this year.New acquisitions, organic growth and cost synergies from the Comdata deal ""will more than offset"" headwinds from weak fuel prices and negative foreign currency translations, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote after a meeting with management in mid-December.FleetCor's forecast for Q4 calls for earnings of $1.33 per share, assuming a foreign currency headwind of 5 cents. Analysts on average expect $1.36, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.For all of 2014, FleetCor raised its EPS forecast to $5.07-$5.11 from $5.04-$5.10 previously. The company also raised its 2014 revenue forecast slightly, to $1.1-$1.11 billion.For 2015, management kept its previous guidance for EPS of $6.35 at the midpoint, despite an expected $.15-$.20 EPS headwind from unfavorable foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.The 2015 EPS guidance implies a 25% gain from FleetCor's expected EPS for 2014.The CFO noted in the call that the Comdata business — yet to be acquired then — was doing better than expected and that financing costs were lower than thought.FleetCor's revenue is almost evenly split between North America and international, with faster growing North America slightly higher at 52.9% of the mix.North America revenue in Q3 jumped 35.6% vs. the prior year to $156.3 million, with organic growth of 19%.Double-digit growth in the U.K. fueled much of the growth on the international side, which saw revenue rise 26.4% to $138.9 million.Even FleetCor's business in ailing Russia was ""hanging in there,"" CEO Clarke said in the call. He and other executives declined an interview request.Maine-based rival WEX (WEX), formerly Wright Express, saw Q3 revenue grow 16% to $222.1 million. Earnings rose 17% to $1.56 per share, but analysts expect Q4 earnings to fall 1% from a year earlier.Its shares have fallen off sharply since late November.In IBD rankings, FleetCor is rated higher than WEX, with a Composite Rating of 93 vs. WEX's 74. The highest score possible is 99. The ratings factor in several metrics such as earnings growth and stock gains.Both stocks are in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing industry group, which is ranked 83 of 197 groups in performance.FleetCor is No. 3 in the group by Composite Rating, after Vantiv (VNTV) and Alliance Data Systems (ADS).

239,FLT,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

315,FLT,"Here's a short list of short lists of leading stocks.In May 2003, Investor's Business Daily launched the IBD 100. The feature each week zeroed in on 100 leading stocks — the best of the best among leaders, aimed at saving investors time by culling stocks with healthy fundamentals and chart action from the daily NYSE and Nasdaq listings.After much careful study, IBD tightened the list to the IBD 50 in January 2011. This more-refined offering had carefully explored which stocks among the eight years of IBD 100 lists tended to show the best performance.Keeping the strong, discarding the weak, IBD has concentrated its list down to even more fine-tuned leadership. The list is now published twice a week, on Monday and on Wednesday.The list continues to offer IBD's proprietary minicharts, jammed with critical fundamental and technical information on each stock, not the least of which are chart descriptions, including buy points and critical sell signals.As with any stock offering, readers should never buy a stock simply because it appears on the IBD 50. Remember, the IBD 50 is not a buy list. Treat it as a key watch list. You should always analyze the chart pattern, dig deeper into the fundamentals and read articles about the company to understand fully what sets it apart from the thousands of also-rans that populate the stock market.Here are a few of the list's current offerings, and when they first appeared on the list.Ambarella (AMBA) showed up on the IBD 50 list in February last year, as it carved through its first real base. The cup showed a 33% decline, the deepest allowed for a good cup base. The designer of chips that go into wearable cameras broke out at 13.52 in massive volume in March and ran up 170% to a Jan. 7, 2014, high of 36.49.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) was an IBD 50 play the week that it cleared a cup-with-handle base on May 22, 2013. A nine-month advance, up to just before its current modest consolidation, carried it 193% above that buy point.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) joined the IBD 50 crew as it was basing in early August 2012. It broke out from that base two weeks later, launching a run that would drive shares up 199% over the next 15 months.Generac Holdings (GNRC) was in the IBD 50 in July 2012 while forming the first tenable base amid a volatile advance. The portable and backup power generator manufacturer snapped out of the nine-week base in October, receiving an added boost from the heavens as Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast — knocking out power and driving up demand for generators.The stock tore out of a cup-with-handle base with a 24.44 buy point Oct. 1. By Nov. 5 it had climbed 60%. More recently, Generac notched a new high Monday, 144% above the initial entry.

A short involves borrowing shares to sell, essentially betting the stock will go down.

374,FLT,"Sector Leaders were mostly higher Thursday, as the general market roared back from losses earlier in the week and IBD's market outlook went from correction to uptrend under pressure.

"
377,FLT,"From the United Kingdom to Russia and down to Mexico and Brazil, Norcross, Ga.-based FleetCor Technologies  (FLT) is on the move.
"
378,FLT,"One of the top fuel-card companies in the U.S. for commercial vehicle fleets, it's been buying up local fuel-card networks outside the country to fuel its own growth.
"
379,FLT,"Buyout targets tend to have ""less sophisticated, underinvested and underutilized"" networks, said Wayne Johnson, an analyst with Raymond James.
"
380,FLT,"Most of the company's revenue comes from its payment network and card processing services for commercial and government fleets, tied to drivers' fuel purchases. Vehicles it serves tend to travel ""short hauls"" within 100 miles of loading spots, Johnson says.
"
381,FLT,"FleetCor charges a monthly fee to fleets using the fuel cards and a usage fee to gas stations that accept the cards. FleetCor's electronic network connects the two sides.
"
382,FLT,"After an acquisition, FleetCor turns up the throttle by transferring the new accounts to its platform ""and in doing so it can introduce new services and sometimes raise pricing,"" Johnson says.
"
383,FLT,"Strategic Acquirer
"
384,FLT,"Six to 12 months down the road, the acquisitions typically drive per-share earnings higher than analysts' expectations, he says.
"
385,FLT,"Case in point: FleetCor's third-quarter results, released Oct. 30 after the market close. Earnings jumped 30% from a year earlier to $1.08, 10 cents above Wall Street's consensus. Even excluding a tax benefit of 5 cents, it still beat views by 7 cents.
"
386,FLT,"Revenue grew 20% to $225.2 million, also above views.
"
387,FLT,"""It was an exceptional quarter,"" said Evercore Partners analyst David Togut. Investors must have thought so. Shares jumped nearly 8% the next day to a new high.
"
388,FLT,"It didn't hurt that the company announced it made two new acquisitions in October, expanding products and services. Togut says the buys will ""set the stage for strong earnings growth in 2014.""
"
389,FLT,"At the same time, management raised guidance for 2013 to $4.02 per share at the midpoint. The team started the year forecasting $3.65 at the midpoint and kept raising guidance.
"
390,FLT,"One of the new buys, Atlanta-based NexTraq, provides fleet operators with real-time telematics vehicle tracking and fuel monitoring services. The other, Epyx in the U.K., uses an Internet-based system to link leasing and commercial fleet clients to 9,000 service garages there, earning a fee each time the system is used to support a service transaction.
"
391,FLT,"""We've been looking for ideas to extend beyond fleet fueling into fleet maintenance,"" FleetCor CEO Ronald Clarke said in the earnings conference call.
"
392,FLT,"FleetCor also said it closed on one of two Brazilian acquisition deals previously announced, that of DB Trans, a payment company for truckers. The other, for card and voucher firm VB Servicos, closed in August.
"
393,FLT,"Togut figures the latest Brazilian acquisitions will add 20 cents to FleetCor's earnings in 2014.
"
394,FLT,"""FleetCor will almost certainly be the fastest earnings grower in my payments' coverage over the next few years,"" Togut said. He covers 24 payments stocks, including Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), Vantiv (VNTV) and FleetCor's closest rival, Maine-based WEX (WEX), formerly called Wright Express.
"
395,FLT,"WEX, which offers fleet and corporate payment products, also beat earnings and revenue views in the third quarter.
"
396,FLT,"""WEX is more of a U.S. company,"" Togut said, though he added that it's been stepping up international expansion.
"
397,FLT,"FleetCor has acquired nearly 60 companies since 2002. Third-quarter results got a lift from several of them, including deals made earlier this year in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil.
"
398,FLT,"In addition, it saw continued growth from a North American workforce lodging firm acquired in 2009, Corporate Lodging Consultants. CLC gives truck drivers discounted room rates.
"
399,FLT,"International revenue jumped nearly 30% from last year, ""led by our U.K. business,"" Clarke said, for a total of $109.9 million. Revenue in North America grew 13.6% to $115.3 million.
"
400,FLT,"Driving Growth Abroad
"
401,FLT,"International is close to accounting for 50% of the firm's revenue, up from about 30% a few years ago.
"
402,FLT,"Most of the company's acquisitions in recent years have occurred overseas. One of the largest was the $312 million purchase in late 2011 of AllStar Business Solutions, the U.K.'s leading fuel-card provider.
"
403,FLT,"Earlier that year a Mexico City-based prepaid fuel and food voucher business marked the company's entry into Latin America.
"
404,FLT,"Hopping aboard FleetCor's bandwagon in 2012 were a Russian fuel-card company and a fuel payment processor in Brazil. The latter targets trucks, ships, mining equipment and railroads; and links fleet operators, banks and oil companies.
"
405,FLT,"""It's a fixed-cost business so the company with the greatest amount of volume wins,"" Johnson said. ""FleetCor gets high margins and earnings acceleration from the layering on of new acquisitions on its existing infrastructure.""
"
406,FLT,"In addition to its core business, FleetCor has forged several outsourcing deals with oil companies such as Chevron (CVX), BP (BP) and Arco for managing their corporate cards in the U.S.
"
407,FLT,"Similar deals with oil companies in Europe could provide new growth opportunities, analysts say. But that could take several years given Europe's complexities, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a recent research note.
"
408,FLT,"One of the first major oil-company outsourcing deals in Europe was EuroShell's 2011 contract with FleetCor to process fuel-card transactions in 35 countries, Morgan Stanley noted. But platform conversions have been slow due to ""extensive customization requirements.""
"
409,FLT,"About 70% of European fleet volume flows through cards issued by oil companies and the bulk of those are still managed in-house, Morgan Stanley said.
"
410,FLT,"Meanwhile, FleetCor's growing presence in emerging markets is seen as a positive since card markets there are at earlier stages of development than in the U.S. and therefore will grow at a faster rate.
"
411,FLT,"But FleetCor's business in the U.K. market is hardly a laggard. Togut notes that third-quarter revenue jumped 35% from a year ago.
"
412,FLT,"In a new partnership with Visa Europe, FleetCor will roll out highly secure EMV cards in 2014 in the U.K., seen as a revenue driver that year.
"
413,FLT,"Acquisition opportunities are still plentiful in the fragmented U.S. market.

442,FLT,"Puerto Rico-based Evertec (EVTC) is another of several payment-processing stocks that are market leaders today.The industry already boasts Visa (V) and FleetCor (FLT). The latter has been one of the year's top stocks, while Visa remains rock steady amid the market's sell-off. New issue Qiwi (QIWI) hit another new high Friday and has surged more than 30% since its initial public offering at 17 a share on May 3.Evertec went public a few weeks before Qiwi, on April 12 at 20 a share. After a wild IPO session, Evertec shares settled into a shallow nine-week correction.The stock broke out of that base June 17 and the stock remains near the 22.10 buy point.Evertec serves 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, making it the leader in its market. It manages more than 4,100 automated teller machines and more than 104,000 point-of-sale terminals.At a presentation to investors this month, Evertec said the company finds itself at the confluence of a couple of strong trends. One is the growth of electronic payments, including the rising presence of card-swiping terminals. The other is the growth of the middle class in Latin America.The company's earnings surged 75% in the first quarter, the first time Evertec reported quarterly results. Revenue rose a modest 6%, in line with the performance of recent years.Its 2012 operating profit gain of 206% was the highest of 28 companies in the industry group. Its Q1 EPS increase was second-best in the group, after Qiwi.In the prospectus filed with the SEC, Evertec cited its high debt and its concentration in Puerto Rico as risk factors. It also mentioned its reliance on Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean.Until 2010, Evertec was a unit of Popular. That year, private equity firm Apollo Global Management acquired a 51% stake in Evertec. Those companies still own the majority of Evertec shares, according to SEC filings.

443,FLT,"The general market finished mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 up and the Nasdaq slightly down after a valiant comeback attempt. Volume fell across the board. Sector Leaders were holding up well with a couple of exceptions. SouFun Holdings (SFUN), the Chinese real estate website, slid 2.92 to 50.59 in 75% faster trade, but it…
"
444,FLT,"Leading names in the financial sector are showing strength. That's good news because rising financial stocks are often a harbinger of a rising stock market. Five financial stocks make the Sector Leaders list. That's more than any other sector. Two are mortgage servicing companies, Ocwen Financial (OCN) and Walter Investment Management (WAC). The big banks are selling off mortgage servicing…

445,FLT,"In recent months, increasing distribution days in the major averages didn't have much effect on overall market health. Stock indexes managed to hold near highs and leading growth stocks held up well. Today, distribution days remain contained but some leaders are starting to face increased selling pressure. LinkedIn (LNKD), for example, is back below its 10-week moving average as it…
"
446,FLT,"When the market is in a correction, pay attention to stocks that hold up better or buck the trend. These can go on to be big winners once the weight of the market is lifted.A number of leading stocks showed solid relative strength this past week.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) was quiet on headlines, but loud and clear in price and volume. The stock bolted 12% for the week, its biggest gain in more than three months.During the week, the stock blew past an 82.61 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Volume was 59% above average when the stock broke out Aug. 20. Its weekly turnover was also well above average — a sign of professional buying. Green Mountain is now 4% past the 82.61 entry.Big volume has been lacking in many leaders amid the summer doldrums, making it tricky to interpret.Facebook (FB) is making a run at its record high, hit on its May 2012 IPO. It cleared an alternative 39.42 buy point Friday in heavy trading. The stock has shown much improved action in recent months and has now closed above its IPO price of 38. It hasn't seen any signs of distribution in three months.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) ramped to a new high after clearing a 100.97 buy point from a three-weeks-tight pattern Aug. 22. It previously had trouble with resistance at the 100 level.The stock has been in a steep uptrend for more than a year.Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) continued to hold tight after big bouts of accumulation in July. It's now in a four-weeks-tight pattern with a 90.10 buy point. Tight action is a sign of institutional support.All of the stocks mentioned above are in buying range and make for fodder for your watch list. With the market in a correction, investors should avoid new buys. But it's good to have a buy list ready, if the market stages a follow-through.On a positive note, the current correction has been a mild one, even though the Nasdaq has sustained eight distribution days.The IBD 50 climbed 2.2% in the past week, outpacing the 1.5% rise in the Nasdaq as well as the S&P 500's 0.5% gain. The index of leading stocks has now climbed in eight of the past nine weeks.But there were a few big losers on the week. Chip designer  Ambarella (AMBA) fell to a three-month low before paring gains.Drugmaker Santarus (SNTS) gave up most of its gain past a 24.10 entry, but got support at its 50-day line.
"
447,FLT,"Another day of gains and closes near session highs for major averages Friday saw more solid performances by several Sector Leaders.One day after FleetCor Technologies (FLT) cleared a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern,  Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR) joined the party with a three-weeks-tight breakout of its own. The stock held gains nicely throughout Friday's session. Shares ended at 71.84, up 3.41. Volume was slightly above average.The risk with Questor is that the company derives nearly all its revenue from one drug: Acthar. But the drug has been a blockbuster so far. It's approved for 19 indications by the Food and Drug Administration, including multiple sclerosis relapses, infantile spasms and rheumatic disorders. It's also being looked at as a treatment for ALS, often referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease, a degenerative disease that affects motor neurons.When Questor reported second-quarter results in July, the company said it shipped 7,050 vials of Acthar, up 50% from a year ago. Paid prescriptions rose 35%.Elsewhere, LinkedIn (LNKD) outperformed again, rising 6.12 to 240.37 in light trade. Despite a distribution week during the week ended Aug. 16, LinkedIn has held gains nicely after soaring 13% during the week ended Aug. 2. The company recently announced it's moving into the teen market by setting up university pages where prospective college students can gather information. As of Sept. 12, the age minimum for LinkedIn membership will be lowered to 14 from 18.On the downside, Evercore Partners (EVR) underperformed, falling 77 cents to 46.68 in soft volume. The investment banking advisory firm recently broke out over 44.63. Its weekly chart is still sound as the stock trades tightly above its 10-week moving average.
"
448,FLT,"Stock indexes rebounded Thursday, but the day's headline was provided by a three-hour shutdown in the Nasdaq due to technical issues. The Nasdaq popped 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.9% and 0.4% respectively. The IBD 50 rose 1.1%. Volume fell on both major exchanges. Even before the Nasdaq's shutdown, top-rated stocks weren't attracting…

449,FLT,"Shares of FleetCor Technologies (FLT) hit a new high Thursday, one day after the stock cleared a follow-on chart pattern. The stock had formed a four-weeks-tight pattern. It moved above the 85.66 buy point Wednesday in heavy trading. Shares closed Thursday within the normal 5% buy range, which goes to 89.94. The payment-card company's stock has more than doubled since…
"
450,FLT,"Stocks ended with solid gains Friday after battling back from weakness spurred by a disappointing jobs report. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended up 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Both were down 1.6% at Friday's low. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.2%. According to preliminary data, volume ended higher across the board in the stock market today.Among leading stocks, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) reversed higher to a 6% gain. The stock had already risen 3% Thursday, following the pricing of a share offering. Dave & Buster's was recently featured in Stock Spotlight.Verisk Analytics (VRSK) stretched its win streak to four straight sessions. It rebounded from a 2% loss and rose 2%. The stock nearly reached a 79.98 buy point in a flat base. Verisk, which provides data to insurance underwriters and banks, will be added to the S&P 500 after Wednesday's close.Tyler Technologies (TYL) added 2% for its second straight new high. It's now 15% past a 145.84 buy point from a flat base cleared Sept. 14. On Thursday, the company announced that it would buy privately held New World Systems for $670 million in cash and stock.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) climbed 0.5% after bucking morning weakness. It failed to retake its 200-day moving average. Domino's will report Q3 earnings Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see the pizza chain's profit rising 17% to 74 cents a share..

CEO Truman Hunt says it will be the Nu Skin's ""largest product launch ever."" Shares slid 1% Friday.
"
458,FLT,"Like its fellow IBD 50 top 5 listers, Jazz Pharmaceuticals is firmly entrenched in its niche, specialty drugs. For example, more than 20% of the 50,000 diagnosed U.S. narcolepsy patients use its flagship Xyrem drug, which is projected to see annual sales of $600 million this year. Its leukemia drug Erwinaze and Prialt, for managing severe pain, are also seeing rising sales.

Its stock, which traded at 5.87 a share on July 9, 2010, closed up 1% at 70.18 on Friday, a 1,416% gain in a bit more than three years.

"
512,FLT,"Major averages scored nice gains Thursday despite a lengthy trading glitch on the Nasdaq that skewed volume. Several Sector Leaders followed the market higher.Priceline.com (PLCN) continues to act well after a recent breakout. Shares of the online travel firm rose 11.95 to 952.15. Priceline cleared a flat-base buy point of 847.43 in July. Soon after, it cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern.

It cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point of 100.97 Its fuel cards and workforce payment products help businesses get a better handle on spending.Elsewhere, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) gained 1.45 to 106.77.

Shares picked up 1.43 to 134.70. It's pulled back to within buying range in recent days, but with the market still in a correction, new buys should generally be avoided.Actavis, formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, is in the process of acquiring Warner Chilcott (WCRX).

"
514,FLT,"Even though the market's in a correction, some Sector Leaders continue to tempt investors, trading tightly after recent breakouts or sitting close to recent buy points.

FleetCor Technologies (FLT) rose 15 cents…
"
515,FLT,"A nice showing for the Nasdaq composite Tuesday resulted in solid performances by several Sector Leaders. Many continue to trade tightly after recent breakouts.

Full-year earnings are seen rising 33% this year and 28% in 2014.Yandex hit an intraday high of 34.79, up 21% from a prior buy point of 28.74. A key IBD sell rule is to take a 20% gain in a stock whenever you have it. One exception is when a stock rallies 20% in less than three weeks after a breakout. In this case, the stock should be held for eight weeks.The chart of FleetCor Technologies (FLT), meanwhile, continues to show tight trading after a recent breakout from a flat base. Shares rose 1.98 to 99.43 in brisk trade.Web.com Group (WWWW) outperformed, rising 0.64 to 28.58 in heavy volume. It recently found support at its 10-week moving average for the second time after a big breakout in early May.

709,FLT,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume rising considerably from Wednesday's levels.Tesla Motors (TSLA), GoPro (GPRO) and FleetCor Technologies (FLT) headlined the after-hours session after all three reported earnings.Tesla fell 2.5% during regular trading and lost 3% in after-hours despite reporting earnings and sales that handily beat expectations.Wearable camera maker GoPro crashed 8% in extended trading even though profit of 8 cents a share was better than expected. Sales rose 38% from a year ago to $245 million, also above forecasts.FleetCor was inactive after the provider of fuel cards and workforce payment products slightly beat on the bottom line with profit of $1.27 a share, up 28% from a year ago. Sales were mostly in-line with expectations at $273.5 million.In the stock market today, all 30 Dow components closed lower.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Nike (NKE) led the way, falling 4% and 3%, respectively. Nike followed Adidas lower after the German company issued a profit warning. Earnings from Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, disappointed.On Friday, watch for earnings from Chevron (CVX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Burger King (BKW), Catamaran (CTRX) and Gentherm (THRM).Friday's jobs report will also get a lot of attention.

726,FLT,"As shipments rise, Cass said, trucking supply is tightening, which is likely to lead to trucking companies charging higher rates, which the trucking industry would welcome.

795,FLT,"Every great trade begins with a great idea. While there's a wealth of places in IBD to get great ideas for your watch list, one feature that investors must check out is Sector Leaders.Published today on Page B1, the Sector Leaders are the top-rated stocks that meet IBD's most stringent fundamental and technical criteria. These stocks are also the cream of the crop in their respective sectors.Over the past year through March 6, Sector Leaders shot up 94.2% on a price-weighted basis, far outpacing a 21.6% gain for the S&P 500. Year-to-date through Monday's close, Sector Leaders are already up 16.2% vs. a 3.8% advance for the Nasdaq and 1.6% for the S&P 500.With the major redesign of the stock tables back in 2008, IBD made it much faster and easier to find the best stocks from each sector. Sector Leaders are boxed at the very top of each sector heading for easy reference. In Feb. 27's IBD, BitAuto (BITA), Facebook (FB) and Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) were the three Sector Leaders in the Internet sector, which was ranked No. 2.Note that not all of the 33 sectors in IBD will have Sector Leaders. To make it even easier, investors don't have to flip through all of the stock tables to look for the Sector Leaders. Charts of all of the Sector Leaders usually appear on Page B1 Tuesday through Friday. The Sector Leaders charts are elsewhere in Monday's edition.Stocks that make the Sector Leaders list can make for excellent watch-list candidates. Even if they already have broken out, investors should still pay attention and see if they're still in buying range or have crafted a secondary entry point.While the Sector Leaders can make for trade candidates, they can also help you gauge the overall condition of leading stocks. If Sector Leaders are breaking down even as the market is in confirmed uptrend, then that's not a good sign for investors.On the flip side, if Sector Leaders start rising in a down market, that gives you a clue to possible improving conditions ahead.Drugmaker Actavis (ACT) was featured in the July 26 Sector Leaders charts as it formed an eight-week flat base with a 133.10 buy point 1. The stock broke out that same day and has rallied 73% 2 to as high as 230.77.Other recent winners that appeared in Sector Leaders on July 26 were Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Michael Kors (KORS), Priceline.com (PCLN) and FleetCor Technologies (FLT).

"
868,FLT,"FleetCor Technologies (FLT) emerged as one of this year's biggest winners. This is the story of how that occurred.The issuer of fuel cards to trucking companies and other commercial-vehicle fleets has more than doubled in 2013, far outpacing the S&P 500's rise for the year.As with other market winners, FleetCor's success began with great fundamentals. Profit growth has been robust and steady, ranging from 30% to 50% over the past seven quarters.Revenue growth has been similarly impressive.Pretax profit margin topped 50% the past two years.FleetCor issues fuel cards that allow commercial fleet companies to track spending and cut costs while also reducing fraudulent fuel charges. Its growth has been fueled by acquisitions and expansion into Brazil and other countries.Also, like fellow credit card stocks MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V), FleetCor is benefiting from a global shift away from cash to credit and debit cards. All three stocks are leaders in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group, which has been highly ranked for much of the year.FleetCor's outstanding 2013 run actually began in 2012. The stock cleared the 41.40 buy point in a cup-without-handle base Aug. 15 in heavy volume.The stock started this year seeming to be overheating when it surged 10% the week of Feb. 8.Yet, FleetCor continued its advance. The stock formed a three-weeks-tight pattern, which it cleared on March 22 in huge volume (1). Its Earnings Per Share Rating was a best-possible 99 at the time, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was A-.On July 28, FleetCor cleared an 89.85 buy point in a flat base (2). Then, about a month later, it climbed above a 100.97 three-weeks-tight entry (3).In early October it briefly erased its gain from the 100.97 entry, piercing its 50-day line in heavy volume. Investors who had big profits on the stock could have taken that as a cue to sell. But the stock soon recovered and was again hitting new highs.That hiccup was about the only difficult period for FleetCor in 2013, making it not just one of the year's winners but also one of the easiest leading stocks to own.Currently, FleetCor is forming an irregular ascending base. The ascending base would be, however, a riskier third-stage base.

"
989,FLT,"One company that aims to help them do that is FleetCor Technologies (FLT). It provides payment products and services to commercial fleets, major oil firms and petroleum marketers, serving more than 530,000 commercial accounts in 18 countries.

"
997,FLT,"The company's annual revenue has more than doubled over the past five years thanks to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. About two-thirds of FleetCor's business comes from North America, with the rest coming from international markets across the globe.

"
1032,FLT,"One could argue that the L in CAN SLIM is the lynchpin of IBD's investing system. It stands for leaders — the best stocks culled from thousands on offer.Finding just a handful of true leaders in the early stages of their big run-ups can bring great wealth to the disciplined investor. Baidu (BIDU), Apple (AAPL) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are just a few recent examples of top stocks that racked up huge returns.""The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir,"" wrote IBD founder William O'Neil in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""Leading stocks have the best fundamentals and sound chart patterns. The shares are in demand by mutual funds and other big investors. Why? Top companies offer unique products and services that take market share away from their competitors.""By number one, I don't mean the largest company or the one with the most recognized brand name,"" O'Neil wrote. ""I mean the one with the best quarterly and annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit margins, the strongest sales growth, and the most dynamic stock-price action.""The Big Picture column and the Market Pulse box that appear in IBD each day focus on the action of leading stocks.Use the Timesaver Tables, the Stock Spotlight and IBD's Smart Tables, which focus on stocks with superior fundamentals.Each stock is accompanied by key metrics, such as the Relative Price Strength Rating. The RS rating is the quickest way to create a list of promising candidates. A rating of 99 indicates the stock is outperforming 99% of all listed companies over the past 52 weeks. An RS Rating of 50 shows that it's outperforming only half of all stocks. Eliminate those with an RS Rating of 85 or lower.The Composite Rating, Accumulation-Distribution Rating and the Earnings Per Share Rating can also be used to screen for the best stocks. It's not unusual to see leading stocks post triple-digit quarterly earnings and sales growth before starting their big runs. Many also show strong prior uptrends that have outperformed most other stocks.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) had strong fundamentals when it broke out above a 41.40 cup-base buy point on Aug. 15, 2012. Profit during the quarter of its breakout jumped 48%, topping the healthy 28% increases in each of the prior two quarters. Sales growth was similarly strong.At the time, the stock scored a 98 Composite Rating, a 97 EPS and a 91 RS. The day after the breakout, FleetCor appeared in the Market Pulse box, Stock Spotlight and in the Time Saver tables, highlighting it as a leader.FleetCor has moved up steadily along its 10-week line.

1145,FLT,"Most sector leaders rose Tuesday along with the market, but only three attracted heavy volume. Russia's largest Internet search engine company was the busiest leader. Yandex (YNDX) skidded 1.56 to 21.44, cutting under its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Volume was 783% above average. The loss in big volume was a nasty introduction to leadership. Yandex joined the sector-leader list…

1146,FLT,"New highs again outnumbered new lows Friday, even though the market showed lackluster action. Most new highs came from the finance and insurance space. Trimble Navigation (TRMB) headed north for the third straight session Friday, logging its seventh straight weekly gain. Despite a lack of company news, volume surged from the past two sessions, marking its busiest session in more…

1147,FLT,"Keeping with the indexes' small moves in below-average volume Monday, most sector leaders were quiet. The exception was FleetCor Technologies (FLT), which slid 1.04 to 51.70 in volume that was 136% above average. On Friday, the fuel card provider finished a three-weeks-tight pattern, presenting a potential entry at 53. FleetCor could still clear that buy point, but Monday's action was…

1148,FLT,"Even though the major market indexes rallied in impressive fashion, most Sector Leaders gave a lackluster showing Tuesday. Some turned tail or failed to keep pace with the market. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) fell 0.87 to 59.13 in more than three times average trade, ending a five-session win streak. Early Tuesday, the drugmaker priced a secondary offering of 5.375 million shares…

1151,FLT,"There was not a quiet moment Wednesday for Sector Leaders, with some dramatic moves appearing amid the broad market's upside reversal. 3D Systems (DDD) shot up 3.12, or 7%, scoring a new 52-week high. Volume nearly doubled from its average pace, its third-straight overactive session. What had begun as a mild, low-volume climb from the 10-week moving average turned into…

1162,FLT,"The several Sector Leaders were moderately mixed Friday, although the calm chart activity of one of the stocks was still significant.CommVault (CVLT) rose 1 to 77.47 in about half its usual volume. What was meaningful about that otherwise pedestrian move was the fact that the stock has now been consolidating for five weeks.That shallow correction can now be considered a flat base in the making. The potential buy point is 79.63.The data-management software company had already found support at its 50-day moving average a couple of times since it broke out of an ascending base on Dec. 18 past a 70.02 buy point.CommVault, the leader in the data management industry group, is discussed in an article today on Page B2.In another noteworthy move, Lithia Motors (LAD) made a new high after climbing 87 cents to 45.02. Volume was well below average.The operator of car dealerships found support after pulling back to its 50-day moving average in late February and the beginning of March.Volume was mostly quiet as shares rebounded but that didn't stop Lithia from reaching the new high.Lithia's record high was barely above the 45 price level where shares hit resistance last month. Thus, this area remains an obstacle for the stock.The stock had joined the Sector Leaders screen early last week, but it did not make that select list for the retail sector in today's edition.Several other leaders were practically flat for the week. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Ocwen Financial (OCN) and FleetCor Technologies (FLT) rose less than 1%.

1163,FLT,"Most Sector Leaders ceded a bit of ground Wednesday in soft volume. But one stock moved up to a new high with modestly above-average volume. FleetCor Technologies (FLT) stretched its winning streak to five days, rising 0.57 to 51.12 in above-average volume. This is FleetCor's sharpest upward trajectory in recent trade after months of riding its upward 10-week line in…

1164,FLT,"The Sector Leaders put in a mixed performance Tuesday, with most movements and volume muted by the impending Thanksgiving holiday. FleetCor Technologies (FLT) put in one of the two best performances among the bunch. Shares of the specialized payment services provider climbed 1.08 to 50.55 — a new high — as volume rose 55% above its usual pace. FleetCor broke…

It's executing its first rebound off its 10-week moving average since an August breakout. The stock now…
"
1172,FLT,"For yet another week, the current stock market uptrend stayed intact and produced more bullish moves by highly rated stocks.A few IBD 50 names took it on the chin, however. It's important in IBD-style investing to watch for possible breakdowns among leading stocks, since that can serve as a caution flag. So far, though, struggles among the leaders haven't been that widespread.3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS) were among the week's big losers.3D Systems slumped to its 10-week moving average in big volume. It had dropped that key support level in the week ended Feb. 1, then tried to rally. Meanwhile, rival 3D printer maker Stratasys undercut its 10-week line.Generac Holdings (GNRC) also lost considerable ground, though it erased some losses after touching its 10-week line. The power generator maker reported Q4 results that crushed forecasts, but its outlook disappointed the market.Among the week's big winners, Michael Kors (KORS) made a gap-up move on its strong earnings report. The fashion house jumped back above its recent 58.72 buy point after running into resistance at that level in late January.Other IBD 50 stocks have continued to climb to fresh highs, becoming even more extended from their last buying ranges. ARM Holdings (ARMH), FleetCor Technologies (FLT), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Waddell & Reed Financial (WDR) match this description.You also can still find some stocks that aren't that far extended from their recent buy zones. Ocwen Financial (OCN) cleared a 39.35 trigger from a cup-with-handle base a couple of weeks ago, but it's still not that far past that level.Note that the mortgage servicer's latest base was a third-stage pattern — riskier and not as fresh as a first- or second-stage structure.In addition, there are IBD 50 names that have offered secondary buying opportunities via 10-week rebounds.Consider fracking play U.S. Silica (SLCA) and South Korean chipmaker MagnaChip Semiconductor (MX). Keep in mind that MagnaChip's action also could be viewed as a base-building effort.For the week, the IBD 50 index fell 0.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq and NYSE composite both edged down less than 0.1% for the week. The Nasdaq bid farewell to a six-week winning streak.The S&P 500 edged up a little more than 0.1%, extending its winning streak to seven weeks.

1207,FLT,"With the market uptrend now more than a month in length, the major indexes are at their best levels in months or, in the S&P 500's case, in four years.But the choppy action has made the environment tough. One thing investors can do to find leaders in a tough market is to look for those with strong relative strength lines. A few issues in this week's Your Weekly Review have RS lines at or near new highs and are still in buying range.Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) is about 2% past a 44.70 buy point from a three-weeks-tight pattern. Although the stock is near an all-time high, it hasn't done much since clearing the secondary buy setup Aug. 20.The stock has been in a solid uptrend since clearing a cup-with-handle base in December. Its 10-week moving average has contained the majority of the move.Last month, the regional bank beat expectations with a 73% surge in Q2 earnings. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 50% for the year.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) cleared a 41.40 trigger in a cup base Aug. 15 in more than twice its average trade. It's now about 4% past that trigger and within buying range up to 43.47.The fuel card provider's stock has nearly doubled after going public in December 2010, but it hasn't been a smooth ride. Last year, the stock went through a 36% correction. The correction in its latest base was half of that.Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage (NGVC) is just about 5% past a 20.58 buy point from an IPO base cleared Aug. 27. Its buying range extends to 21.61.The Lakewood, Colo.-based firm runs supermarkets that sell natural and organic foods and diet supplements in about 12 states.Natural Grocers had delivered triple-digit profit growth for three straight quarters. Analysts are expecting another this quarter.
"
1208,FLT,"The broad market's romp to new highs has obscured stumbles by some leading stocks.The major indexes' four-day winning streak, which struck new multiyear highs, sparked some standout volume. But volume also appeared on the downside the past few weeks, and the distribution day is getting awfully high.Meanwhile, a good number of IBD 50 stocks are falling hard.Prototype systems maker Proto Labs (PRLB) on Wednesday broke out past its 49.78 buy point from a consolidation. But the stock reversed lower the next day, surrendering all of a fat 6% gain. The stock fell further Friday, and closed below its trigger.Ocwen Financial (OCN), which services mortgage loans, sliced below its 50-day line with huge volume March 19 and has made just one attempt to regain it — unsuccessfully.U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA) logged plenty of volume since peaking March 11. The stock reversed lower that day and went on to correct as much as 18% through April 5. The decline, sparked by news of a secondary offering, was halted at the stock's 10-week line.But this is the stock's third such test and, what's worse, has so far been unable to muster much of a bounce.Some top-rated stocks seem to be rising reluctantly.Flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators (LL) made its second test of its 10-week line two weeks ago. The stock has bounced some, but volume has been dismal.FleetCor Technologies (FLT), a provider of payment systems to commercial auto fleets and the oil industry, lurched to new highs last week.But the biggest volume surges seen in the past three weeks have been on the downside. FleetCor Technologies has tested its 10-week line three times since its mid-August breakout.Alaska Air Group (ALK) has yet to recover from its three-day sell-off April 1-3, which had cost the stock 10%. Volume soared in two of those sessions and has since calmed.Since breaking out of a cup-shaped base in late October, Alaska Air has provided entries through two three-weeks-tight patterns and two tests of its 10-week line. A third test would carry added risk, especially if the stock rushes the line with heavy volume.Biomed issue Medicines Co. (MDCO) reversed lower March 26, and has since drifted down to rest on its 50-day line.The bounce so far has been meager, as has the volume.

That would be down from three prior quarters of double-digit growth.

Acadia cleared a 41.40 buy point from a six-week flat base.

There were just 12 IPOs in 2009 and six the year before, the two worst years since the mid-1970s.The slow IPO market hurt the ability of VC firms to make money and to raise new funds. The fourth-quarter IPO boomlet provides hope.""We're not where we'd like to be just yet, but things are certainly moving in the right direction,"" said NVCA President Mark Heesen. ""I'm particularly optimistic about the 44 companies in registration.""These are companies that have filed to go public, but haven't done so yet.

1420,FLT,"The finance sector is producing top performers in diverse areas. And analysts say several still have legs.The broad sector has been catapulted by the Finance/Mortgage & Related Services industry group.That group has been ranked No. 1 among IBD's 197 industry groups for weeks.The finance sector is getting strength from other groups such as Finance-Investment Management. It's in the top 20, up from No. 74 seven months ago. Another is Finance-Investment Banks/Bankers, near 50, up from 141.A third is Finance-Credit Cards/Payment Processing, which is hovering near 50.A lot of the sector's thrust comes from mutual funds. In its latest disclosure, $84.7 billion Fidelity Contrafund added to its stake in Visa (V). The $596 million Wells Fargo Advantage Enterprise opened a position in Affiliated Managers Group (AMG). The $244 million American Century Small Company started a stake in NetSpend Holdings (NTSP).Visa is surfing the transition to electronic payment from cash and checks. It has also benefited from waning investor fears over impact of the Durbin Amendment. That law limits debit-card swipe fees.Visa's share of the debit-card market fell. ""The law didn't impact Visa as much as investors feared,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Greg Smith.Visa also has an initial settlement of a large merchants' lawsuit over alleged antitrust actions related to credit card transaction fees.Half the world pays for goods and service in cash, Smith noted. ""So the emergence of middle classes in those countries will likely benefit Visa and MasterCard (MA),"" he added.Debt-Card DynamoNetSpend, which provides reloadable prepaid debit cards, went public at 11 in 2010, peaked above 16 and troughed below 4 in 2011.Regulatory issues prevented it from adding new customers, Smith says. The company has solved much of that, diversified its bank partners and is adding customers.It has expanded sales by selling cards through retailers, with recent deals with 7-11, Safeway (SWY) and some dollar stores.""We expect acceleration in revenues and earnings growth next year,"" Smith said.Affiliated Managers has been driven by a shift in its business model, says Morningstar Inc. analyst Greggory Warren. The firm used to rely solely on taking equity stakes in one boutique money manager after another. Now Affiliated has developed a global distribution network. Its affiliates grow revenue and earnings by expanding their sales.""As long as they have performance and products investors want — which is emerging markets funds and alternative investment vehicles — there's no reason to think they can't keep this up,"" Warren said.Affiliated's assets under management have grown about 8% this year, he said, vs. contraction for the industry.Daniel Kraninger, a manager of $56 million CAN SLIM Select Growth , likes FleetCor Technologies ' (FLT) earnings growth.

1547,FLT,"Losses were oddly distributed among leaders Friday as the market coped with bad news from the fiscal-cliff war. Some leaders got smacked, some held up with modest losses — and a few actually moved up.Fashion designer and retailer Michael Kors (KORS) fell 3% in modestly above-average volume. But the stock had sunk as much as 6% before clawing back enough to regain its 10-week line.U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA), a provider of silica to various industries — including fracking companies — dived 3%. Here, too, volume was muted. And the stock pared what was a 7% loss.But Bonanza Creek Energy (BCEI) shot up 4% to a new high. Volume surged to four times its norm. The oil and gas producer broke out Tuesday from a cup base. The 26.70 buy point sparked a volume surge that has yet to cool off. Bonanza ended the session 8% above that trigger.FleetCor Technologies (FLT), a provider of payment solutions to commercial fleets and oil companies, poked 1% higher in low volume. FleetCor has been riding higher for months along its uptrending 10-week moving average.Drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) climbed 1% in fast trade. The stock scored a small upside reversal after dropping 1% at the open. Watson is pushing past resistance at 90, which looks like a breakout from a shallow base.Home-beverage-systems maker SodaStream (SODA) fell 3% in average turnover, but the stock recovered from an earlier 6% loss. SodaStream couldn't quite regain its 43.10 cup-with-handle buy point.3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), two makers of 3D printers and prototype systems, each bucked the selling to log small gains in below-average trade.3D Systems ended 16% past its 44.90 buy point from a cup-shaped base. That breakout was treacherous. The stock fell 8% from its Nov. 1 breakout, then regained the trigger price, then fell 8% again — and then took off.Stratasys also has put in a choppy climb. The stock ended 15% above its 69.18 cup-with-handle entry.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), a Chinese Web-based security software distributor and, more recently, the search engine that's challenging Baidu's (BIDU) dominance, pared its 3% loss to just 1%, and finished 9% above its 24.40 trigger from a cup-with-handle base.Cloud issue SolarWinds (SWI) fell 3% in fast trade.

Bank of America (BAC) rose more than 2% and closed back near a 24.88 buy point. JPMorgan (JPM) rose 2% and hit a new high.

1566,FLT,"The IBD 50 put in a robust performance in May, thanks in part to outstanding gains in several components that held up after the market started to soften.The IBD 50 jumped 7.6% in May, the best month for the index since its 7.7% advance in February 2012.It easily beat the S&P 500, which rose 2.1% last month, and the Nasdaq's 3.8% climb.The IBD 50 made its best progress in the first part of the month. It rallied more than 10% until May 21, about twice what the S&P 500 had risen up to that point.After the market's May 22 peak, the IBD 50 shaved 2.3%. A lot of the month's winners held up during that time, helping the index sustain much of its overall gain.Chalk up that success to the month's winners.Those included Biogen Idec (BIIB), which has not broken stride since it cleared a base in January. It added 8.5% for the month, ending May near all-time highs.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) made all of its 27% monthly gain in one day: May 9. The previous evening, the Keurig brewer maker posted strong quarterly results and announced a broadened partnership with Starbucks (SBUX).Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) is up 13% from its 60.30 buy point. It broke out just as the market was topping, which contributed to the IBD 50's relative strength in the final weeks of the month.Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) has slowed after catapulting from a base on May 8. The stock rocketed after reporting earnings.MercadoLibre (MELI) soared 18% May 7, following the company's first-quarter results.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) vaulted 23% May 24 and May 28 on news, later confirmed, that Valeant would acquire contact-lens maker Bausch & Lomb.The two-day rally was another reason the IBD 50 held up better after the market peaked.Last week, the IBD 50 inched up less than 0.1%. Even that meager gain beat the broad market because the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each fell modestly.A few more stocks broke out during the holiday-shortened week.For example, PolyOne (POL) topped a cup-without-handle base Tuesday, although volume was merely average.

1620,FLT,"Wells Fargo Advantage Small Company Growth Fund aims for big results from small cap stocks.

1622,FLT,"The strategy has worked well enough for the $204 million fund over the past 12 months going into Thursday to gain 3.60% vs. 2.56% for its small-cap rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 3.44% for the S&P 500.
"
1623,FLT,"Bill Grierson, 41, is one of the fund's five managers, all from Peregrine Capital Management, which the fund hired as subadviser. He discussed his team's approach from his office in Minneapolis.
"
1624,FLT,"IBD: You look for information gaps that occur at either of two points in a stock's life cycle. Explain those please, Bill.
"
1625,FLT,"Grierson: One happens in the earliest stages of a company's cycle. We look for signs of high growth. We look for long-term earnings per share growth greater than 20% a year. And we try to find that at a time when the company is still largely unknown. This buy point is right before the company's discovery phase by Wall Street.
"
1626,FLT,"The second time this can happen is right before what we call the rediscovery phase. This is when a stock is about to re-emerge after going through some difficulty. You can see earnings acceleration. Maybe the company has changed management. It may be due to a new product or a product upcycle. Or maybe the company has undervalued assets. These companies should provide at least 40% EPS growth within 12 months.
"
1627,FLT,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
1628,FLT,"Grierson: Zoll Medical (ZOLL) is a rediscovery name. We bought it in 2009. Their core business is a cardiac defibrillator used in EMT ambulances and hospitals. It's a fine business but relatively mature, not high growth.
"
1629,FLT,"In 2009 it was cyclically down. It was hit by low hospital spending rates. Hospital financing was difficult, limiting capital expenditures.
"
1630,FLT,"We watched the company for years. We were interested in an emerging product area. We bought it when this new product, their external LifeVest, reached a level of scale, growth and visibility that would serve as a catalyst for closure of a large information gap.
"
1631,FLT,"The vest is an external, wearable, portable defibrillator. It's targeted to patients who have had a recent cardiac event or heart attack and are at risk for another heart attack and could die. They are contraindicated for an implant (of a pacemaker) for three months following that event.
"
1632,FLT,"LifeVest helps avoid that. It's a huge unserved market. It is $1.8 billion in the U.S. alone. When we bought it, LifeVest had a $35 million annualized sales rate. In the latest quarter, LifeVest had a $140 million sales rate. So the real catalyst in Zoll is this new product area.
"
1633,FLT,"IBD: Many investors see U.S. large caps as a safe haven from a global GDP growth slowdown. Is it harder to find small caps that you like?
"
1634,FLT,"Grierson: In a word, no.
"
1635,FLT,"IBD: Why not?
"
1636,FLT,"Grierson: The contrast between large and small caps is not lost on us. But we still like small caps.
"
1637,FLT,"One dynamic that validates the space is the high rate of takeover activity. Over time we average five takeovers a year in our portfolio. In 2010 we had 11. In 2011 we had nine. So far this year we've had one already.
"
1638,FLT,"One reason for that is attractive valuations. In our long history, our average price-earnings ratio is about 16. Currently, it is 13 times the next 12 months' earnings.
"
1639,FLT,"IBD: You are a bottom-up investor, but sector weights show where you expect to find most leaders. Technology is by far your largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Dec. 31. Why is that sector so attractive?
"
1640,FLT,"Grierson: Our largest overweights are in sectors with the largest growth opportunities. And tech qualifies. We're about 400 basis points overweight vs. the Russell 2000 Growth Index.
"
1641,FLT,"IBD: What do you like about Aruba Networks (ARUN)? It has six quarters of sharply decelerating EPS growth. And it's 40-week and 10-week moving averages are inverted, and the stock is in between them.
"
1642,FLT,"Grierson: We bought it in December 2009 at a little under 9. It's trading in the low 20s now.
"
1643,FLT,"They're the leading provider of wireless LAN infrastructure products. We think that's a large emerging megatrend within the communications space. They're experiencing rapid growth. The sequential comparisons are tough because 2009 was brutal. The years since then have been recoveries. But now the easiest comps are behind them. It's normal to see deceleration in growth as the recovery matures. We still like their long-term picture.
"
1644,FLT,"IBD: InvenSense (INVN) is a newcomer to the portfolio as of your latest disclosure. It debuted at 7.50 on Nov. 16. Did you buy at the IPO?
"
1645,FLT,"Grierson: We did. We knew this company's management team, its CFO, for well over a decade and had invested with him before in other situations. That helped us develop incremental conviction in this company's growth story and execution potential.
"
1646,FLT,"The core story here is motion sensors for mobile devices. Their first large customer was Nintendo for the Wii system. They levered that into designs for other mobile devices, and have emerged as the leading motion sensor company for the Android and set food chain and Android tablet food chain. So this is a play on mobile and tablet growth.
"
1647,FLT,"They're gaining share with lower cost product, enabled by their proprietary packing and production and patented process.
"
1648,FLT,"They're currently shipping a three-axis gyroscope for about $1.50. They are moving to a six-axis gyro, for which they will garner incremental price. They are moving to a nine-axis gyro.
"
1649,FLT,"They are serving secular growth markets and gaining share, with rising average sales prices. This is a powerful growth story.
"
1650,FLT,"IBD: You like growthy tech stories, but you clearly don't fall in love with names. I see you've been paring Bottomline Technologies (EPAY) for four quarters. What changed?
"
1651,FLT,"Grierson: We bought at under 7. It's trading in the mid-20s. Our cuts are the result of profit-taking.
"
1652,FLT,"The company is a play on business-to-business invoices moving online. Today, 60% of B2B invoices are handled with a check. It's wildly costly and time inefficient. Driving this online lowers costs and speeds up the time cycle.
"
1653,FLT,"IBD: Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) is another name you cut, almost by half in your latest disclosure.
"
1654,FLT,"Grierson: Their information gap closure came rapidly for us. There was a lot of price appreciation.
"
1655,FLT,"They make flash controllers. This is another play on growth in mobile devices. Every mobile device, whether a tablet or handheld, has a Nand flash controller. (Nand is a form of flash memory that retains data without power.) To operate well, it needs a controller.
"
1656,FLT,"IBD: Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) has had triple-digit EPS growth three of the past four quarters. (Q4 EPS and sales growth both beat views.) What's your thesis?
"
1657,FLT,"Grierson: They're a leading electronic design automation company. Their software is used in the R&D and chip design phase of semiconductor companies. They have a dominant franchise.
"
1658,FLT,"They had been undermanaged. Their new management (as of 2009) should reinvigorate the product suite.
"
1659,FLT,"They've also changed how they recognize revenue. They went from an upfront basis to recognizing revenues over the life of contracts.
"
1660,FLT,"When they took an earnings hit (several quarters ago) the stock also took a hit. We used that as an opportunity to buy.
"
1661,FLT,"IBD: Health care is your second largest weighting. What do you like about Accretive Health (AH)?
"
1662,FLT,"Grierson: Their core offering is to hospitals. The idea is that for no upfront cost, Accretive comes in and takes over front-end operations — admissions, billings. They want to drive 400 to 800 basis points of cost improvements. In return, they take a portion of that improvement as pay.
"
1663,FLT,"It's a $50 billion market opportunity in the U.S. alone. Accretive believes it's only 5% penetrated.
"
1664,FLT,"They aim for trend-setters as customers. Names like Ascension, Henry Ford, Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Fairview. If they can improve costs at the best, subsequent sales should hopefully come easier.
"
1665,FLT,"IBD: You bought into GNC Holdings (GNC), then sold your stake, then bought back in. What's your aim?
"
1666,FLT,"Grierson: They are the supplements and nutrition company whose stores you see a lot.
"
1667,FLT,"They are levered to the lifestyle trend of healthy living. That tail wind is not fully reflected in the stock price.
"
1668,FLT,"They have 7,200 locations. They are growing that modestly with in-store locations in Rite Aid (RAD) stores and others.
"
1669,FLT,"They are also growing their private-label products. We believe those support 20% annual growth for the next three to five years.
"
1670,FLT,"IBD: What's your thesis for Fleetcor Technologies (FLT)?
"
1671,FLT,"Grierson: They provide prepaid debit cards for fleet operators.
"
1672,FLT,"Truck drivers use the cards to buy gas. Fleetcor's customers are large corporations and maybe some government entities.
"
1673,FLT,"It's a powerful cash flow model that is highly visible and profitable. And there are high barriers to entry.
"
1674,FLT,"IBD: MSC Industrial (MSM) supplies custodians. The stock's on a run. What do you like here?
"
1675,FLT,"Grierson: They're a large provider in a highly fragmented industry called maintenance, repairs and operations. They have a catalog of over 600,000 SKUs from over 3,000 suppliers.
"
1676,FLT,"What we like is that during the downturn, when others were cutting back spending, they added to their sales force.
"
1677,FLT,"The Street didn't like that. We bought when the fundamental inflection showed that MSC's expenditures would enable them to gain share as the recovery matured. That's just what we've seen happen.
"
1678,FLT,"IBD: Bill, do you and your colleagues divide responsibilities? Does each manager specialize in certain sectors, for example?
"
1679,FLT,"Grierson: We all work as generalists and consider each position a team decision as we all actively participate in the idea vetting process.Wells Fargo Advantage Small Company Growth Fund aims for big results from small cap stocks.It does that, like many investors, by looking for underappreciated names.

We believe those support 20% annual growth for the next three to five years.IBD: What's your thesis for Fleetcor Technologies (FLT)?Grierson: They provide prepaid debit cards for fleet operators.Truck drivers use the cards to buy gas. Fleetcor's customers are large corporations and maybe some government entities.It's a powerful cash flow model that is highly visible and profitable. And there are high barriers to entry.IBD: MSC Industrial (MSM) supplies custodians. The stock's on a run. What do you like here?Grierson: They're a large provider in a highly fragmented industry called maintenance, repairs and operations. They have a catalog of over 600,000 SKUs from over 3,000 suppliers.What we like is that during the downturn, when others were cutting back spending, they added to their sales force.The Street didn't like that. We bought when the fundamental inflection showed that MSC's expenditures would enable them to gain share as the recovery matured. That's just what we've seen happen.IBD: Bill, do you and your colleagues divide responsibilities? Does each manager specialize in certain sectors, for example?Grierson: We all work as generalists and consider each position a team decision as we all actively participate in the idea vetting process.

1680,FLT,"Shares of ICF International, Inc. (ICFI  -  Free Report) have gained 35.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the 5.3% rise of the industry it belongs to. Both government and commercial businesses remain in good shape, courtesy of improvement in business development pipeline and win rates.
"
1681,FLT,"Outsourcing is the business of transferring the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis. The buoyancy in the outsourcing space is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank in the top 37% (95 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stocks — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.57 billion, Paychex’s market cap is $24.56 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with a VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over Paychex in terms of investment attractiveness. Paychex has a VGM Score of D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over Paychex in terms of price performance. Shares of Broadridge have gained 53% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%. Paychex, despite rallying 20.9% in the same time frame, underperformed both Broadridge and the industry it belongs to. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Paychex’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 11.3% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  For 2019, Paychex’s earnings are expected to register 10.9% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge.Thus, Paychex has an edge over Broadridge in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge has performed better than Paychex, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 23.6%. Paychex delivered a positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 1.2%.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 27.6%, Paychex not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and Paychex is 28.5 and 27.9, respectively, while that of the industry is 27.5. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Paychex has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge scores over Paychex in terms of price performance and earnings surprise history. Paychex, however, has an edge in terms of expected earnings growth and net margin. Although both companies carry a Zacks Rank #2, Broadridge, with a better style score, has a higher probability of success in the near term. However, a faster share price rally in the past year has led to a relatively rich valuation for Broadridge compared to Paychex.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report). While Automatic Data Processing and Dun & Bradstreet sport a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR carries a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing, Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and FLEETCOR Technologies is 11.3%, 6% and 16.5%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Revenue (TTM) Fiserv, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteAcquisitions a Key CatalystFiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions.  The company completed four acquisitions — Online Banking Solutions, Inc., PCLender, LLC, Dovetail Group Limited and Monitise plc — in 2017.

1686,FLT,"First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report) stock has rallied 23.4% in the past six months against the industry’s loss of 0.1%. We believe prudent business moves in the form of strategic acquisitions, partnerships and agreements led to this impressive price performance. Diversified product portfolio is another major positive.Notably, First Data reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings of 29 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and increased 3.6% on a year-over-year basis. Total segment revenues came it at $2.1 billion, outpacing the consensus mark by $176 million. The figure was up 11% year over year on a reported basis, 10% on a comparable accounting basis and 5% on an organic constant-currency basis.What’s Driving First Data?First Data’s business segmentation allows it to strengthen its global client base and globalize its offerings. The company’s comprehensive offerings include retail point-of-sale, e-commerce services, credit solutions, next generation offerings such as mobile payment services and cloud-based point-of-sale operating system.Acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst for First Data. In January 2018, the company completed the purchase of GreekBill, a financial management service provider for almost $17 million. In 2017, First Data completed three acquisitions - Accullink Inc. (May 2017), CardConnect Corp. (July 2017) and BluePay Holdings, Inc. (December 2017). All the three companies, which offer technology enabled payment processing solutions, were integrated in the company’s Global Business Solutions segment. These acquisitions will boost the segment’s offerings and open up more growth opportunities for First Data.Strategic partnerships and agreements have also been playing a significant role in shaping the growth trajectory of the company. Since the beginning of this year, First Data entered into four partnerships with SBI Card (Jan 25), RBL Bank (Mar 11), Navient (May 23) and Mastercard (Jun 13). First Data is offering its innovative VisionPLUS software to SBI and RBL Bank to help them offer card processing services across India. The company is acting as the primary technology solutions provider for Navient's federal and private education loans. Alliance with Mastercard involves First Data offering its digital disbursement platform, Disburse-to-Debit solution to Mastercard’s business customers. These endeavors will expand First Data’s client base and are likely to boost top-line growth.First Data’s Enterprise Business is also doing well. The company differentiates itself in this space by consistently offering new features and solutions to existing clients while making continuous efforts to expand its client base. The company continues to expand its enterprise business through client wins. It has healthy business around large and small banks. A strong and comprehensive product suite increases receptivity and offers good opportunities to grow organically.

1687,FLT,"Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) stock has rallied 11% in the past three months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.5%.We believe robust organic growth and strategic acquisitions have backed this impressive price performance. Stericycle’s focus on providing business-to-business services in highly regulated areas to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies is appreciable.Notably, Stericycle reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents and increased 11% on year-over-year basis. Revenues of $895 beat the consensus mark by $10 million and increased 0.3% year over year.What’s Driving Stericycle?Acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst for Stericycle.

In 2017 and 2016,organic growth contributed $20.1 million and $94.6 million to total revenues, respectively. We believe the company’s efforts to improve offerings and platforms have helped it build a strong and loyal customer base. It has a revenue retention rate of nearly 90%. Stericycle is trying to grow by selling additional services to existing customers, while securing new ones. Strong client relationships imply that the company enjoys a dominant position in the market.Stericycle’s focus on providing business-to-business services in highly regulated areas to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies is appreciable. This makes it popular among smaller businesses where demand for regulatory assistance is high compared to larger businesses due to the lack of specialized staff. Such a business strategy generates higher profits as well as expands the company’s suite into additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services and secure information destruction.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Stericycle is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Notably, the company has witnessed a 14.1% rise in share price since it posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Let’s find out what’s supporting the rally.Transformation Initiatives ADP boasts a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. The company has a strong pipeline of new business bookings. It continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts. As a part of its transformation initiative, ADP has recently launched differentiated ""Next Gen"" platforms aimed at strengthening its position in HCM innovation, and improving its U.S. up-market and international product suite.ADP’s other notable and recent transformation-related achievements include accelerated DataCloud penetration, increased investment in inside sales, mid-market migrations, service alignment initiatives and voluntary early retirement program.On its Investor Day, ADP stated its plans to expand its ongoing transformation through several broad-based initiatives. These include Go-To-Market Initiatives like data-enabled market insights and streamlined support, Service Initiatives encompassing automated service enabler tools and optimized service locations, Product & Portfolio Initiatives including ongoing client upgrades and infrastructure optimization, and Operations & Support Initiatives such as procurement and pay-for-performance programs.Transformation initiatives are allowing the company to expand margins and improve innovation abilities.Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

QuoteDisciplined Approach Toward AcquisitionRecent acquisitions of WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company has strengthened ADP’s customer base and helped it expand operations in international markets. The company continues to pursue acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term.Increasing Scale and Reach of DistributionADP’s wide scale and reach of distribution provides it with a competitive advantage. The company’s HCM sales are improving every year with clients in 113 countries worldwide. Also, ADP is increasing its inside sales organization to capitalize on digital sales. It has a strong partner ecosystem with more than 20,000 partners referring each year.The ADP market place is one of the world’s largest of its kind, which digitally distributes more than 250 apps. Currently, the company is driving bookings growth through headcount, productivity and innovation.Strong Balance SheetADP’s strong balance sheet makes the stock attractive for investment in our view. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2018. ADP continues to use excess cash to aggressively buy back shares and pay out dividends. Continuing with its strategy of returning cash to shareholders, the company paid dividend of $995 million and repurchased stocks worth $1.26 billion during fiscal 2017.We believe that the strong balance sheet will not only help the company to continue shareholder friendly activities but also pursue strategic acquisitions and investments on product development in the long run. The dividend hike announced by the company in April 2018 highlights ADP's commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial position. It also indicates the company’s bright prospects.Increased and Extended Financial OutlookADP raised fiscal 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings and adjusted EBIT margin. Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated to be more or less flat compared to a decline of almost 50 bps (basis points) projected earlier. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to grow in the range of 16-17%, up from 12-13% guided earlier. However, the company reiterated the outlook for revenue growth in the band of 7-8%.Additionally, ADP announced extension of its fiscal 2021 outlook on its Investor Day.

1706,FLT,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after market close.We expect expanding data and machine learning-based analytics solutions, increased penetration in the identity and fraud prevention market and continuous expansion of its verification business to drive its top line in the to-be reported quarter. The bottom line is likely to decline due to buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the cybersecurity incident.We observe that shares of Equifax have rallied 11.2% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 4.7%. Top Line to Improve Year Over YearEquifax operates through four segments — U.S. Information Solutions (USIS), International, Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. While we expect strong performance of International and Workforce Solutions segments in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, the company’s business from USIS and Global Consumer Solutions are likely to decline.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) are expected to increase on the back of its expanding data and machine learning-based analytics solutions in Europe, Canada and Latin America, increased coverage in Australian and Latin American fraud prevention market and growing potential in debt management across the world. Revenues from product launches is another key growth catalyst. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $243 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues advanced 15% year over year to $244.8 million.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment are likely to improve driven by continuous expansion of its verification business with progressive work culture and increasing associations, coupled with global expansion into Canadian and Australian markets. Within the segment, the Employer Services unit is likely to witness increase in hiring and on-boarding solutions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $212 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues climbed 6% year over year to $183.4 million (inclusive of 11% sales growth in Verification Services and 5% decline at Employer Services).Revenues from USIS division are expected to decline owing to a decline in mortgage market activity and the negative impact of the cybersecurity incident. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $306 million, reflecting year-over-year decline of 1.3%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues suffered a 1% year-over-year decline to $313 million.Revenues from Global Consumer Solutions segment are likely to get affected by a declining subscriber base.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $93 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.3%. In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues amounted to $97.3 million, down 2% year over year.Strength across International and Workforce Solutions segments will contribute toward year-over-year growth of Equifax’s total revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is currently pegged at $854.02 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.6%.Notably, the consensus estimate falls within the company guided range of $850-$860 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 2-3%. The guidance also includes a 1% benefit from foreign currency movements. In fourth-quarter 2017, revenues rose 4.7% from the year-ago quarter to $838.5 million. It included a 3% negative impact of the cybersecurity incident.Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Equifax, Inc. QuoteBottom Line to Decline Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.37, indicating year-over-year decline of 4.9%.The decline is expected on the back of buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the investigation, rectification, legal and professional services and improved security services in relation to the cybersecurity incident. Reduced benefits from foreign tax items are likely to act as another negative catalyst. Notably, these headwinds are expected to offset the tax benefits from the new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) law.Notably, the consensus estimate is in line with the midpoint of the previous guidance range. Equifax anticipates EPS for first-quarter 2018 to be in the range of $1.34-$1.39 (inclusive of a benefit of 1 cent from foreign currency movements).

Currently, TransUnion has more than 50 petabytes of data, growing at an average of over 25% annually since 2010.

1709,FLT,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Genpact (G  -  Free Report), a stock that has rallied 12.3% over the past year. The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%.We believe strong prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) space and strategic acquisitions bode well for the company.Let’s delve deeper in to these key factors.Very Active on the Acquisition FontAcquisition is a key growth strategy for Genpact. We believe, buyouts of TandemSeven, BrightClaim and Rage Frameworks in 2017 are helping the company to expand product portfolio and gain new domain expertise.The addition of TandemSeven’s core design thinking process to Genpact’s AI platform is helping Genpact become more customer-oriented company. Acquisition of BrightClaim and their associated company, National Vendor, should also strengthen Genpact’s insurance claims management expertise. Rage Frameworks buyout expanded Genpact’s capability to provide AI offerings across industries, such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact’s other notable acquisitions include LeaseDimensions, Endeavour Software, Strategic Sourcing Excellence (SSE), PNMSoft Limited, Hitachi Management and Pharmalink Consulting. These buyouts have helped the company in expanding presence in mobile technology, dynamic workflow solution, life sciences and banking operations. These, in turn, have driven customer base and top-line growth.Artificial Intelligence Offering Significant Growth OpportunitiesPer an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to touch $52.2 billion in 2021 witnessing a CAGR of 46.2%.  We believe that Genpact is well positioned to take advantage of the projected improvement in the AI space.The company recently launched Genpact Cora -- an automation to AI-based platform that combines its proprietary automation, analytics, and AI technologies into a single common platform. This latest platform has a modular, interconnected network of technologies that enables clients to better tackle specific operational business challenges.Genpact Cora is helping the company to provide related offerings to industries like consumer-packaged goods, industrial engineering, life sciences and high tech.

1710,FLT,"Outsourcing is the practice of handling over the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis.Despite multiple tailwinds, outsourcing services have certain disadvantages. Companies need to constantly negotiate terms with their third-party contractors to enjoy easy services. At times, third-party vendors need to access the company’s internal data for proper functioning and this is where the security factor comes in. Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stock — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.71 billion, Automatic Data Processing’s market cap is $61.36 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with an VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP in terms investment attractiveness. ADP has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over ADP, considering its price performance in a year’s time. Shares of Broadridge have gained 54.6%, outperforming the S&P 500’s and industry’s rally of 13.7% and 25.2%, respectively. ADP has gained 37.6%, underperforming both the S&P 500 Composite and the industry. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.ADP’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 38.5% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  However, for full-year 2018, the situation is just the opposite with ADP’s expected earnings growth rate of 16.8% being lower than Broadridge’s growth rate of 34.5%.For 2019, ADP’s earnings are expected to register 12% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.3% for ADP is higher than Broadridge’s growth rate of 10%.While Broadridge’s earnings are expected to grow higher than ADP in 2018, the situation is expected to reverse in 2019 and the long term.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on the earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and full-year 2018 and 2019, in the last 60 days, ADP appears to be more favorably placed.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings improved 9.8% for ADP against a decrease of 2.1% for Broadridge.For 2018, the consensus estimate improved 4.3% for ADP and 4.2% for Broadridge. Estimates for 2019 moved up 3.4% for ADP and 2% for Broadridge.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge and ADP have an impressive earning surprise history, with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters.However, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP as it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.6% as against 5.2% for the latter.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 13.6%, ADP not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and ADP is 28.8 and 34.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 28.3. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Broadridge and ADP have EV/EBITDA ratios of 16.3 and 21.0, respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 13.6. Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Broadridge is better positioned with a lower EV/EBITDA value. Though both the stocks look overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge is undervalued compared to ADP.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. The trailing 12-month ROE for Broadridge and ADP is 45.3% and 45.7%, respectively, while that of the industry is 34.7%. Although both the companies clearly score above the industry, ADP is a better choice than Broadridge with a higher ROE. Return on Capital (ROC) for Broadridge and ADP is 21.3% and 30.4%, respectively, while the industry’s ROC stands at 22.9%. This implies that ADP generates a higher return on investment than its industry.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge is superior than ADP when considering price performance, valuation and earnings history. ADP scores over Broadridge in terms of net margin, long-term expected earnings growth, earnings estimate revisions, return on capital and equity.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). While Mastercard sports a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX carry a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for Mastercard, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX is 19%, 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1711,FLT,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Waste Connections, Inc. (WCN  -  Free Report), a stock with a Growth Score of B and an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 13.3%.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 9.3% compared with the 1.5% increase of the industry it belongs to. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s benefits from acquisitions and strong hold in secondary and rural markets.Let’s discuss them in detail.Early Mover AdvantageWaste Connections typically targets secondary and rural markets to garner a higher local market share, which would be difficult to attain in more competitive urban markets. This, in turn, decreases the company’s exposure to customer churn and helps improve financial returns. In fact, earlymover advantage in certain rural basins play a key role in improving market positioning and generating higher financial returns, given the limited availability of existing third-party-owned waste disposal alternatives.The company focuses on increasing market penetration and offering additional services to capitalize on future drilling opportunities in those areas. Waste Connections also aims to leverage its franchise-based platforms for expanding customer base beyond the exclusive market territories.Prime Location AdvantageWith prime location of disposal sites within competitive markets, Waste Connections has optimal asset positioning to generate higher profitability. Given significant costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity proximate to the waste stream offer a competitive advantage and serve as a barrier to entry. An experienced management team, decentralized operating strategy and financial strength are additional tailwinds.Acquisitions Driving GrowthWaste Connections continues to grow with the help of acquisitions in both new and existing markets. It follows a strategic combination of financial, market and management criteria to evaluate opportunities from acquisitions. In new markets, the company uses its initial buyout as an operating base and seeks to strengthen the acquired operation's presence by providing additional services, adding customers and making “tuck-in” acquisitions of other waste companies in that market or adjacent markets.Waste Connections remains highly optimistic about “tuck-in” acquisition opportunities within its current and targeted market areas as these can help increase market share. In 2017, the company completed 14 acquisitions for a net fair value of $562.2 million.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWaste Connections currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report).

1712,FLT,"A prudent investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time while selling those that are at risk. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock’s bullish run.Delphi Technologies PLC (DLPH  -  Free Report) is a technology service stock that has performed well in the past three months and has the potential to sustain the momentum in the near term. Consequently, if you haven’t taken advantage of its share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.What Makes it an Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past three months. Shares of Delphi Technologies have returned 9.7%, which compares favorably with the S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 0.4%.  Solid Rank & VGM Score: Delphi Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Growth Momentum Score (VGM Score) of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings increased 1.6%. Estimates for 2018 and 2019 moved up 1.6% and 5.8%, respectively, over the same time frame.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Delphi Technologies has a decent earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 11.9%.Strong Growth Prospects: The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10%. Moreover, earnings are expected to grow 10.4% in 2019.Growth Factors: Delphi Technologies looks strong on the back of its vast geographic presence. The company operates in 24 countries, managing technical centers, manufacturing sites and customer support services. In 2017, it generated 72% of its net revenues from sales outside the United States. Region-wise, it is highly optimistic about opportunities from the Asia Pacific. Notably, net sales from this region grew almost 28% to $1.34 billion from 2015-2017. Asia Pacific can be considered as a key growth market, driven by increasing levels of vehicle production.Delphi Technologies’ regional presence coupled with its diversified and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies should help it become a solid choice for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This is because OEMS are focused on increasing efficiency and expanding their global manufacturing footprint by choosing suppliers with global scale who can easily adapt to regional variations. In 2017, within Powertrain Systems, 62% of net sales came from light vehicle OEM customers and 19% from commercial vehicle OEM customers. Additionally, in 2017, global vehicle production (including light and commercial vehicles) increased 3% from the previous year, including increases of 4% in Europe, 3% in China and 21% in South America. Meanwhile, global vehicle production is also expected to rise further in the OEM market, thereby opening up more opportunities for Delphi Technologies.Delphi Technologies’ growing cash position implies management’s efficient execution in recent times. In 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $338 million, which compares favorably with $101 million and $108 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively in 2016 and 2015. Further, the company generated $389 million of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $372 million in 2016. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy.

The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s continuous internal growth increasing operational efficiency.Let’s discuss them in detail.Continuous Internal Growth via Long-Term ContractsRepublic Services continues to grow internally with the help of long-term contracts for the collection, recycling and disposal of solid waste materials. Such agreements increase the company’s contracted revenue base, thereby strengthening its market position.Further, the company continues to look out for strategic price improvement in order to offset increased costs and enjoy an appropriate return on its substantial investments in vehicles, equipment, landfills, transfer stations and recycling centers.

Revenue (TTM) | Republic Services, Inc. QuoteIncreased Focus on Operational EfficiencyRepublic Services is focused on improving its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles and converting rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will reduce cost and improve profitability.

1725,FLT,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19. Notably, the top- and bottom-line results of this leading staffing solutions provider surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to ExpectThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has been stable over the past 30 days at 73 cents. Projected earnings for the quarter depict year-over-year growth of 17.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,358 million to be up 5.5% year over year.The company expects revenues in the range of $1,335-$1,395 million for the said quarter. In addition, it envisions earnings in the range of 70-76 cents per share. Encouragingly, the mid-point of these projections reflects year-over-year top-line (constant currency) and bottom-line growth of 4.2% and 18%, respectively.Notably, shares of Robert Half International have surged 32% over the past year, outperforming the 25.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. Factors at PlayRobert Half’s international revenues have been increasing, courtesy of rising demand for professional staffing services. In fact, this has been a persistent trend since the first quarter of 2014. Also, the company’s temporary staffing services have been on the rise globally. This is because employers are building flexible staffing options in human resources plans.Robert Half International Inc. Revenue (TTM) Robert Half International Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Robert Half International Inc. Quote In the meantime, the company has been investing heavily in tapping the evolving prospects in the technology staffing area, over the past few years. Such efforts are likely to continue favoring the company’s international revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral staffing revenues from international regions jumped 15% from the prior-year quarter. Also, international revenues grew 23% year on year in the Protiviti segment.Furthermore, the latest tax reforms in the United States are expected to increase hiring activities. The benefits from lower tax rates may propel companies to allocate more capital for increasing headcount to support business growth. This, in turn, might significantly bolster Robert Half’s business in the forthcoming periods. These factors along with an overall improved economic scenario in the United States, encourages management about growth in the upcoming quarters. Moreover, the company’s investments in digital technology are expected to enhance service offerings to clients and candidates both in the United States and internationally.Notably, in the fourth quarter, temporary and consulting staffing revenues improved 5.8% in December and 2% in the first two weeks of October.

1727,FLT,"Steady sales growth holds the key to survival in an ever changing and highly competitive business environment. But when it comes to picking stocks, investors often ignore sales growth as a dependable metric. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum.But it’s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur losses, albeit temporarily, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Further, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense control measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, sustainable bottom-line growth invariably requires higher revenues.Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can be an apt metric for stock valuation. The importance of this metric lies in the fact that management has limited scope to manipulate revenues unlike earnings.While sales growth provides investors an understanding of product demand and pricing power, it doesn’t reflect whether the company is operating efficiently. A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.So, a consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) operates, franchises, and licenses hotel, residential, and timeshare properties.

1729,FLT,"Visa Inc.'s (V  -  Free Report) fiscal first-quarter earnings should see an upside from increased payment transactions. Transactions processed on Visa cards have been on a rise from past many years, which is directly proportional to the company’s revenue growth. Visa makes money in two ways. First, they get a fixed amount on all money that is spent using their co-branded cards. Their second stream of revenues is from Data Processing, which means facilitating the transaction and settlement of transactions.A strong economy fuelled consumer spending which should have aided payment transaction growth. Also, continued growth of checks and digital payment methods supported increase in payment transactions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total payment transaction is 39.25 billion, up 11.2% year over year. This should be driven by payments transaction growth from Asia Pacific, Canada, Cemea, Lac and United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific, Canada, Cemea, Lac and United States are pegged at 6.4 billion, 850 million, 3.58 billion, 3.32 billion and 16.55 billion, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increase of 13.9%, 10%, 26.8%, 5.3% and 8.2%.Overall Visa’s earnings are likely to reflect solid revenue growth led by factors such as increased spending as the economy continues to grow and shift toward spending on cards and increased pricing.Growth in processed transaction is likely to push up Data Processing fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2 billion, up 20% year over year.Also, lower-than-expected incentives must have aided margins, as Visa has slightly delayed moving some European clients to an incentive structure. A moderation in the exchange drag will also aid margins.  The company has accelerated share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Increased share buyback will provide an added shield to its bottom line.

Revenues of $339.9 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a slight margin and increased 8.9% year over year.Despite such impressive results, we observe that shares of FactSet have rallied 18.8% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rise of 25.5%. Higher Annual Subscription ValueFactSet is witnessing growth in its Annual Subscription Value (ASV), driven by new client additions. The company added 80 new clients in third-quarter fiscal 2018, taking the total to 4,975. The company’s ASV increased 6.3% and reached $1.36 billion as of May 31, 2018. Organically, it increased $9 million during the quarter.Further, FactSet’s ASV reported robust growth on the basis of region. ASV generated $843.6 million revenues from the United States, up 4.4% from the prior-year quarter as well as organically. Internationally, ASV derived $512.6 million revenues, up 8.1% on a reported basis and 6.7% organically. While 13% growth was observed from the Asia-Pac region, Europe grew at a rate of 5%.The company's proprietary content revenues are expected to gain momentum in the quarters ahead, attributable to stronger demand driven by the company's competitive pricing strategy. We believe that its growing customer base, solid revenue growth, coupled with high client retention rate (90%) and a competitive pricing strategy, will positively impact results over the long term.Robust Organic GrowthFactSet continues to grow organically. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, organic revenues grew 5.7% to $332.5 million on the back of accelerated sales of content and technology solutions (CTS), analytics products and wealth management solutions. Region-wise,FactSet reported 5% organic growth from the United States and 6.9% internationally. The uptrend was due to higher sales from international price increase and analytics, data feed products along with a rise in workstation sales. FactSet’s ASV organic growth rate was 5.3% in the reported quarter.Expanding Global FootprintFactSet is strengthening its presence in the Asia Pacific region with the opening of a new office in Shanghai, China on May 31. With the opening, FactSet can now offer its data and analytic solutions to the growing number of investors and investment managers in China who seek better tools to aid them in their investment. FactSet has been working with the Chinese investment community since 1996.Additionally, the company’s ASV recorded 13% organic growth from the Asia-Pac region in third-quarter fiscal 2018. The region witnessed new client addition and higher sales to existing clients particularly in Singapore and Australia. Growth across both fixed income and equity products and Content & Technology Solutions (CTS) products boosted its analytical suite.We believe all these factors will perfectly complement the robust growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite contributing only 8% to total revenues, the Asia-Pacific region recorded marked improvement over the past two years. Revenues grew almost 40% from fiscal 2015 ($76.5 million) to fiscal 2017 ($106.7 million). The Asia Pacific segment operates offices in Australia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and Shanghai.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, FactSet’s ASV recorded 5% organic growth from Europe. The company enjoyed major gains from the region in analytics, CTS and an increase in workstation sales. The UK and Nordic regions reported robust performance. Notably, FactSet generates around 25-27% of revenues from Europe. The European segment operates offices in Bulgaria, Dubai, England, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.Strong Product Suite Across AnalyticsFactSet is highly optimistic about the integrated data-related products and services within its analytical suite, which it offers to the investment community. With the market adapting a quantitative approach to save time, reduce operating expenses and increase work efficiency, FactSet’s innovative analytical product suite should benefit.  To this end, FactSet’s recent launch of Open: FactSet Marketplace looks exciting. Open:FactSet Marketplace is a new online platform, which offers both core financial and alternative datasets to address the growing demand for integrated data. The company believes that this new platform will boost its CTS suite  next year.RisksDespite such tailwinds, FactSet continues to face stiff competition from other players providing financial market data, analytics and related services. These competitors may be able to expand their offerings and data content more effectively, price their products more aggressively or respond more rapidly to situations developing in the marketplace.Additionally, FactSet’s balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of May 31, 2018, long-term debt was $574.74 million compared with $574.70 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $213.1 million compared with $233.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Such a cash position implies that FactSet needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company’s future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFactSet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s efforts to capitalize on these opportunities by periodically introducing products and services for its clients and by moving into the mid-market arena have paid off. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018,HRS segment revenues climbed 17% year over year to $401 million, mainly owing to a rise in human capital management (HCM) services clients. The HCM services include comprehensive HR outsourcing services, comprising HROI, time and attendance, retirement services and insurance services.

1735,FLT,"ManpowerGroup Inc. (MAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell.We expect ManpowerGroup to witness strong revenue growth on the back of improved recruitment solutions, improvements in the labor market with optimistic hiring outlookand a strong U.S. economy. Moreover, earnings are likely to be driven by lower tax rates and favorable foreign currency movements.We observe that shares of ManpowerGroup have rallied 14.6% in the past year compared with the S&P 500’s and industry’s gain of 16.0% and 26.1%, respectively. Here are the expectations in detail.Constant Currency Growth & Improved Hiring to Drive RevenuesManpowerGroup has five reporting segments, primarily on a geographic basis: Americas, Southern Europe, Northern Europe, APME (Asia Pacific Middle East) and Right Management. While we expect strong performance of Northern Europe, Southern Europe and APME segments in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, the company’s business from Americas and Right Management are likely to decline.Southern Europe is likely to witness improved revenues driven by growth in permanent recruitment and strong businesses across France and Italy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $2,272 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 25.9%. Revenues from this segment increased 25.5% year over year to $2,399 million in fourth-quarter 2017. With France, Italy and Other Southern Europe in its coverage, the segment contributes around 41-42% of total revenues.Revenues from Northern Europe are expected to increase on the back of strong growth in both Poland and Russia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,397 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 12.8%. In fourth-quarter 2017, the segment reported $1,418.1 million in revenues (up 9.7% year over year). The segment accounts for almost 25-26% of total revenues.The APME segment is also likely to witness an uptrend in revenues backed by growth in greater China and other APME countries. The consensus estimate for the segment stands at $645 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2%. Revenues from this segment increased 10.4% year over year to $695.2 million in fourth-quarter 2017. It contributes 12% of total revenues.Revenues generated from Americas are expected to decrease year over year due to lower revenues from its Experis business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,005 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 2%. In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues amounted to $1,071.8 million, up 0.8% year over year. The segment accounts for almost 19-20% of total revenues.Revenues from the Right Management business are anticipated to decline to $51 million in first-quarter 2018 due to the persistent declines in career placement activities. Revenues had declined 8.9% year over year infourth-quarter 2017. The segment accounts for hardly 1% of total revenues.Strength across Northern Europe, Southern Europe and APME segments will contribute significantly toward year-over-year growth of ManpowerGroup’s total revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is currently pegged at $5,377 million, representing year-over-year increase of 13%. In fourth-quarter 2017, revenue rose 13.7% from the year-ago quarter to $5,637.5 million.ManpowerGroup Revenue (TTM)  ManpowerGroup Revenue (TTM) | ManpowerGroup QuoteManpowerGroup looks well poised on the back of skilled professionals, technological advancements, brand value and strong global network. Additionally, Trump administration’s business-friendly approach, a strong U.S. economy, robust manufacturing activity and improvements in the labor market are currently major positives for the overall Business Services sector.Fed has raised its forecast for 2018 GDP growth to 2.7% from 2.5% in December 2017, highlighting the strong fundamentals of the economy. Currently, unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of around 4.1%.  Also, the unemployment rate is projected to remain stable at 3.6% in 2019 and 2020, better than the central bank’s earlier projection of 3.9% and 4%, respectively. This indicates that the U.S. labor market will maintain nearly full employment levels in the 2018-2020 time frame.Per ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey released on Dec 12, 2017, employers in 41 countries (out of 43) showed positive hiring intentions for first-quarter 2018. With a survey of more than 11,500 U.S. employers, the seasonally adjusted Net Employment Outlook for the first quarter of 2018 was up 19%. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter with an outlook of more than 15% or higher.Given the lower unemployment levels and U.S. employers on a hiring spree, staffing companies stand to gain the most.Tax Cut & Favorable Currency to Boost EarningsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 51.4%. We expect the company to witness bottom-line growth on the back of lower tax rates and favorable foreign currency movements.Notably, the consensus estimate exceeded the midpoint of the previous guidance range by 1 cent. ManpowerGroup anticipates EPS for first-quarter 2018 to be in the range of $1.60-$1.68. The guidance includes a positive impact of 20 cents from the tax cut and 15 cents from foreign currency. The same factors had also positively impacted the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings rose 17.8% from the year-ago quarter to $2.12 per share.Our Model Suggests a BeatAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.

The Work Number database — a product of Equifax Verification Services — is one of the nation’s largest sources of authentic employment and income information with a current database of more than 5,500 employers from all over the United States.This is an initiative taken up by Equifax to aid the mortgage industry which is trying to adapt to consumer preferences and get more digitalized to strengthen its position.The Work Number Indicator, which comes with a credit report, provides lenders access to the current employment and income status of their borrowers, in order to help them analyze the latter’s payback ability. This not only saves time by avoiding the elaborate documentation process involved in granting a loan but also increases work efficiency, thereby making customer dealings easier than before. The indicator maintains a record of any changes in employment on any customer or client portfolio.Notably, Equifax’s The Work Number seems to have gained popularity in the market. On Apr 10, 2018, AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation reported a 15% improvement in mortgage origination efficiency by utilizing The Work Number report for verification of employment and income (VOE/VOI). On Jan 27, 2017, Equifax and Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) had collaborated to ease out the loan approval process by linking Equifax’s The Work Number with Fiserv's Automotive Loan Origination System.Bottom Line The offering is expected to complement Equifax’s growing Verification Services, thereby boosting its Workforce Solutions segment. The Workforce Solutions segment accounts for nearly 22-23% of Equifax’s total yearly revenues.In 2017, Verification Services contributed the largest chunk (around 66%) to Workforce Solutions revenues. Verification Services revenues increased almost 38% from $364.4 million in 2015 to $501.5 million in 2017. Additionally, in first-quarter 2018, the service reported 12% growth from the year-ago quarter due to robust government, financial, mortgage, and pre-employment activities along with continuous addition of new records to The Work Number database.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1740,FLT,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding (BAH  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11.6% over the past month. BAH hit a new 52-week high of $44.17 in the previous session. Booz Allen Hamilton has gained 15.5% since the start of the year compared to the 8.5% move for the Business Services sector and the 4.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 29, 2018, Booz Allen Hamilton reported EPS of $0.52 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 2.5%.Valuation MetricsWhile BAH has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.6X versus its peer group's average of 14.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus | Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Booz Allen Hamilton Holding meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though BAH shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Dun & Bradstreet (DNB  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), and FleetCor Technologies (FLT  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 17% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BAH, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

1741,FLT,"Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire TMC Bonds LLC for $685 million in cash. The transaction, pending regulatory approval, is expected to culminate in the second half of 2017.TMC Bonds, a premier fixed income marketplace, was established in 2000. The trading platform facilitates click-to-trade and request-for-quote in asset classes like Municipals, Corporates, Treasuries, Agencies and Certificates of Deposit.The addition of TMC Bonds will consolidate Intercontinental Exchange’s fixed income market trading. The acquirer will benefit from TMC Bonds’ new and complementary access point to liquidity for customers. Also, the buyout will expand Intercontinental Exchange’s portfolio of diverse solutions in the global fixed income markets across analytics, execution and post-trade.Nonetheless, the acquisition is unlikely to impact results or capital returns in 2018.On the other hand, TMC Bonds will enjoy superior workflow solutions by deploying Intercontinental Exchange’s compelling data and analytics.Carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Intercontinental Exchange as a securities exchange has a solid track of strategic buyouts, including TMX Atrium, National Stock Exchange and VirtuBondPoint among others. Several strategic acquisitions have not only expanded Intercontinental Exchange, but have also resulted in expense synergies. Management is on track to achieve at least $30 million in expense synergies by the end of this year.The most significant of these deals is the acquisition of NYSE in Nov 2013, which cemented Intercontinental Exchange’s position as a premier stock trading platform. The takeover also transformed the company into the second-largest global exchange group, thus allowing over 60% accretion in market capitalization.Per ICE President Benjamin Jackson, “the fixed income markets continue to automate and migrate to electronic trading.” The move to acquire TMC Bonds thus bears a testimony to the diversifying aims of the company to emerge in rapidly growing markets.Shares of Intercontinental Exchange have rallied 17.4% in a year, compared with the industry’s gain of 30%. We expect successful integration of acquisitions, organic growth initiatives, strong operational performance and solid capital position to drive its shares higher.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Cardtronics PLC (CATM  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc.

1744,FLT,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the opening bell.We expect an increase in net revenues primarily driven by increases across its revenue categories, accretive impact of acquisitions, higher switched transactions and increase in gross dollar volumes. The revenue growth, however, will be offset to a large extent by higher operating and personnel expenses reflecting continued investment in strategic initiatives.Factors Likely to Impact Fourth-Quarter Earnings:Increase in Rebates and Incentives: Rebates and incentives (recorded as contra-revenues) increase in the first nine months of  2017 and the same trend is expected to be seen in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements, and increased volumes.Expanding Service Business: The company's efforts in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, are its differentiators in the market. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.Higher Gross Dollar Volume: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gross Dollar volume which measures all Mastercard Credit Charge and Debit programs, and includes purchase volume plus cash volume, one of the main revenue drivers, is expected to be $1.36 trillion, up almost 11% year over year.Growth in Different Areas, Product Launch, Deals and Partnerships:  Fourth-quarter results would manifest the company’s targeted growth from its card offerings in different verticals — consumer credit, debit and commercial prepaid. Its continued investments in physical-digital convergence will keep it ahead in an industry witnessing rapid technology usage and accrue to its top line. Also, several new deals, extension of partnerships and agreements, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard's top line.Other FactorsMasterCard’s top line in the fourth quarter would gain traction from its massive international business.The company's disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company's bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international markets (accounting for more than 60% of the company’s revenues) than in the prior year.MasterCard’s use of capital in buying back shares will provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.84%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mastercard Inc.

1745,FLT,"Visa Inc.’s (V  -  Free Report) fiscal first-quarter results scheduled for Feb 1, should see an upside from increased revenues.Visa has witnessed a revenue CAGR of 12.7% from 2008-2017. We strongly believe that the company will retain its revenue momentum in the fiscal first quarter on the back of its strong market position and attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The company expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis for fiscal 2018. We expect increase in revenues from each of its business lines — Data Processing, International Transaction and Service. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of these segments is pegged at $2.1 billion, $1.67 billion and $2.1 billion, up 13.3%, 12.4% and 11.2% year over year, respectively.  The company resolved approximately 75% of contract conversions by the end of fiscal 2017, and the remainder will be done primarily in the first half of fiscal 2018. As a result, client incentives in the first half of 2018 will be significantly higher than fiscal 2017. Thus the quarter should enclose higher client incentives.Payment volumes should grow in the fiscal first quarter from the Costco and USAA deal wins. These deals drove U.S. payment volume growth up to the double-digit range in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 trillion payment volumes is up 9.3% year over year.The company’s cross-border business and cross-border volumes are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the pound. In the fourth quarter, these trends started to change as the dollar weakened, especially versus the euro and the pound. Assuming these trends will continue, the company anticipates a slowdown in U.S. outbound commerce, with a step up in commerce coming into the U.S. and vice-versa for Europe and the UK.    The adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter led by numerous investment initiatives.The company has accelerated share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Increased share buyback will provide an added shield to its bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history.

(on Jan 17, 2017), PCLender, LLC (on Jul 31, 2017), Dovetail Group Limited (on Aug 18, 2017) and Monitise plc (on Sep 1, 2017). Thesebuyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform payments infrastructure.In 2016, Fiserv acquired two businesses - Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Companyand Community Financial Services businessof ACI Worldwide, Inc. Both these buyouts expanded Fiserv’s biller solution offerings and enhanced its digital banking and payments solutions suite.Considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking services, investment in digital-oriented technologies through strategic acquisitions should boost Fiserv’s long-term growth and improve competitiveness.We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base going forward. The company is focused into becoming a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions.PartnershipsFiserv continues to make prudent business moves.

On Apr 19,2018, Fiservannounced its partnership with SISCOOP to enable 26 Mexican credit unions to offer a full range of secured digital banking and payment services using Fiserv’s DigitalAccess technology. This came on the heels of Fiserv’s foray into digital transformation with Carter Bank & Trust of Martinsville, announced on Apr 9, 2018. The bank will use the Digital Edge suite from Fiserv to digitalize banking services and automate multiple manual processes as part of a strategic transformation.Business Sale Fiserv continues to profit from offloading assets. In first-quarter 2018, Fiserv sold its 55% stake in Lending Solutions business to funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC. Fiserv received total sale proceeds of $419 million from the deal. The company will retain the remaining 45% stake in the Lending Solutions business.  On Jan 10, it completed the sale of the retail voucher business, MyVoucherCodes (acquired as part of its purchase of Monitise in September 2017) for $50 million. On May 11, 2017, Fiserv sold its Australian item processing business for approximately $17 million.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Fiserv’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In first-quarter 2018, Fiserv repurchased 5.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of $398 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, it had 15.8 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

1747,FLT,"Mastercard Inc.

Given the increased usage of mobile phones in our everyday lives from making online purchases, bill payments, online banking and much more, this technology is now being applied to ATMs to make cash transactions easy for consumers. In essence, mobile payment methods hold the centre stage in the redesigning of traditional ATMs to one that can provide innovative services as per changing needs.Mastercard senses huge opportunity in mobile technology and the recent pact is in sync with the company’s goal of making it big in this burgeoning space.In a year’s time the stock has gained 57% outperforming the industry’s growth of 35%.Another company in the same space Visa Inc.

1748,FLT,"The thriving U.S. economy should benefit Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report). Favorable factors like record low unemployment rate, strong customer confidence, steady wage growth and financial flexibility in consumer hands from a reduced tax rate bode well for business growth at this payment and network processor company.Most recent data on retail sales for April showed that the value of sales inched up 0.3%, matching the median forecast after a 0.8% rise in March. April retail sales hinted at firm consumer demand as fatter paychecks more than offset the effect of rising fuel costs.The recent positive sales trend is expected to continue as consumer reliance on the company remains sturdy amid a progressing U.S. economy.     These developments  augur well for Visa with fast digital transformation in shopping and an increase in usage of credit and debit cards for making payment for purchases. Revenue growth for Visa is directly proportional to its consumer spending level. The same is reflected in the company’s results for the first half of fiscal 2018, which witnessed an 11% year-over-year rise in net revenues to $9.9 billion. This upside mirrored consistent growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume as well as nominal cross-border volume.In a year's time, the stock has gained 36% compared with the industry's growth of 33%.Per Visa’s second-quarter fiscal report, its payments volume on a constant dollar basis expanded 11%, driven by a strong global economy. U.S. payments volume grew on the back of strength across retail and every day spend segments as well as continued solid growth in travel categories.Another company in the same space — Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) — experiences overall growth from low employment, healthy consumer confidence and robust retail spending. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) in the first quarter (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) extended 10%, up 1% from fourth quarter and was made up of Credit and Debit growth of 9% and 12%, respectively.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVisa carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1749,FLT,"Retail sales increased in April, driven by wage growth, increased financial flexibility owing to the recent tax reform and a record-low unemployment rate.Details from Commerce Department revealed that retail sales improved 4.7% in April. This was driven by an increase in receipts at gasoline stations as well as sales at clothing & clothing accessories, furniture and home furnishing, food and beverage stores, and building material. This was the second straight month of increase in sales after muted  performance in January and February, which was basically driven by the halt in spending by consumers due to a delay in tax refunds.Nevertheless, the recent positive sales trend is expected to continue as consumer confidence stays strong, amid a thriving U.S. economy.     These developments bode well for the payment and network processors, with digital transformation in shopping and increase in usage of cards for making payments for purchases. Revenue growth for companies in this industry is directly proportional to the level of consumer spending. Therefore it makes good sense to invest in stocks from this space.Let us look at some of the factors which would act as catalysts to for the industry’s growth:Strong Consumer ConfidenceThe Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ attitude to current and short-term economic conditions (next six months), rose in April, following a decline in March. The index now stands at 128.7, up from 127.0 in March.What underlies the surge in the index is consumers’ belief that the cadence of growth witnessed recently will continue. This has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases. This surely is a welcome sign for payment and network, which are the end beneficiaries of rising consumer spending and confidence.Higher Gasoline Prices to Increase Spending on CardsProduction cuts by OPEC, elevated demand and geo political tensions fueled an increase in the price of oil. Gasoline prices are expected to remain at elevated levels now that President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and imposed tougher sanctions on Theran.Payment processors and card companies like Visa, Mastercard, American Express gain on an increase in gasoline prices because of the higher transaction amount spent each time the card is swiped. Moreover Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Mastercard, American Express branded cards provides rewards in the form of rebates to the card holders on gas purchases, thus defraying a part of their oil bill. Owing to the lucrative rebates these cards are greatly used at pumping stations, which in turn increases the business volume for card companies, processers and payment networks.Since oil price is set to move northward, we expect the trend to continue to favor the stocks in this space.Upside From Tax ReformThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act should be a positive for the financial services industry. A reduction in the tax rate has provided businesses with an increased capacity to invest, and consumers will have more disposable income to splurge on purchases.Corporations are making several focused investments that build on their long-standing commitment to strengthen their business, support its people, while continuing to provide strong capital returns to its shareholders.One of the industry leaders Mastercard Inc. has on its agenda additional investments in its center for inclusive growth, which it launched back in 2014 as a way to focus its data, expertise, technology and philosophic investments to support inclusive growth. Visa has plans to make strategic investments in the areas of digital products, technology operations and merchant solutions.Network and Payment Processors Set to GainA thriving economy is favoring the payment and the network processors Visa in its fiscal second quarter disclosed that its payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, driven by a strong global economy. U.S. payments volume grew led by strength across retail and every day spend segments as well as continued strong growth in travel categories.Another major company, Mastercard, said that it is witnessing overall growth from low employment, healthy consumer confidence and strong retail spending. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) grew 10%, up 1% from last quarter, and was made up of Credit and Debit growth of 9% and 12%, respectively.The financial transaction services industry has indeed put up a good show rising 38% in a year’s time more than double the S&P 500 index growth of 17%.Some Attractive Stocks in This SpaceGiven the strong macro backdrop, investing in this space should yield attractive returns.  Based on certain parameters, we have zeroed in on three stocks with a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks have seen an upward revision in earnings estimates and have also outperformed the industry’s growth of 38% in a year’s time.  Our PicksMastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is  a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FLT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.42% heading into earnings season.FleetCor Technologies, Inc.

1751,FLT,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30, 2018, after the closing bell. Notably, the top- and bottom-line results of this leading staffing solutions provider have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the fourth quarter and 2017 has been stable over the past 30 days at 63 cents and $2.58, respectively. Projected earnings for the fourth quarter depict year-over-year growth of 3.2%, while the same for the year shows a decline of 3.4%, respectively.However, management expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 29-39 cents per share after considering the impacts of the latest tax reforms. This includes one-time charges of approximately $34-38 million (amounting to nearly 27-31 cents per share) to its provision for income taxes.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,312 million for the fourth quarter, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Robert Half International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Robert Half International Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayInternational Revenues Expected to RiseRobert Half’s international revenues have been surging, courtesy of rising demand for professional staffing services. This has been a persistent trend since the first quarter of 2014. Further, the company’s temporary staffing services have been on the rise globally, as employers are building flexible staffing options in human resources plans. The company has been investing heavily in tapping the evolving prospects in the technology staffing area, over the past few years.Driven by such efforts, international revenue growth, mainly from the European regions provided some cushion to Robert Half’s otherwise soft figures in third-quarter 2017. During the quarter, currency-neutral staffing revenues from international regions jumped 11% from the prior-year quarter. Also, international revenues grew 12% year on year in the Protiviti segment.Such trends are likely to continue favoring the company’s international revenues during the fourth quarter as well.Trends in the United States Bode WellMoving on, while Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management stated that trends improved in September 2017 and continued till October 2017. Evidently, temporary and consulting staffing revenues improved 2.1% in September and 2% in the first two weeks of October. Also, permanent placement revenues advanced 7.2% in September, while it surged 21% in the first three weeks of October.Moreover, the latest tax reforms in the United States are expected to increase hiring activities. The benefits from lower tax rates may propel companies to allocate more capital for increasing headcount to support business growth. This can significantly bolster Robert Half’s business in the forthcoming periods.  These factors along with an overall improved economic scenario in the United States, encourages management about growth in the forthcoming periods. Moreover, the company’s investments in digital technology are expected to enhance service offerings to clients and candidates both in the United States and internationally.  Headwinds Likely to Weigh on PerformanceRobert Half’s Protiviti segment has been witnessing declining operating margins since the beginning of the year 2016. This is due to lower gross margins and a lesser number of higher margin clients. Third-quarter gross margin for Protiviti declined 130 basis points to 29.6%, which dented the company's profits. Also, this segment witnessed revenue drop of about 4% to $209 million in the quarter.All said, let’s wait and see if the aforementioned growth drivers can help Robert Half offset these headwinds in the quarter to be reported.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Robert Half is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Robert Half carries a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

1752,FLT,"Shares of data and analytics solutions provider, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $57.23 in yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $56.68 for a solid one-year return of 77.1%. Barring minor hiccups, the company’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since mid-September last year. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectations of 10% and looks poised to touch new highs in 2018.Growth DriversTransUnion has an attractive business model with highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong and stable cash flow. The company’s gigantic treasure trove of data is its most distinguishing asset and is perhaps the biggest barrier to entry for competitors. TransUnion has more than 30 petabytes of data, growing at an average of above 25% annually since 2010. Acquiring or building such data involves huge costs, making it extremely difficult for a new company to build the contacts and data that TransUnion already has. This fortifies its ability to sustain competitive advantage and protect its market share, enabling it to maintain a healthy growth momentum.TransUnion’s addressable market includes the burgeoning Big Data and analytics, which is expanding rapidly as companies comprehend the advantages of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are derived from data and insights. Numerous underlying trends are supporting this market growth, including the creation of massive amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that allow data to be processed more swiftly and efficiently for key insights across industries and geographies.The inherent nature and significance of its solutions in customers’ decision-making endow it with high customer retention and revenue visibility. Impressively, it deals with the 10 largest U.S. banks, top five credit card issuers, the biggest 25 auto lenders and thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies. Also, the company makes significant investments to modernize its infrastructure and facilitate the seamless transition to the latest Big Data and analytics technologies. This enables TransUnion to expand its business and improve cost structure.Moreover, as emerging market economies continue to develop and mature, the company is well-positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio-economic trends. Additionally, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and higher consumer awareness about the importance and usage of their credit information are propelling the demand for TransUnion’s consumer solutions.With continued growth impetus and core focus, investors’ confidence is likely to be boosted and the share price is anticipated to hit new 52-week milestones every now and then in 2018.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry include On Assignment, Inc.

1753,FLT,"Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) will be paying $60 million on account of lapses in compliance programs during 2004-2012 period. Earlier, the world’s leading money transfer company accrued $49 million toward resolution of this matterThis payment will be made by Western Union to New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to resolve violations of the state’s law arising out of the facts set forth in the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ).The DoJ stated that during 2004-2012, Western Union violated U.S. laws as it processed hundreds of thousands of transactions for agents and others engaged in an international consumer fraudulent scheme.As part of this scheme, fraudsters made contact with victims in the U.S. posing as family members in need or promised prizes or job prospects.

Particularly, technology investment, mobility, cloud computing, cyber security, eCommerce, digital marketing, big data and business intelligence contributed to the demand landscape for technology resources.The company rolled out its new customer relationship management system to a number of offices during the second quarter, which is expected to improve client services and enhance business operations going forward. Recently, the company set up a new $300 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate led by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The new credit facility will expire in May 2022, replacing the existing $170 million asset-based revolving credit facility. This facility is likely to prove conductive to the company’s revenues in the upcoming quarter.However, much like the commercial space, KForce’s Technology and Finance & Accounting operations are grappling with a challenging procurement environment. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Technology segment (which constitutes a major portion of KForce’s total revenues) in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be flat year over year, with the estimates pegged at $228 million for the quarter. Additionally, revenues from Finance & accounting segment are expected to be lower, with estimate pegged at $87 million, compared with reported revenues of $88 million in the prior quarter.This apart, softness in the labor market as well as increased competitive pressure adds to the company’s concerns.Although management continues to make selective investments in revenue-generating talent, productivity remained significantly below the peak levels, adding to its concerns. Further, Kforce has been facing significant declines in a few of its largest clients in the past few quarters due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Business disruption and internal organizational challenges faced by these clients impacted its overall revenues and are likely to remain headwinds in the impending quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Kforce this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +1.32% as the Most Accurate estimate of 46 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kforce carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.55% and a Zacks Rank #2.The Brink's Company (BCO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.FleetCor Technologies, Inc.

Navigant intends to use the cash proceeds of the sale to invest in digital, data and analytics solutions, mergers and acquisitions.The proceeds will also be allocated to return as much as $175 million (in capital) to shareholders through share repurchases in the next 12 months, initiate a dividend policy (whose terms will be decided at or post deal closure) and repay its credit facilities (until there is any extra need for capital).Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Navigant is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

1764,FLT,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 4. Last quarter, the Chinese e-commerce giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.21%.The surprise history has been decent in Alibaba’s case. The company surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average four-quarter positive surprise of 11.39%.Coming to price performance, on a 12-month basis, the company’s shares have rallied 53% compared with the industry’s gain of 44.6%.Strength in Alibaba’s Core E-Commerce BusinessThis segment comprises marketplaces operating in retail and wholesale commerce in China, and international commerce. Revenues in the last reported fiscal third quarter were RMB73.2 billion (US$11.3 billion), increasing 57% year over year. Revenues are expected to further increase, driven by innovation in data technology, widespread application of big data, and increasing validation for Taobao and Tmall portals.Strong Mobile Growth In the fiscal third quarter, Mobile Monthly Active Users (MAU) were 580 million, reflecting an increase of 18% from the prior-year quarter and 6% sequentially. The number is expected to expand further, driving revenues for the company. This is because of the increased adoption of mobile devices by consumers as the primary method of accessing Alibaba’s platforms. Additionally, over the past few quarters, Alibaba has been witnessing an increase in monetization rates. The company is building its online marketing inventory on both mobile and PC, and likely to continue witnessing higher monetization rates, thereby increasing profits of the company.Growing Cloud MomentumIn the last reported fiscal third quarter, revenues were RMB3.6 billion (US$553 million), increasing 104% year over year. Additionally, Alibaba Cloud launched 396 new products and features to enable small and large enterprises, for achieving higher computing performance and storage capability.The figure is expected to further increase in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by an increase in the number of paying customers and higher-than-usual spending by them, reflecting increased usage of services.Overhangs Remain Concerns remain in the form of rising expenses associated with new business initiatives, increasing logistics and order-fulfillment costs. Also, the company is willing to spend plenty of cash on its entertainment and media units, which management has identified as key growth drivers outside of its core e-commerce business.Also, increasing competition from companies like Amazon.com Inc.

1765,FLT,"With improving economic and labor market conditions, hiring services in the United States have gradually picked up pace. However, Robert Half International Inc (RHI  -  Free Report) is yet to reap significant gains from such conditions. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the both the top and bottom line depicts a probable year-over-year decline.The Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017, which has been stable in the last 30 days, is currently pegged at 69 cents, and is within management’s guidance of 66-72 cents per share. The consensus mark is down couple of cents from the year-ago quarter.Robert Half, which is slated to report on Oct 24, is expected to witness a decline in net revenues owing to sluggishness in its Protiviti segment and Global Staffing Division. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of net revenues for the third quarter is expected to decline 0.6% to reach $1,331 million from the year-ago period. The estimated figure, however, falls within the guided range of $1,305-1,365 million for the said quarter.  We note that the company’s revenues have lagged estimates in three out of the past four quarters. On a year-over year basis, revenues have declined in the trailing three quarters.Segment DetailsRevenues in the Protiviti Division are expected to decline 9.2% in the quarter under review. This segment has been lacking high-margin clients, leading to lower revenue opportunities. Although Robert Half has been trying to achieve a turnaround in this segment through acquisitions and business agreements, they are yet bear any considerable impact upon the company’s performance.The company’s Global Staffing Division has been struggling lately, owing to weakness in its domestic operations.However, net services revenues from the temporary and consulting staffing arena are expected to increase approximately 1%, per analysts polled by Zacks. Of late, there is an increase in demand for temporary and consulting professionals. Additionally, higher demand for temporary workers for the upcoming holiday season is expected to benefit revenues from this division. However, the upside may not be sufficient to offset the overall declines expected at Global Staffing and Protiviti segments.Robert Half International Inc.

1771,FLT,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings scheduled for May 3, 2018, should reflect revenue and earnings growth.The company has witnessed revenue growth for the past several quarters and the trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter, led by accretion from the merger with Heartland Payments, other alliances and joint ventures. Moreover, there is ever-increasing demand for electronic payment transactions, which provide the company abundant scope for top-line growth.Region-wise, the United States should show higher revenues led by its direct distribution business, partly offset by a decline in the wholesale business. Europe should benefit from favorable currency movements and synergies from the Erste joint venture. Penetration in the pan-European markets should lead to growth in the e-commerce and omni-solution business. Asia Pacific business should show strong revenues from Philippians, Singapore, Taiwan, and China led by Ezidebit and eWAY, payment solutions platform.We expect revenue accretion from the company’s acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, in third quarter of 2017. This acquisition is highly complementary to Global Payments’ gaming business and will expand its existing suite of innovative products and solutions.A reduction in tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%, down from approximately 26.5% in 2017, should aid margins.We expect the company to have used its cash to pay down debt, which will result in the reduction of leverage ratio, which was at 3.6 times at the end of Dec 31, 2017.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history.

1772,FLT,"Fitbit Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. Notably, Fitbit's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 43.3%.The company's shares have lost 6.9% in the past 12 months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 32%.  The company’s growth has been hampered by increasing competition in the fitness wearable category, lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Increasing Competition From Other PlayersFitbit, which became a prominent name for its simple fitness wearables, has been hurt by massive competition in the market. It faces competition in both the high and low-end product range. On the high-end front, it competes with Apple Watch. Although Fitbit expected Ionic to help the company take on Apple, it is hardly an easy task to compete with one of the biggest companies in the world. Also, many big manufacturers are developing connected devices on Google's Android operating system.On the lower end, fitness-tracking devices from Jawbone, Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Xiaomi also pose tough competition. Even the launch of its flasgship Ionic and addition of innovative features have not helped it stay ahead of its competitors.Fitbit’s Initiatives to Drive growthThe company has been introducing new products to increase its revenue base. Yet,these products are unable to drive enough revenues for the company.
