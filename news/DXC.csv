5,DXC,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

30,DXC,"Thoughts from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) management on how it plans to use growing cash on its balance sheet may overshadow earnings when it reports fiscal second-quarter results late Wednesday.It's the first earnings report since HPE spun off its enterprise services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC). HPE expects to close the sale of its struggling software business to U.K.-based Micro Focus later this year.""We believe that investors remain focused on how HPE can utilize their cash balance to make further transformative acquisitions to bolster growth and/or return excess capital to shareholders,"" said Katy Huberty, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report.HPE in April updated its financial outlook to reflect the spinoff. Analysts estimate profit of 35 cents vs. 42 cents in the year-earlier period, with revenue falling 24% to $9.64 billion.""HPE has missed consensus revenue estimates the last three quarters, most recently citing slower server demand and order cuts from a tier 1 service providers, rising component costs, and currency headwinds,"" added Huberty. ""And while currency headwinds should be more muted this quarter, we believe that continued server and storage weakness, rising memory costs and more muted spending expectations with HPE will drive continued top-line weakness.""HPE stock edged down 3 cents during early trading on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Amid its restructuring and uncertainty over how it'll use cash, HPE stock is trading at about the same price as six months ago.  Learn more about companies in the Computer-Tech Services group at IBD Stock Checkup.The Trump administration's proposal to lower taxes on overseas cash brought back to the U.S. could boost HPE as well as rival Cisco Systems (CSCO).

33,DXC,"Some of America's most venerable tech companies aim to renew growth by breaking up.The jury is still out on whether that will work for Conduent (CNDT), which has a long road ahead, analysts say. Separated from Xerox (XRX) in January, Conduent helps other companies get their financial house in order in the field known as business process outsourcing.Some analysts say Conduent aims to build a more competitive business. Others contend it could be a more attractive takeover target down the road. Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients. ""While this would have impact on top-line trajectory on a reported basis, it is a quick way to drive margin as well as restore balance-sheet powder for strategic investment. In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

41,DXC,"Last week, DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) announced the completion of the much awaited spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merging it with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The newly-formed company has been named as Perspecta Inc., which started trading on the New York Stock Exchange from Jun 1, 2018, under the ticker symbol “PRSP.”Notably, the three aforementioned companies came together in October last year to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital. The new company is anticipated to have a total workforce of more than 14,000 and generate annual revenues of approximately $4.3 billion.The whole deal was structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, thereby making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders. Upon completion of this transaction, DXC stockholders received 1 share of Perspecta for every 2 shares of DXC held in the company as of record date May 25.Along with this, DXC received $984 million of cash from Perspecta. Earlier the company had announced that the net proceeds from the transaction will be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.Per the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC’s latest spin-merger move is believed to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients.Notably, the company is a result of the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The transaction has enhanced shareholders’ value of both companies. Additionally, it has opened up new opportunities for driving the company’s growth.Nonetheless, the company’s escalating interest expenses resulting from increased debt burden make us increasingly cautious about its near-term performance, as this might dampen its profitability. DXC’s long-term outstanding debt significantly increased last fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden.DXC currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. DXC has lost 12.1% of its value in the said period, while the industry has gained 10.1%.A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are On Assignment, Inc.

43,DXC,"The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for interest rates, hit 3% for the first time in about four years. The Federal Reserve, in fact, has already stepped up the pace of monetary tightening from two to three additional rate hikes this year.Rising inflation expectations led to Treasuries getting sold off. After all, higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. The 10-year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure.Investors have exited bond proxies, including utilities and consumer staples. Meanwhile, financials, technology and home improvement suppliers are expected to benefit from a resurgent benchmark bond yield.Benchmark Bond Yield Reaches Key MilestoneThe 10-year government bond yield increased 0.9 basis points (bps) to 2.983% on Apr 24, after touching a four-year intraday high of 3.001%, according to Tradeweb data. The benchmark bond yield had exceeded the 3% mark briefly in 2013 and January 2014, which was toward the end of the bond market wipeout, better known as the “taper tantrum.”In fact, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, Ian Lyngen expects the bond yield to hover near 3.047% in the near term, which would see the yield go past the highs seen in January 2014, propelling it to its loftiest levels since 2011.The 10-year is used as a proxy for many other important financial matters, such as mortgage rates. Fed officials, for now, have rekindled the idea to raise federal funds rate four times this year and not three times as previously indicated. In March, the Fed has already raised rates a quarter point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. On Apr 20, the Fed-fund futures market witnessed a 40.2% chance of four rate hikes this year, much higher than 28.6% estimated in the previous month.What’s Acting in Favor of Bond Yields?Rising inflationary pressures and speculations that the Fed will take aggressive steps in hiking rates have kept the yield at elevated levels for now.Consumer prices are expected to scale north mostly due to a rally in oil and raw material prices. Oil prices rose to the highest level on Apr 24 since Nov 24, lifted by hearsay that U.S. sanction on Iran will be put into place by May.American companies, by the way, are paying a significant amount for purchasing raw materials. As per HIS Markit, the cost of raw materials and partly finished goods increased at the fastest pace in nearly five years. Trump’s recent move to impose tariffs on steel and a series of Chinese goods were partly to blame.Equities Wobble, Defensive Stocks Take a HitHigher bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks as it increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities. And why not? While the benchmark yield has touched the coveted 3% mark, the average dividend yield for stocks trading on the Dow is 2.4% and the average dividend yield for the S&P 500 components is just 2%.Defensive sectors known as “bond proxies”, especially, have fallen out of favor. The industries including utilities, consumer staples, telecom and real-estate are known for providing higher dividend yields, but, with Treasury yields climbing such stocks have lost their charm. Moreover, bonds are providing encouraging yields without the higher risk that comes with equities.In a sign of how money is being pulled out of such sectors, the Utilities SPDR ETF has seen outflows of $739.8 million in the past month and nearly 833 million has been redeemed from the Staples SPDR ETF so far this year.Which Sectors Gain From the Rise?Shares of banks and insurance companies were bolstered by higher interest rates in the form of an uptick in bond yields. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Rising rates also act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more, expanding their profit margins.Rate hikes, in the meantime, indicated that the economy is in fine fettle. After all, the jobless rate is at a 17-year low, wages are improving and consumer confidence continues to hover at record high levels. All these lead to higher levels of spending, which spells good times for consumer discretionary companies like automakers, casinos, homebuilders, apparel retailers and cruise lines.Technology firms also stand to gain from a rate hike. Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day. And a stronger economy could easily boost their bottom lines. Rising rates may also compel would-be home buyers to stop searching for houses and instead improve their existing ones.5 Winning StocksWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors poised to gain from the current interest rate scenario.

49,DXC,"By their very nature, growth investors are primarily focused on finding companies whose earnings and revenue are expected grow at a rate that outpaces the market. This investment strategy comes with its fair share of risks, but it also brings the exciting possibility of outsized returns—an end goal that every investor desires.Over the past several years, Wall Street’s most exciting growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector. From industry innovators like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to exciting foreign stocks such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), tech-focused growth investors have been rewarded with massive profits recently.Strong earnings and impressive sales imply that the technology sector’s hot streak could continue throughout 2018—despite recent market-wide volatility. That means that growth investors searching for the next great market-beating stock might want to keep their focus on tech companies.Luckily, we can pair the proven Zacks Rank with our innovative Style Scores system, which includes a “Growth” category, to find strong growth tech stocks.

50,DXC,"Mirroring a banner 2017, this year is likely to be a great one for mega tech stocks. Big tech companies are hitting record-highs of late, with shares outpacing the S&P 500 since its nadir on Feb 8.President Trump has delivered historic relief to tech majors by lowering tax rates. This in turn is boosting profit margins. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT), which connects various devices to the cloud, is expected to be a huge growth driver for tech majors. Given the bullishness, sound large-cap tech stocks continue to be popular among sell-side analysts.  How Did Tech Bigwigs Fare?Tech heavyweights continue to influence the U.S. stock market,  for good reason. Investing in large-cap tech stocks turned out to be a winning strategy, especially during the recent bout of gyration that sent the stock market into correction.In fact, the much-loved tech sector rallied 9% year to date, while the broader S&P 500 went up just 3.4%. Mega-sized tech names like the FAANG stocks — Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — contributed the lion’s share and recently hit intraday record highs.Amazon, in particular, jumped more than 30% since the start of the year and contributed almost fifth of the gains in the S&P 500, per Silverblatt.Sell-Side Analysts Back Big TechsSolid performance by tech bigwigs compelled sell-side analysts to root for them. These stocks are recording rapid earnings and revenue growth that forced brokerage firms to take note.Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to investors “net buy ratings of major tech players remain extremely high relative to history.”Giant Tech Stocks to Make Billions Under Tax PlanThe Republican tax overhaul policy is providing the much-needed windfall to large tech companies. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. This extra cash is helping the companies pursue a combination of share buybacks, dividend payouts and M&A activities.Let us not forget, tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying hefty corporate taxes on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under the latest tax reduction plan.The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest. Tech Companies to Get BiggerNotable Internet companies like Amazon and Facebook are expected to grow at a fast pace on a significant rise in revenues in the near term. They are expected to take advantage of the large number of advertisements and e-commerce that will still move online.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the IoT, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launch of complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling.5 Tech Behemoths to BuyBanking on the aforesaid positives, tech majors are poised to see higher earnings.

52,DXC,"Synopsys, Inc.

In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 10%.The question lingering on investors’ mind is whether this vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise this time.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.We believe the company’s continued focus on introducing products, acquisitions and deal wins will continue to aid financials. The global support provided by the company and its unique intellectual properties are expected to boost results as well.The company’s inorganic additions are accretive to its portfolio. Apart from enhancing the product suite, these acquisitions strengthen its market reach and drive top-line growth.Synopsys’ recent additions include PhoeniX Software, Silicon and Beyond, Kilopass Technology and Black Duck Software, which are anticipated to boost the company’s revenue generation going ahead.Additionally, the company’s time-based license revenue model, which offers better visibility and predictability, is a positive for the company. It ensures effective renting of the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee.However, dampened margins pertaining to increased costs and expenses remain a headwind for near-term profitability. Furthermore, competition from peers and uncertainty surrounding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us cautious.Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Synopsys, Inc.

53,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this IT services company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017. So, this will be the fourth quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that DXC Technology is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.06%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.20, which indicates a massive 91.3% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged, over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.12 billion, up approximately 224% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteSynergies from the merger of CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business will likely have contributed to the company’s top and bottom-line results. Apart from this, strategic partnerships and acquisitions are anticipated to have brought in additional revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. However, escalating interest expenses resulting from increased debt burden might have dampened the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Merger Synergies — The Key Growth CatalystThe above-mentioned merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom. Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the combined entity will have generated revenues of  more than $24 billion in fiscal 2018. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first fiscal and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company registered more than 200% surge in revenues in all the preceding three quarters, mainly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance as well.Additional Revenues From AcquisitionsFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced six acquisitions — Tribridge, Logicalis SMC, Racemi, M-Power, eBECS and Stable37.Therefore, the buyout is likely to benefit the company’s soon-to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead, the company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid the fiscal fourth-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched DXC Managed Cloud Services, supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP, as well. These alliances have increased its access to new technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Also, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Escalating Interest Costs to Impede ProfitabilityRising interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability. As of Dec 31, 2017, DXC Technology has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.37 billion, while it had paid $231 million as interest expenses during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, which was 166% higher than the previous fiscal-period tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt significantly increased last fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

54,DXC,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.9%.The company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.2%. QuickBooks Online ecosystem and TurboTax are likely to aid the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line performance. However, high costs and expenses remain a major concern.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Intuit is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intuit carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.24%.Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.84 billion, up 11.9% year over year and earnings are projected at $4.67 per share, up 19.7% on year over year basis.Factors at PlayThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income tax preparation products and services. Notably, the company has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the last several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its enriched product portfolio, Intuit will have capitalized on this opportunity which we believe will be well reflected in third-quarter results.For the fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base to be in the range of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal third quarter with a subscriber base of 3.144 million, marking year-over-year improvement of 41.6%.The year-over-year increase in the online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.Going ahead, we expect the company’s Consumer Tax segment revenues to continue to benefit from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.The company’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The analysts covering the stock expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, consequently bolstering the overall top-line performance. Furthermore, the company’s TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion its bottom-line results.Nonetheless, Intuit’s high costs and expenses remain a major concern. During the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call, the company had hinted that it would increase investments in engineering and marketing to seize the growing opportunity globally. Notably, Intuit’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 10 basis points year over year. This makes us slightly cautious about the to-be-reported quarter’s bottom-line results.Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intuit Inc.

55,DXC,"Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 17.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a negative earnings surprise of 33.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayVoxeljet’s first-quarter 2018 results are likely to benefit from its cost-saving initiatives. Also, the company’s large scale service centers globally, including the opened subsidiaries in China and India, are expected to bolster growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Voxeljet experienced improvement in revenues from its American and Chinese service centers. This upside was driven by increased market penetration in the respective regions and growing customer base.Revenues from the company’s Services segment also showed signs of improvement in fourth-quarter 2017. Evidently, the metric increased 26.5% to €2.9 million from €2.3 million in the year-ago period. Voxeljet’s gross profit and gross profit margin too increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We believe that improved operational execution is likely to drive the company’s bottom-line performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, Voxeljet’s solid investment in core R&D to maintain its position as a technology leader in 3D printing bodes well for upcoming quarters.However, over the past couple of years, the 3D printing industry has been suffering from a prolonged decline in demand for 3D printers. Revenues from the company’s System segment (including sales of 3D printers) declined 20% to €3.1 million in fourth-quarter 2017 from €3.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The waning demand for printers has added to the company’s concerns, which might reflect poorly on the coming quarterly results.Furthermore, Voxeljet has been suffering from a decline in total backlog of 3D printer orders over the past few quarters. For instance, the company’s total backlogs dropped 26.8% in fourth-quarter 2017 compared with its level at the end of 2016. Other headwinds, including inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries have also marred the performance of several companies in the industry. We expect Voxeljet’s first-quarter 2018 results to be adversely affected by these factors.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Voxeljet this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Voxeljet has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 12 cents.

57,DXC,"By their very nature, growth investors are primarily focused on finding companies whose earnings and revenue are expected grow at a rate that outpaces the market. This investment strategy comes with its fair share of risks, but it also brings the exciting possibility of outsized returns—an end goal that every investor desires.Over the past several years, Wall Street’s most exciting growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector. From industry innovators like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to exciting foreign stocks such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), tech-focused growth investors have been rewarded with massive profits recently.Strong earnings and impressive sales imply that the technology sector’s hot streak could continue throughout 2018—despite recent market-wide volatility. That means that growth investors searching for the next great market-beating stock might want to keep their focus on tech companies.Luckily, we can pair the proven Zacks Rank with our innovative Style Scores system, which includes a “Growth” category, to find strong growth tech stocks. Investors should note that our Growth category values earnings and sales growth, as well as improvements to a company’s financial statements—including strong cash flows and great return on equity.With all of this said, check out these three tech stocks for growth investors to consider now:1. AppFolio, Inc. (APPF  -  Free Report)AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for the property management and legal industries. The company’s AppFolio Property Manager is a leading solution for property management, while its MyCase application is ideal for practitioners and small law firms. Currently, the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AppFolio recently surged into profitability, which is something that investors tend to reward. This fiscal year, current estimates are calling for earnings growth of 66% and net sales growth of 27%. The company is also improving its cash position, generating quadruple-digit cash flow growth and operating with a net margin of nearly 9%.The firm has also proven to be an efficient one, with Return on Equity of 16% crushing its industry average. AppFolio should be able to use this, and its solid margins, to capitalize on its new business opportunities. APPF has also displayed the strength of small caps recently, adding about 32% over the past two months. 2. Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report)Twitter operates one of the world’s most popular social media websites, but thanks to a number of new initiatives—including a shift to live, original content and a renewed focus on profitability—the stock is now popping up on our growth screens.

The company is also witnessing cash flow growth of more than 95% currently.Meanwhile, Twitter has a number of new partnerships—with many notable media companies and sports organizations—that it should be able to leverage in an internet industry that has increasingly rewarded original content. 3. eGain Corporation (EGAN  -  Free Report)eGain provides web customer interaction, social customer interaction, and contact center applications. It is a growing name within the expanding customer engagement cloud solutions space. EGAN is holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and looks like another top growth pick right now.Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, eGain appears to be on track to report earnings growth of 127% for its full fiscal year, which ends in June.

58,DXC,"SAP SE’s (SAP  -  Free Report) board has recommendeda dividend of €1.40 per share for 2017, which represents a 12% year-over-year hike. Based on the weighted average 1,197 million shares outstanding, this will amount to a total dividend outlay of approximately €1.67 billion, representing a pay-out ratio of 41% (assuming the shareholders approve the Board’s recommendation).The dividend for 2017 is scheduled to be paid on or after May 22, 2018.Additionally, SAP decided to pay 40% or more of after-tax profit as dividends from now on, which is higher than the earlier ratio of more than 35%.The company’s operating cash flow improved 9% in 2017, growing for the third consecutive year.With long-term value creation in mind, the company has undertaken consistent measures to enhance balance sheet strength. With a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital-deployment activities.SAP’s debt/equity ratio of 0.20 compares unfavorably with the industry’s average of 0.08, which indicates a higher debt burden relative to the industry. However, the company displayed strong, consistent cash generation capabilities in recent years. Also, the company’s ROE of 17.6% is much higher than the industry average of 9.6%. This indicates that the company is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared with peers.Encouragingly, the company has a robust earnings surprise history, having posted an average surprise of 5.6% in the trailing four quarters and beating estimates all through. The company’s earnings surged 21% year over year in the recent quarterly results, riding on growth in the cloud subscriptions as well as software license order entry.SAP’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth drivers. The company’s S/4HANA proved to be a solid profit yielder, fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support revenues in recent times.In January 2018, the company announced that it has inked an agreement to buy cloud-based human resources-software company — Callidus Software, Inc.  — for $2.4 billion. The buyout will give SAP access to new sales analytic and customer engagement tools.However, there are some risks associated with investing in the stock. Dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters along with flat customer spending projections have affected the company’s performance. Over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns, which affected consumers’ purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of the company’s key markets are also hurting financial performance.SAP’s shares have lost 2.2% in the last six months, against the 18.3% rally of its industry. SAP carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) as we believe its short-term risks outweigh its strengths.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include GTT Communications, Inc. (GTT  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.GTT Communications has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beat estimates thrice for an average of 101.1%.DXC Technology generated four strong beats during the same time frame, for an average positive surprise of 23.9%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

64,DXC,"Have you been paying attention to shares of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.1% over the past month. DXC hit a new 52-week high of $107.13 in the previous session. DXC Technology has gained 12.46% since the start of the year compared to the 9.16% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 8.54% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 8, 2018, DXC Technology reported EPS of $2.15 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.69%.For the current fiscal year, DXC Technology is expected to post earnings of $7.83 per share on $24.38 billion in revenues. This represents a 153.55% change in EPS on a 220.46% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.03 per share on $24.25 billion in revenues. This represents changes of 14.89% and -0.53%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile DXC has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.DXC Technology has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 13.63x current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 13.43x versus its peer group's average of 17.05x. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.3. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.DXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus  DXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus | DXC Technology Company. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, DXC Technology  currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if DXC Technology meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though DXC shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.

66,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of GBP 250 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.750% Senior Notes which are due 2025. The notes are being issued at a discount and are priced at 99.528% of the aggregate principal amount.The offering is anticipated to close on or about March 15. Led by Lloyds Bank plc and Merrill Lynch International, a group of underwriters will be conducting the offering.DXC is looking to use the proceeds from the offerings post the payment of all related expenses for repaying a part of its GBP 287 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans under revolving credit facility. The company may also use the fund for general corporate purposes and working capital.Though the Fed has been raising interest rates for the past year, borrowing costs are still very low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. Furthermore, we believe the company has been offering senior notes at the right time as the Fed is likely to raise interest rates much faster than previously anticipated.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. Notably, the company exited the third-quarter of fiscal 2018 with $2.926 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.671 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt balance (net of current maturities) was $6.367 billion.The company’s share price movement has been quite favorable since its formation via the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) which concluded on Apr 1, 2017. The company’s shares have returned 50.7%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 31.9%.Currently, DXC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks worth considering the broader technology sector are Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Facebook, Inc.

67,DXC,"Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) CEO Jeff Bezos topped the recently announced Forbes 2018 Billionaires list for the first time. Per Forbes, Bezos is worth $112 billion, up $39.2 billion from 2017, the biggest one-year gain in the list’s history.Amazon’s strong share price movement driven by impressive performance has been a key catalyst behind the massive rise in Bezos’ wealth. Amazon carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has returned 81.6% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 66.5%.Growth Prospects RobustAmazon is primarily benefiting from sustained momentum in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its ubiquitous presence in retail. AWS generates much higher margins than retail, positively impacting Amazon’s profitability.  Moreover, the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. Moreover, the Whole Foods acquisition has helped the company rapidly penetrate the grocery segment of the brick-and-mortar stores. Further, increasing number of paid Prime members is positive.Additionally, we believe that Amazon’s strategy of diversifying footprint into healthcare and financial services bodes well for its CEO and shareholders in the long haul.Better Choices ExistAlthough entrepreneurship is the best possible way to become a centibillionaire like Jeff Bezos, it is not everyone’s forte.

71,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, both marked a robust improvement mainly driven by the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).Notably, in 2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a spin-off-merger agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation, wherein it agreed to spin-off its Enterprise Services division and merge the same with the latter’s businesses. The transaction closed on Apr 1, 2017, and the new entity was named DXC Technology.Coming back to the fiscal third-quarter results, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 and also increased on a year-over-year basis.DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteQuarter DetailsRevenues in the quarter soared a whopping 222.7% from the year-ago period to $6.186 billion. However, excluding the impact of purchase price accounting and last year’s one-time contract reset United States Public Sector (USPS), revenues were down 4%. On a constant-currency basis, revenues fell 5.9% year over year. DXC Technology’s revenues also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.228 billion.Segment wise, revenues from Global Business Services (GBS) surged a massive 121.3% on a year-over-year basis to $2.315 billion. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, on constant currency basis, revenues decreased 6.6% year over year. The decline was primarily due to weak performance of traditional application services which was partially offset by growth at Enterprise Applications and Business Process Services businesses. Revenues from the new business for GBS came in at $3.3 billion during the reported quarter.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the fiscal third quarter came in at $3.145 billion as compared with $871 million reported in the year-ago quarter. On constant currency basis, revenues dropped 6.8% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting), primarily due to decline in traditional infrastructure services. Revenues from new business for GIS awards came in at $2.2 billion during the quarter.USPS revenues came in at $726 million during the quarter, however were down 11.9% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting). Revenues from new business for USPS awards came in at $527 million in the quarter.The company’s adjusted operating income from continuing operations (excluding one-time items) amounted to $927 million as compared with $626 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 came in at $1.870 billion. During this period, the company returned $189 million to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments.Updated Fiscal 2018 OutlookThe company reaffirmed fiscal 2018 revenues guidance but increased its outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share. For fiscal 2018, DXC Technology projects its revenues in the range of $24-$24.5 billion in constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $24.32 billion.However, the non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range has been raised to $7.50-$8.00 from $7.25-$7.75 anticipated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $7.52 per share.Bottom LineThe company’s upbeat guidance for earnings makes us optimistic about its near-term performance.Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. This alliance has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology might be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which is likely to drive growth over the long run.

72,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.99, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 145.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised upward over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.23 billion, up a massive 224.9% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology’s fiscal third-quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteLet’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Combined Entities Opened Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company had registered a 229% surge in the fiscal second-quarter revenues chiefly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal third-quarter top-line performance as well.Enhancing Customer Base with PartnershipsThe company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid fiscal third-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP as well. These alliances have increased the company’s access to advanced technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Furthermore, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Buyouts to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions — Tribridge and Logicalis SMC. While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July last year, the Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process.Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology. Therefore, this buyout is likely to benefit the company’s to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Rising Interest Costs to Dent ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability. As of Sep 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.33 billion, while it paid $154 million as interest expenses during the first half of fiscal 2018, which was 185% higher than the first half of fiscal 2017 tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt has significantly increased this fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

74,DXC,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 IFRS earnings per share of €1.55 ($1.83), reflecting a surge of 21% on a year-over-year basis. This improvement is primarily attributable to growth in the cloud subscriptions as well as software license order entry. The bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59.For the full year, IFRS earnings came in at €3.36 per share, up 10% over the past year, driven by the robust operating performance, and meaningful contribution from Sapphire Ventures.Total IFRS revenues for the quarter were €6,805 million ($8,014.9 million), up 1.2%year over year. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,985 million. A flourishing cloud business, along with strong growth of support revenues, aided top-line growth during the quarter.Also, new cloud bookings — a key indicator of sales success in cloud business — were up an impressive 22% to €591 million ($696.1 million) in the reported quarter.Full-year revenues came in at €23,461 million, reflecting growth of 6.3% year over year.Inside the HeadlinesCloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions & Support and Software licenses & support, reported fourth-quarter revenues of €5,807 million ($6,839.5 million), up 1% year over year.Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €995 million ($1,171.9 million) in the quarter, up 20% year over year. On the other hand, Software licenses & support reported revenues of €4,813 million ($5,668.8 million), down 2% on a year-over-year basis.Also, for fourth-quarter 2017, Services revenues went up 4% year over year to €998 million ($1,175.4 million).The EMEA region observed phenomenal growth in Cloud subscriptions and support revenues, particularly in Germany and Russia. SAP also witnessed double-digit software revenue growth in Russia, Switzerland and the Netherlands.For the APJ region, SAP witnessed a strong performance in both cloud and software revenue plus cloud subscriptions, led by robust performances in Japan and China. However, the Americas region faced significant currency headwinds.The company reported IFRS operating margin of 28.9%, almost flat from the figure recorded in fourth-quarter 2016. Also, the company recorded a 1% upswing in operating profit, which came in at €1,964 million ($2,313.2 million).SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteQuarter in DetailSAP’s human capital management (‘‘HCM’’) applications continue to act as a key growth driver, with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 2,300-customer base at the end of the year. In addition, SAP’s Customer Engagement and Commerce (CEC) solutions once again achieved impressive double-digit growth in new cloud. During the quarter, SAP concluded the acquisition of Gigya, an established player in customer identity and access management. The buyout will boost SAP’s CEC solutions.Additionally, continued strong market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be a sturdy profit churner. During the reported quarter, the company gained 1,000 additional customers, with more than 40% being new. This uptrend hugely propelled the company’s revenues. With little competition in its core market, this software and service provider experienced strong results in the quarter in the aforesaid segment.This apart, SAP’s business networks (which it manages through three main players, namely Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) burgeoned 18% during the reported quarter. Currently, the Ariba network handles trading worth more than $1 trillion of 3.1 million connected companies, which boosted the company’s quarterly revenues. While Concur manages travel and expenses of more than 50 million end users, Fieldglass helps users manage 4.3 million contingent workers.Other Financial DetailsFor the year ended Dec 31, 2017, the company’s operating cash flow came in at €5.05 billion ($4.8 billion), up 9% on a year-over-year basis, while free cash flow rose 4% year over year to €3.77 billion ($3.8 billion). The company bought back shares worth €500 million in the year and paid a dividend of €1.5 billion.AcquisitionThe company also announced that it had inked an agreement to buy cloud-based human resources-software company — Callidus Software, Inc.  — for $2.4 billion. The terms of the deal represent a purchase price of $36 per share, which reflects a premium of about 10% to Callidus's closing price of $32.70 on Monday. The buyout will give SAP access to new sales analytic and customer engagement tools.SAP expects the deal to be neutral to its non-IFRS earnings for 2018 and accretive to 2019 non-IFRS earnings. SAP plans to fund the deal with existing cash balances and an acquisition term loan. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.This is SAP’s first sizeable acquisition in about three and a half years. The company played relatively cool in the acquisition space after buying Ariba Inc., Concur Technologies Inc. and SuccessFactors Inc., for an aggregate $15 billion between 2012 and 2014.GuidanceFueled by continued strong momentum of the cloud business, SAP released optimistic view for full-year 2018. The company expects non-IFRS total revenue to come within a range of €24.6-€25.1 billion at constant currency (cc), which represents a growth of 5-7% year over year.The company expects the non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenues to lie in the €5.8-€5.0-billion range at constant currencies. Also, non-IFRS cloud and software revenue outlook is expected to grow in the band of 6-8% to €20.7-€21.1 billion. Additionally, non-IFRS operating profit forecast for 2018 is estimated to be in the band of €7.3-€7.5 billion reflecting year-over-year growth of 8-11%.Our TakeSAP’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth drivers. The company’s S/4HANA has proved to be a solid profit yielder, fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support revenue in recent times.Also, SAP’s latest class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications — SAP HANA — has been the biggest top-line driver ever since its introduction. The company’s recent offering from the SAP HANA family, S/4HANA, has established itself as a mission critical control center for businesses pursuing digital transformation. This apart, the company constantly upgrades the existing products and launches fresh ones to expand its customer base, thereby offering a competitive edge over peers.However, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections, have affected the company’s performances. Also, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns, which have adversely affected consumers’ purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of the company’s key markets are also hurting its financial performance.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSAP presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include GTT Communications, Inc.

75,DXC,"Last week, DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) announced the spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merging the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital.Initially, the new company will have a total workforce of over 14,000 and generate annual revenues of approximately $4.3 billion. However, the firm’s name has not been decided yet. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of March 2018.Transaction DetailsPer the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, thereby making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon the completion of its spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.On the other hand, Veritas Capital will receive approximately 14% shareholding and a cash consideration of $400 million upon completion of the entire transaction.The current president and CEO of Vencore — Mac Curtis — will hold the position of chief executive officer of the new company, while Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, DXC USPS, will serve as the chief operating officer. Mike Lawrie chairman, president and CEO of DXC, will chair the board of the new company, while names for other positions will be decided later.Rationale Behind the TransactionPer the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC Technology’s latest spin-merger move is believed to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients. Upon the successful formation, the new company will become one of the top five IT services providers to the U.S. government.Furthermore, it should be noted that Vencore is well known for providing cyber security, engineering, analytics and other IT solutions to the federal government, while KeyPoint is specialized in offering investigative services to a wide range of sectors, including federal, defense, intelligence and civilian sectors.Hence, per the company, the above-mentioned transaction is likely to fortify its capabilities in “offering differentiated, mission-driven solutions in cybersecurity, big data analytics, cloud engineering, enterprise IT services, and systems engineering – all enabled by a portfolio of cutting-edge Intellectual Property (IP).”The reinforced capabilities will help the new company win government contracts, in turn bringing in more revenues, in our opinion.Boosting Shareholders’ WealthThe latest move came just months after DXC Technology came into existence in April this year. Notably, the company is a result of the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The transaction has enhanced shareholders’ value of both the companies. Additionally, it has opened up new opportunities for driving the company’s growth.Therefore, we believe the recent spin-merger transaction of USPS business will not only boost DXC Technology’s shareholders’ value in the near term, but will also continue to create wealth over the long run.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 34%, significantly outperforming the industry, to which it belongs to, return of 21.1%.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Nutanix Inc.

76,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced entering into an agreement with Logicalis Group to buy the latter’s service management consultancy operation — Logicalis SMC. However, financial terms of the deal remain disclosed.The Netherlands-based Logicalis SMC was founded in 1998. This company is one of the leading providers of technology-enabled solutions for the service management sector in the Netherlands and the U.K.Moreover, Logicalis SMC is one of the biggest integrator of ServiceNow Inc.’s (NOW  -  Free Report) software and solutions, which mainly attracted DXC Technology to make such a move. It should be noted that Logicalis SMC was the first European company which became ServiceNow’s Master Solutions partner around 15 years ago.DXC Technology intends to integrate the to-be-acquired business with its Fruition Partners business which is the company’s leading global ServiceNow platform provider.The integration of Logicalis SMC business will further fortify DXC Technology’s position as a leading global software integrator for ServiceNow. The acquisition will help the company expand its presence across Europe. Also, it will strengthen its “scale, reach, industry experience and skills portfolio in the fast-growing enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.”Apart from this, DXC Technology will also benefit from Logicalis SMC’s strategic partnerships with companies like Cisco, International Business Machines and NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report).DXC Technology came into existence from the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The buyout of Logicalis SMC will mark DXC Technology’s second acquisition post its formation.This July, the company acquired privately-held Tribridge. Founded in 1998, Tribridge caters software services and cloud solutions needs of mid-market and enterprise customers in the areas of finance and operations, customer engagement, and human capital management.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 26.3%, significantly outperforming the industry, to which it belongs to, return of 19.7%.We believe the recent buyouts will further solidify DXC Technology’s position as one of the leading IT services provider in the world.Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc. We believe the merger has opened up a number of growth opportunities for the combined company. Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which will likely drive growth over the long run.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive, with companies like CACI International Inc. and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain other headwinds.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

77,DXC,"According to Bloomberg report, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is planning to slash 5,000 jobs in a desperate bid to contain costs and take restructuring efforts to the next level. This is almost 10% of the total staff employed by the company.These retrenchment actions are being taken by management to save costs, as HPE faces intense competitionfrom cloud providers such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report).CEO Meg Whitman has been reorganizing operations to boost profits and this layoff is a part of that strategy adopted by her earlier this month to reach $1.5 billion in savings. Reportedly, the layoffs will “target workers in the U.S. and around the world. Managers are also said to be included in these layoffs.“Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC  -  Free Report).).Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in August this year.Price performanceShares of HPE gained more than 3% during yesterdays’ trading session.Notably, although the entire industry, to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has declined 38.4% of its value, wider than the industry’s loss of 17.8%.Bottom LineWe believe HPE management’s decision of executive lay-off is a bold one, going a step ahead of what it has done earlier. Such a notable job cut will clearly save money for the company, which, consequently, can be reinvested to further boost growth of its cloud-based and cybersecurity business.However, we remain doubtful about the extent to which this decision will be an optimally cost-efficient one, at least in the near term, as it will take some time to effectively take up the burden of work from the existing ones.Currently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks With Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

78,DXC,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently debuted the Digital Hub in Singapore, intended for co-creating innovations with clients by bringing together digital technologies with top business ideas. The move is part of the company’s efforts to bolster digital marketing capabilities.The Digital Hub combines Accenture Interactive, analytics and mobility platform, part of the company's digital marketing-services arm, Accenture Digital, with enterprise-relevant digital technologies. The Accenture Digital Hub includes technology development, design and usability services to solve mission critical business problems, while enhancing customer experiences, consequently helping them to attain their goals.According to the company, “We’ve designed the Accenture Digital Hub in Singapore to serve as a catalyst for clients who want to co-create leading-edge customer experiences with us.”The latest move is anticipated to further boost Accenture’s ability to help clients design and create physical products. The launch of the  Digital Hub in Singapore will not only bring in a huge talent pool of professional, but will also expand reach in the region and commitment to Singapore clients.With this launch, the company will be able to help clients in creating, managing, integrating and analyzing value-focused solutions, thereby reducing cost and giving clients heightened responsiveness to change.Bottom LineAccenture stock has gained 15.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.6% growth of the industry it belongs to.The company’s long-term prospects look promising owing to sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. Moreover, we believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the revenue stream.Additionally, the company is focusing on building partnerships which is helping it foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio. Most recently, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Accenture joined forces to create a mixed team of designers, programmers, and other Apple experts, within Accenture Digital Studios units in select locations globally.Meanwhile, Accenture’s recent announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent bottom-line results. Increasing competition from the likes of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter the company’s growth to some extent.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

79,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report), formed through the merger of Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) recently expanded its ties with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) at VMworld 2017.The two entities are coming together to debut the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next generation hybrid cloud platform. This contract will enable DXC’s clients to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on the Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver enhanced performance for networking customers. Furthermore, it will offer users an integrated hybrid cloud solution, functioning much like a software-defined data center (SDDC). However, financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Per DXC, by this conglomerate ""we provide our clients the choice of both on-premises and cloud solutions on existing virtualized applications. DXC's Hybrid Cloud Service is a true accelerator for enterprises wanting to modernize and optimize existing infrastructures in a flexible consumption model, while embracing the open services of the public cloud.""The move comes at a time when DXC is strengthening its position in the virtualization server market. The company is expanding its expertise from just IT services to now include networking as well. We believe that the partnership will enable DXC to offer an efficient and improved hybrid IT environment to drive performance.The VMware Cloud on AWS will ward off difficulties while setting up a mature virtualized cloud-based infrastructure. This in turn will help DXC to expand existing networking-based infrastructure with the benefits of the VMware’s hybrid cloud offerings.VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space. With such partnership, DXC is poised well to benefit from the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions. Per a Gartner report, global spending on cloud technology is expected to increase 25% annually over the next few years, which will result in higher demand for virtualization capabilities. Bottom LineDXC Technology has outperformed the industry since it started trading on the NYSE on Mar 31, 2017. The stock has returned 22.9%, while the industry gained 12.1%.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc.

80,DXC,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Alexandria-based Phase One Consulting, a cloud computing and digital services provider. Notably, the two companies entered into the deal in June this year. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Founded in 1997, Phase One offers Salesforce-based IT services and software solutions, mainly focused on the federal market. Its services and solutions help federal agencies in modernizing and digitizing.The company was owned by private equity firm – RLJ Equity Partners – which had acquired it in January 2015. Its stronghold in the federal market attracted investments from the venture capital arm of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report), Salesforce Ventures in September last year.Post completion of this acquisition, Accenture intends to integrate under its Accenture Federal Services subsidiary. We believe that the recent acquisition will not only strengthen the company’s Salesforce capabilities, but will also help it in gaining more and more federal contracts, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Salesforce Capabilities Expansion ImpressiveSince 2014, Accenture has been aggressively trying to fortify its position as a leading provider of Salesforce capabilities. The recent buyout is the company’s seventh acquisition in the Salesforce space, while this is the first federal market acquisition related to Salesforce.Notably, Accenture is already a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with currently over 11,000 skilled consultants. Moreover, given that Salesforce is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it is imperative that Accenture enhances its capabilities in delivering the former’s services.Industry Forecasts Justify StrategyThe company’s strategy of boosting its cloud capabilities through such acquisitions is a step in the right direction, as evident from the latest forecast provided by several independent research firms. According to Gartner, the SaaS and cloud-based business application markets are likely to grow from $38.6 billion in 2016 to $46.3 billion in 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth rate of approximately 20%. Also, the research firm forecasts that the market will double by 2020 from the 2016 level.Another research firm – International Data Corporation (IDC) – predicts that the cloud software market will witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% during the 2014–2019 period, reaching $112.8 billion by 2019 end.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the increasing need for cloud-based applications and software, we anticipate Accenture’s investments in this space to propel long-term growth.Bottom LineWe are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Nonetheless, Accenture’s announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. Furthermore, increasing competition from other players like DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Per the company, “DXC Eclipse is a leading global Microsoft Gold Partner delivering Microsoft Dynamics 365, ERP, CRM, business process, analytics, and collaboration solutions on premise and in the cloud.”Our TakeThe company reported mixed first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, where in the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line missed the same. The company also provided a modest guidance for fiscal 2018.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).

83,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the first quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe merger has opened up new avenues of growth and will help the combined entity to become a leading player in the IT services domain. However, we believe that the benefits of the merger will come over the long run, as DXC Technology’s fiscal first-quarter results are likely to bear the impact of the integration of the acquired businesses.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteMoreover, costs associated with the merger and other acquisitions, such as UXC and Xchanging, are likely to mar the company’s bottom-line results in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, prior to the completion of merger, Computer Sciences Corporation had taken additional debt. This has increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden. The increase in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s bottom-line results.Apart from this, increased competition, delay in government’s order renewal process and constricted federal spending may adversely affect its results in the fiscal first quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DXC Technology will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for DXC Technology is -0.80%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.24 per share is a penny lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), expected to release earnings on Aug 24, currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.57% and a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Aug 10, currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

84,DXC,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of LabAnswer, a research and laboratory informatics technology consulting firm. Notably, the two companies had entered into the deal last month. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Headquartered in Sugar Land, TX, LabAnswer is specialized in providing informatics consultancy services to scientific and research laboratories. With approximately 250 employees, apart from life sciences, the company offers its services to various other industries, including chemicals, resources, energy, consumer goods, and government.With the successful completion of the buyout, the company has established a new business division – Accenture Scientific Informatics Services.Accenture is planning to leverage its digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, analytics and cloud, with a fundamental redesign of the scientific user experience. With this, the company’s new division will be able to help life sciences companies in better capturing, managing, integrating and analyzing complex research data, thereby giving better ideas to identify new and more effective treatments for patients.We believe that this acquisition will enhance Accenture’s portfolio of life sciences services. The acquisition of LabAnswer will not only bring in a huge talent pool, but will also expand its reach in different markets.We are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Notably, shares of Accenture have outperformed the industry, over the last one year. The stock has gained 13.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%.Nonetheless, Accenture’s latest announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities will likely dent its bottom-line results. Increasing competition from the likes of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report), as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter the company’s growth to some extent.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Exponent Inc. (EXPO  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed the same in one occasion, over the trailing four quarters. The long-term expected EPS growth rate for the company is 12%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

85,DXC,"DXC Technology (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is providing Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report) with a new “human resources (HR) and payroll deployment” system meant for enterprises with an employee range of 3,500 to 15,000.Per the press release, this service is “a fixed-price, preconfigured deployment of Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) and Workday Payroll” and can be seamlessly integrated into the ongoing operations of an enterprise.Workday is one of the leading providers of cloud-based HCM and financial management software solutions. Troy Richardson, senior vice president and general manager of Enterprise and Cloud Applications at DXC stated, “As a certified Workday services partner, we’ve been able to deploy Workday’s world-class software to our large enterprise clients, including more than 600,000 people in over 100 countries.”Notably, in the current scenario, clients prefer to rely on cloud-based services as it makes their IT system more agile and productive, leading to considerable cost savings. Thus, the need for cloud-based deployment of HCM and payroll services is increasing.Per a recent report by Gartner, the worldwide public cloud service is expected to reach $411.4 billion by 2020. We believe that with cloud computing being one of the major revenue generating sectors of DXC, expansion of the related client base will be beneficial for the company’s top line. This will help it to make the most of the growth opportunity in the market.DXC Technology Company. Price DXC Technology Company. Price | DXC Technology Company.

The company currently has 180 employees and operates through its offices in Toronto and Halifax.By integrating VERAX, Accenture will not only get a large talent pool, but will also gain a huge customer base in Canada, thereby expanding its reach in different markets.

87,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of a Senior Floating Rate Notes offering worth $650 million. Notes, carrying an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.95% per year, are set to mature in 2021.Per the company, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated will lead the underwriting syndicate. Security brokerage and dealership services provider will act as the sole active bookrunner and representative of underwriters.DXC Technology intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which also include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing high demand. We believe that these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. As of Jun 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.25 billion, while it paid $76 million as interest expenses during first-quarter fiscal 2018, which was 200% higher than the year-ago quarter tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt primarily increased this year. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Additionally, the company noted that the merger has opened up new avenues of growth and will help the combined entity to become a leading player in the IT services domain. Post merger, DXC Technology became the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).However, we believe that the benefits of this merger will come over the long run, as DXC Technology’s near-term results are likely to bear the impact of the integration of the acquired businesses.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).DXC Technology stock has gained 21.1% since Apr 1, substantially outperforming the 12% rally of the industry it belongs to.A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is CSRA Inc. , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

88,DXC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 18.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DXC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.DXC Technology's Q4 Earnings & Revenues Top EstimatesDXC Technology reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein its top and bottom lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also marked robust year-over-year improvements. The robust quarterly results were mainly driven by the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.Notably, in 2016, Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a spin-off-merger agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation, wherein it agreed to spin-off its Enterprise Services division and merge the same with the latter’s businesses. The transaction closed on Apr 1, 2017, and the new entity was named DXC Technology.Coming back to the fiscal fourth-quarter results, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.28 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19, and also increased year over year.Quarter DetailsRevenues in the quarter came in at $6.294 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $$6.12 billion. On a pro forma combined company basis, the company registered year-over-year growth of 4.3%. However, on a constant-currency basis, revenues edged down 1.3% year over year.Segment wise, pro forma revenues from Global Business Services (GBS) increased 3.3% on a year-over-year basis to $2.36 billion. The company continues to witness shift in traditional application services to enterprise and cloud applications.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the fiscal fourth quarter came in at $3.22 billion, marking 3.3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma combined company basis. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by growth in the company’s “cloud and platform services as well as mobility and workplace.”USPS revenues came in at $710 million during the quarter, up 11.1% year over year on a pro forma combined company basis. Notably, this was the last quarter when the company reported USPS results as its operating segment. As the spin-off of USPS will close on June 1, this year, the company will not include this segment under its operating results anymore.The company’s adjusted operating income from continuing operations, on a pro forma combined company basis, amounted to $1.03 billion. Adjusted operating margin came in at 16.2% as compared with 10.2% reported in the prior-year quarter, on a pro forma combined company basis. The robust improvement was mainly driven by the achievement of approximately $1.1 billion of cost synergies from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services division merger during fiscal 2018.Adjusted net income from continuing operations came in at $661 million during the quarter as compared with $387 million reported in the year-earlier period on a pro forma combined company basis.The company exited the reported quarter with $2.648 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.926 billion recorded in the previous quarter. Long-term debt balance (net of current maturities) was $6.306 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal came in at $3.243 billion. Adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2018 came in at $2.427 billion. During this period, the company returned $306 million to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments.Fiscal 2019 OutlookThe company initiated fiscal 2019 outlook. For the fiscal, DXC Technology projects revenues of $21.5-$22 billion. The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share between $7.75 and $8.15. During the fiscal, the company projects incremental cost savings of $400 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus  DXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus | DXC Technology Company. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, DXC has a nice Growth Score of B. Its Momentum is doing a bit better with an A. The stock was also allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise DXC has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

89,DXC,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in DXC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 10 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $9.04 a share a month ago to its current level of $8.18.Also, for the current quarter, DXC Technology has seen five downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.74 a share from $1.98 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 18.1% in the past month.DXC Technology Company.

90,DXC,"Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2019 results on May 24.In the last reported quarter, the company reported non-GAAP loss of 9 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. The figure was also better than the company’s guided range of a loss of 10-14 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 21.7%.Revenues of $553.8 million beat the consensus mark of $545.3 million and increased nearly 15.7% year over year. The figure surpassed the guided range of $537-$547 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsAutodesk’s results are expected to be driven by its core business, which comprises maintenance, product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions.Autodesk is gaining from robust growth in product subscription. Autodesk’s broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. The company’s growing maintenance to subscription program coupled with increasing adoption of Collections is a tailwind.Moreover, increasing spend by customers of Collections is leading to an increase in the company’s average recurring revenues (ARR) and average revenue per subscriptions (ARPS).For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARR is $2.12 billion, up 21.7% from the reported number in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company’s e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription sales in the last reported quarter. Moreover, half of AutoCAD LT subscriptions in the United States came through the e-store.Although cloud remains a very small contributor to Autodesk’s total business, growing momentum of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is a positive.However, churn rate for maintenance subscribers is expected to remain high, given the rise in cost of staying on a maintenance plan.Management expects billings growth in the quarter to be impacted by tough year-over-year comparison as the company recorded strong billings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Further, cash flow in the quarter will be negatively impacted by the company’s restructuring activity and exit tax related to the shift of European operations center to Dublin from Switzerland.Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Autodesk, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

91,DXC,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 13 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings once last year. In fourth-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive trend, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $2.51 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 by 2.9%.The bottom-line figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter tally of $2.21. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution, backed by the company’s efficient business model, also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.On a GAAP basis, Waters Corp. reported a loss of $4.44 per share compared with earnings of $2.15 in fourth-quarter 2016. The company’s GAAP profitability was adversely affected by a huge, one-time expense of income tax of about $550 million.For the full year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $7.49 per share, reflecting impressive growth of 14% over the previous year.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 9% year over year to $687 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $671 million. For the full year, revenues grew 7% year over year to $2.3 billion.The upside in the quarter’s top line came on the back of robust performance in the bio/pharmaceutical end markets (up 11% year over year), and the government and academic market (up 17% year over year). The momentum was further backed by 3% growth in the industrial end markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth.

DXC Technology stock has gained 61.6% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 40.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at the key aspects aiding the company’s performance.The FormationDXC Technology was formed following the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was completed on Apr1, 2017.  The combined entity has become the world’s second-largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc.The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom and expanded the avenues of growth for the combined company.Focused SegmentsDXC Technology focuses on the cyber business, cloud computing market and Big Data.Organizations are transitioning to cloud at an accelerated pace. According to Gartner’s latest report, at 2016-end total market size of SaaS was approximately $144 billion. However, during the year, total cloud shift to SaaS was just $36 billion.

Therefore, DXC Technology is expected to benefit from this untapped opportunity.AcquisitionsFollowing the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology is making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which is likely to drive growth in the long run. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions that of Tribridge and Logicalis SMC.The integration of Logicalis SMC business will fortify DXC Technology’s position as a leading global software integrator for ServiceNow (NOW  -  Free Report). Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition is crucial for DXC Technology.PartnershipsApart from buyouts, the company expanded ties with VMware at VMworld 2017. The two entities are coming together to debut the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next generation hybrid cloud platform. This contract will enable DXC Technology’s clients to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver enhanced performance for networking customers.Spin-OffThe company recently announced the spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequent merger of the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares and $1.05 billion of cash from USPS.

93,DXC,"Amdocs Limited (DOX  -  Free Report) has unveiled the industry’s first 5G-ready online charging system. This path breaking product is expected to change the way service providers monetize network and data access, enabling newer and more effective ways of generating revenues for them.As leading service providers gear up to commercially deploy 5G services, 5G network slicing capability is likely to become an essential feature. These network slices will aid in meeting varying needs of different services and users. Amdocs’s 5G-ready online charging system will ensure that the level of activity in one network slice does not impact another through its innovative isolation mechanism.5G is being cited as the radical new technology that will help build smart cities, allow autonomous vehicle driving and enable drones to provide faster medical aid for high emergency regions. 5G network is also expected to provide higher bandwidth, lower latency and greater agility for users.Once 5G becomes available for public use, it will present a huge potential if its new network and the product configurations made through network slicing are effectively monetized. Amdocs aims to help service providers do the same with its recently upgraded digital monetization solution.According to IHS research, by 2035, approximately $12.3 trillion worth of goods and services will be enabled by 5G networks, adding nearly 22 million jobs and approximately $3 trillion to worldwide GDP.

According to a study by telecommunications firm Ericsson, there is expected to be  over 6 billion smartphone users by 2020.Being the first in the industry to develop 5G-ready online charging system, it remains to be seen whether Amdocs gets the first mover advantage in an industry slated to grow by leaps and bounds.Amdocs’ shares have underperformed the industry in the last three months with an average gain of 4.4% compared with a rise of 11.3% for the latter.Amdocs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

96,DXC,"For this Global Week Ahead, let’s look into Reuter’s Five World themes…(1) World Stock Markets Party OnWorld stocks started the year with their best week in over a year. While it’s tempting to say “same old, same old” as markets smash another host of milestones and records, you still have to take a step back and assess what’s happening.There are some who will dismiss this as another bout of mindless bubble blowing and insist it will all end in tears. Perhaps it will. But the more sober assessment is that we are going through the first boom in the world economy in over a decade.Global industrial output raced higher at more than a +5% annualized rate last month and more than +4% for the fourth quarter as a whole.The G10 economic surprise index – which nets positive over negative hits and misses on incoming data – continues to hover close to its most positive readings in almost 8 years.(2) The U.S. Q4 Earnings Season BeginsThe Q4 earnings season comes back onto the radar, with the big U.S. financials kicking off at the end of the week.On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and rival Wells Fargo launch the earnings season with reports before the opening bell. Even despite the record low financial market volatility that’s crimping trading revenues, deal making has been super brisk over recent months and overall fee income from banks around the world rose some 16% last year to a record level of more than $100 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.The numbers should be good. Blended year-on-year Q4 earnings growth for the S&P 500 overall is expected to be +11.9%, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates, up from +8.5% in Q3. Excluding the energy sector, which benefits from weak year-earlier comparisons, it is seen at +9.5%.Data -- which runs since 1994 -- shows that in a typical quarter 64% of companies beat estimates and 21% miss estimates. Over the past four quarters, however, 72% have beaten the Street estimates and only 19% have missed them.(3) North and South Korea MeetOn Tuesday, officials from North and South Korea will meet for their first official talks in more than two years.Agreeing to the meeting represents a turnaround by Kim Jong-Un’s regime, which has focused in the past 12 months on developing its nuclear arsenal amid bellicose exchanges with U.S. President Donald Trump, raising alarm across the world.The meeting is expected to focus on the North potentially sending athletes to the Winter Olympics to be held in the South in February as well as on some other inter-Korean relations, according to Seoul.Geopolitical analysts will scrutinize every word and gesture, as they try to judge if this really is a re-emerging detente between the two nations, not to mention the reaction from Trump’s twitter account.(4) Mainland China Fundamentals Hit the TapeA blizzard of data is expected to show China’s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note. However, activity has remained more resilient than expected despite a crackdown on industrial pollution, overzealous lending and a cooling property market.The week kicks off with forex reserves data and a bunch of inflation numbers, before the focus will switch to trade figures out on Friday. Exports are expected to have jumped more than 9 percent in December after soaring unexpectedly 12.3 percent in November thanks to sustained strength in global demand.A slight pullback in December industrial growth, producer inflation and investment would all reinforce consensus views that the world’s second-largest economy will slow only marginally in 2018. A more marked loss of momentum may put fears of a sharper slowdown back on the table, unsettle the Yuan and possibly stall the government’s push to reduce rising debt.  (5) Europe’s Clearing Blue SkiesIt may be the depths of winter with storms tearing across the euro zone, but the political and economic skies are almost cloudless all of a sudden.This week, Angela Merkel will try to re-form a “grand coalition,” an effort that could rumble on for a few months. Campaigning for Italy’s uncertain election in March is also getting underway. But the rest of the bloc looks buoyant.Last Friday, perhaps the most eye-catching thing was that crisis poster child Greece’s borrowing costs hit their lowest level in 12 years. Expectations are that the country could conclude its Euro zone/IMF bailout package later this year.That would cap a slowly strengthening recovery eight years after Greece lurched on the brink of defaulting on its debt and risked being kicked out of the single currency bloc.Top Zacks Stocks---Statoil ASA : This is Norway’s $75 billion market cap integrated oil and gas company. With oil prices moving higher, these types of stocks are in a Momentum Trading pattern. The long-term Zacks VGM score is A here, too.Micron (MU  -  Free Report): It’s a New Year.

This $27 billion market cap stock continues to carry a long-term Zacks VGM score of A.DXC computer services fall into these buckets: Analytics, Application, Business Process, Cloud, Consulting, Enterprise and Cloud Applications, Security, Workplace and Mobility, and Other Industries. Let’s move on -- to the most compelling global macro fundamentals to focus on this week.Key Global Macro--In many parts of the globe, the biggest macro lands together -- on Friday.On Friday, the core U.S. consumer inflation rate, the CPI (ex-food and energy) comes out.After five consecutive months of 1.7% y/y core CPI inflation readings, October showed a glimmer of hope for Fed watchers when it climbed a tick. Then November dipped back to the sixth 1.7% y/y reading. Regardless, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the PCE price deflator. This arrives on January 29th. That core inflation reading has been trending very gently higher since August.On Friday, watch out for India’s CPI, too. The Reserve Bank of India is on inflation watch and will therefore have a keen eye on next Friday’s report. The November CPI print climbed to 4.9% y/y and inflation has trended upward since hitting a low of 1.5% y/y in June. The RBI’s inflation target range is 4% +/-2%. So, their CPI remains within the band.Mainland China will update export and import trade growth figures towards the end of the week (also out on Friday in the USA).On Monday, the Eurozone Business Climate (at 1.49), Consumer Sentiment (+0.5), Industrial Sentiment (at 8.2) and Economic Confidence (at 114.6) indexes come out. These should show a stronger expansion, overall.Eurozone retail sales also come out. The annual growth rate has been running at +0.4% y/y. That looks anemic, still.On Tuesday, the 7-day repo rate (the monetary policy rate) for Argentina gets set. The prior was 28.75%. The new rate should be 28%.In Australia, the ANZ says job additions are running +1.5% m/m and building approvals are at +0.9% m/m.The U.S. NFIB small business optimism index should move from 107.5 to 107. Those numbers well above 100 are positive.Brazil’s retail sales come out. The prior was +7.5% y/y and the forecast is for +5.2% y/y.Mexico’s bi-weekly CPI is forecast to rise from +6.69% to 6.91% y/y. That is not good, and it is related to a weaker peso exchange rate, making imports more expensive.The Eurozone unemployment rate comes out. It has been at 8.8%.On Wednesday, the Polish Central Bank should leave rates at 1.5%.The U.K.’s industrial production looks to fall to +2.8% y/y from +3.6% y/y.On Thursday, Germany’s GDP growth (not seasonally adjusted) should be +1.9% y/y.The Eurozone industrial production growth rate comes out. The prior was +3.7% y/y.Greece’s unemployment rate comes out. 20.5% is the last reading.U.S. initial claims should be low again. The last week was 250K.Mexico’s industrial production comes out. It looks worrisome. The last reading was -1.1% y/y, and the new reading could be -1.2% y/y. NAFTA fear and Trump tax changes weigh heavily.On Friday, Mainland China’s exports and imports come out. The last figures showed +12.3% y/y growth in exports and +17.7% y/y growth in imports.India’s CPI should get to +5.1% y/y from +4.88% y/y.The U.S. CPI comes out and the Fed will be watching closely. The last reading was +0.1% m/m and the new reading should add +0.2% m/m.The Fed’s Rosengren speaks in San Diego.

97,DXC,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 24.Last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.86%. In fact, Medtronic’s bottom line outpaced estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.54%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe look forward to another quarter of solid growth on the company’s successful execution of three growth strategies such as therapy innovation, globalization and an increase in Medtronic’s economic value. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should further get reflected in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote The space for therapy innovation is filled with multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG), new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets for left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.In the to-be-reported quarter, Medtronic is expected to have maintained a market share in the core pacing, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) and CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) product lines within the scope of CRHF (cardiac rhythm and heart failure) while creating new meaningful markets to enhance the company’s weighted average market growth.Within the TAVR space, the company hopes to see continued global growth on strong adoption of Evolut PRO valve around the world as well as expansion in the traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture, resulting from Medtronic’s new intermediate risk indication.After several quarters of dull Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance in coronary, the company’s DES product line witnessed growth in both the United States and Japan since the last few quarters. This upside is driven by the recent launch of Resolute Onyx in the said markets. Further, these developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for a strong quarterly performance by the company.Notably, following the FDA approval in February, Medtronic announced the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm DES, the smallest sized DES in the market. We expect this to contribute to the company’s DES business in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $3.10 billion, 9.1% higher than the year-ago number of $2.85 billion.Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), surgical innovations should register sturdy growth, driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. Advanced stapling growth should come on the back of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology as well as Signia. Advanced Energy growth should bank on a consistent rollout of the company’s LigaSure instruments and Valleylab FT10 energy platform.Medtronic currently remains confident about its ability to grow MITG in the mid-single-digit over the longer term.Within the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG), the company witnesses encouraging developments regarding the brain therapy space. This division experienced 5% growth during the fiscal third quarter, driven by high teens growth in neurovascular and strong sales of StealthStation navigation as well as O-arm imaging technologies, which further led to low double-digit growth in neurosurgery. We expect this bullish trend to continue in the last-completed quarter as well.Within Pain, the company awaits a positive customer uptake from Intellis platform and an evolved workflow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTG revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter stands at $2.09 billion, 60.3% above the year-ago reported figure.Here’s What the Quantitative Model Predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Medtronic has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this period to be reported. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to surpass estimates in the upcoming releases:Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.01% and a Zacks Rank #2.

98,DXC,"Subdued inflation mollified concerns that the Federal Reserve might speed up rate hikes this year. In the wake of this, investors’ appetite for riskier assets, including tech and energy, has increased, pushing major bourses higher. In turn, market volatility continued to ebb.Thus, picking stocks from desirable sectors seems prudent. And why not? Buffet’s bet on Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Facebook, Inc.’s (FB  -  Free Report) shrugging off of the data fiasco have boosted investor confidence. Meanwhile, energy shares have shifted to high gear as oil touched its highest level since November 2014.Wall Street Rallies: Here’s WhyThe Dow Jones added nearly 200 points on May 10 to notch its longest string of advances — six straight days – since Feb 16. And if the blue-chip index can gain on May 11, it will mark its longest winning streak since Oct 5, 2017. The broader S&P 500 finished in the green, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq registering its fifth successive day of gains.Stocks scaled higher as the tumultuous market phase seems to have faded — at least for the time being. Softer inflation numbers helped allay fears of faster interest rate hikes this year, while concerns about a US-China trade war have somewhat subsided.Tepid Inflation Data, Trade War Fears SubsideRising inflation played spoilsport at the beginning of the year. It compelled the Fed to quicken its monetary policy instead of raising rates at a gradual pace, aggravating market fears. But, softer-than-expected rise in consumer prices in the month of April cooled inflation fears. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in April from the prior month, per the Labor Department. Market pundits, however, expects the CPI to tick up to 0.3%.Fears about a full-blown trade war between the two largest economies, the United States and China, have been doing the rounds for quite some time. This in turn could deal a massive blow to the global economy. However, China is expected to import more American goods as the two sides are looking for means to avert an all-out trade war.Volatility EbbWith investors’ anxiety seems to have eased, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” — fell for the sixth straight session, down 2.4% to 13.09 on May 10. Now, the index is likely to slip to its lowest close since Jan 26.This indicated that the index has almost erased the huge spike witnessed in early February. During that time period, concerns over inflation saw the index more than double in a single session. Moreover, the VIX’s average level is 20. Thus, the current level is extremely low compared to historical standards.Appetite for Riskier Assets RisesWith fears taking a back seat, investors are looking to bet on riskier assets. Technology and Internet stocks regained their crown as the most sought-after stocks. Bellwethers Apple and Facebook, to name a few, saw their shares move north. The recent tax cut has already given the much needed windfall to tech, while cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data remain growth areas (read more: Buffett's Bet on Apple Sparks Tech Rally: 5 Solid Buys).One of the least popular sectors last year, energy, is now hogging the limelight. It’s kind of a comeback for them as oil prices springs above the $71 a barrel. Iran sanctions have majorly kept oil prices at a three and a half year peak. A cut in global oil output initiated by the OPEC and other major oil producers, including Russia, has helped prices more than double from the collapse in early 2016.

99,DXC,"Per the latest report from Institute of Supply Management (ISM), service activity in the United States grew for the 99th consecutive month, indicating flourishing non-manufacturing activity.Despite maintaining its growth for a long streak, the metric actually came in lower than expected for the month of April. This decline is rather a seasonal fluctuation, with the majority of the surveyed industries stating that trade-war related tensions and Trump’s tariff polices actually weighed on service activity in the United States.However, the fact that the metric has expanded for close to a hundred months and all of the 18 non-manufacturing industries have reported growth, makes investing in business service stocks a prudent decision.Despite Dip, Service Activity Still BoomingThe Institute of Supply Management reported on May 3 that non-manufacturing activity for April came in at 56.8%, lower than the consensus estimate of 58.1% and last month’s figure of 58.8%. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.However, the decline should be brushed aside as momentary owing to trade-war worries that have made suppliers across the globe nervous. With Trump’s decision to postpone the imposition of import tariffs on steel purchases, such tensions have somewhat subsided. Further, all of the 18 industries which the metric tracks, actually reported growth in the last month.Business Activity, New Orders SurgeFurther, Prices Index advanced by 0.3 percentage points to 61.8%, representing an increase in prices in April for the 26th month on the trot. Moreover, the ISM Business Activity Index registered growth of 59.1% in April to report growth in business activity for the 105th consecutive month. Notably, all of the 15 industries reported an increase in business activity for April.Looking at other positive developments from the report, the non-manufacturing New Orders Index surged to 60% in the month. This represents an advancement for 87 straight months that too at an accelerated rate when compared with March. Finally, the non-manufacturing Employment Index surged to 53.6%, expanding for the 50th month on the trot.4 Top PicksDespite the decline in April, service activity in the United States expanded for 99 straight months. This represents a burgeoning service sector in the country. Further, the fact that all of the 18 sectors have reported growth in the period underlines the fact that betting on business service stocks would provide investors with handsome returns.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These five stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CRA International, Inc. (CRAI  -  Free Report) provides financial and business consulting services.The company is based out of Boston and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

100,DXC,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.8% over the past month. CACI hit a new 52-week high of $160.20 in the previous session. CACI International has gained 20.3% since the start of the year compared to the 7.2% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 7.6% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 31, 2018, CACI International reported EPS of $2 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.94%.For the current fiscal year, CACI International is expected to post earnings of $11.19 per share on $4.46 billion in revenues. This represents a 71.36% change in EPS on a 2.38% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.75 per share on $4.61 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -21.86% and 3.42%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCACI International may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CACI? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.CACI International has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 16.2X versus its peer group's average of 16.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.42. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.CACI International, Inc. Price and Consensus  CACI International, Inc. Price and Consensus | CACI International, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, CACI International currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2  and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if CACI International fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though CACI shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does CACI International Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of CACI International have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (SAIC  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company. (DXC  -  Free Report), and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 43% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CACI, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

104,DXC,"The year 2017 was a blockbuster year for investors as all the three major indices indicating the health of the U.S. market closed at record levels. An improved economic data for GDP, steady job additions, a favorable Consumer Confidence Index as well as factory activity data kept investors optimistic about the economy.The Tech sector was one of the largest beneficiaries of this rally, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) registering a return of 32.2% in the last year, on top of a 12.9% gain it registered in 2016.Tech Stocks Poised for Further GrowthThe technology sector is likely to grow further in 2018, as evident from the recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) on worldwide IT spending. The latest report from the independent research firm projects global IT spending to reach $3.7 trillion this year, representing an increase of 4.3% from $3.5 trillion projected in 2017.The sector will continue to benefit from the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.However, in our opinion, the major push will come from the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax bill as it will bring double benefit for tech companies. Firstly, it will lift corporate earnings and secondly, as companies across other sectors might utilize savings from lower tax as well as cash repatriations for technological upgradation this will again be conducive for the tech stocks.Naturally, investing in the tech space makes perfect sense at this point.Where to Put Your Money?Today, we’ve zeroed-in on some tech stocks using our premium screen “VGM Style Score” which had performed phenomenally last year and have the potential to carry the momentum this year as well.Our first choice is the world’s leading memory chip maker — Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). The main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM and NAND chips. This is primarily due to imbalances between industry demand and supply, which are leading to periodic shortage and temporary price hike. We believe Micron will continue its outperformance as long as demand for memory chips remains ahead of supply.Based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Micron is anticipated to finish fiscal 2018 with EPS growth of 102.2% and sales growth of 36.9%. Micron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock and has a VGM Score of A. Last year, the stock rallied 87.5%.

DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which was concluded on Apr 1, 2017.The merger has opened up avenues of growth and will help the combined entity become a leading player in the IT services domain. Post merger, DXC Technology became the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc. Since April 1 through Dec 29, 2017, shares of DXC Technology gained 37.6%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, DXC Technology has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10.5%. On top of this, the stock currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 13.2x, which is lower than the industry average of 29x.

106,DXC,"Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (SIMO  -  Free Report) remains well-poised for growth, driven by synergies from acquisitions and improving NAND supply environment. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock bears immense potential owing to a few good growth drivers. However, growth momentum might get hindered by stiff competition and macroeconomic risks like political, economic and social instability.Shares of Silicon Motionhave gained 14.9% in the past three months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 5.2% rally.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Key DriversSilicon Motion is a leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices and specialty RF ICs for mobile devices.The company is anticipated to benefit from an improving NAND supply environment. Management expects the increase in the availability of 64 layer 3D NAND to bring down the high NAND prices, which will eventually improve the financial results.

107,DXC,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Genpact Limited (G  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 32.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the 9.1% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryGenpact has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 10.4%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Genpact’s fiscal 2017 witnessed upward revisions.

The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 21.7x, significantly lower than the Zacks industry’s average of 29.2x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Other Driving FactorsGenpact’s domain expertise in business analytics, digital and consulting sectors is a key catalyst for growth.Notably, management is positive about the growing pipeline on the back of increasing adoption of the company’s transformation services. The enthusiastic approach of the C-level of different companies in transforming business models through digital, data and analytics is turning out to be a positive.Additionally, supply chain management is another sector where the company has growth opportunities. Being recognized as one of the top three leaders in supply chain management by The Everest Group is another positive.We believe its diverse portfolio, enhanced by the offerings of the acquired organizations, will provide Genpact with a competitive advantage against peers like Cognizant Technology Solutions and Accenture.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Genpact is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Thus, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksGenpact carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

108,DXC,"Markets have delivered a robust performance in 2017 with the major benchmarks scaling new highs. The S&P 500 is currently at its highest level at 2,687.54 points, reflecting a 20.2% year-to-date gain. At 24,837.51 points, the Dow has also witnessed a 25.3% year-to-date increase. Although, we have witnessed a series of natural disasters this year that have affected Florida, Houston, Northern California, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, these could not bring the market down.What’s Behind the 2017 Market Boom?Strong earnings and steady economic growth have helped the market to flourish in 2017. It boosted investor sentiment. In the third quarter of 2017, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies were up 6.9% year over year. Also, per the Department of Commerce, U.S. Real GDP increased 3.2% in the third quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2015.Another economic index, unemployment is at a 17-year low of 4.1%, while 228,000 new jobs were added in November alone. The majority of the increase came from construction firms and manufacturers. Hiring in the space increased during the recovery from storm-related disruptions. Annual hourly pay also climbed up 2.5%, strengthening the labor market. The effect of these improvements is expected to continue in 2018 as well.Finally, the Trump effect was a significant trigger for the market. Several industries witnessed a strong boost due to his corporate-friendly policies. Exports have increased rapidly in the last few quarters. U.S. companies have benefited from his plans and we expect them to do so in the coming quarters. Notably, total earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to increase 8.6% year over year, backed by 6.8% higher revenues. The energy sector, with a whopping 168.4% year-over-year projected earnings growth, is expected to lead the market in the quarter. Arguably, the best of the lot (policies) is the tax-cut, which brought the corporate tax rate down to 21% from 35%.How Will Things Shape Up in 2018?We believe that with a healthy labor market, low interest rates, strong U.S. dollar and oil prices well below their 2014 peak, the world's largest economy may have more leg to run in 2018. In fact, we expect average S&P 500 earnings in 2018 to rise by an impressive 11.7% year over year. This calls for investing in growth stocks, which can help investors benefit the most from the current bullish trend.Selecting the right growth stocks is not an easy job.

110,DXC,"There are many ‘calendar trends’ in the financial markets which indicate its outperformance or underperformance in a given time frame. The common axioms are“Sell in May and go away”, the “January Effect” and the “January Barometer”, to name a few.These calendar trends do have a logical basis in contrast to some random time frame showing gains and losses. For instance, markets typically scale north in two weeks after the Tax Day, which is on Apr 17 this year. This is because money flows into the market as a significant number of people start funding their Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) in order to receive tax deduction.Tax Day, thus, brings a seasonal trend where you can make some gains, with a few sectors traditionally showing an improvement. Apr 17 is Tax Day This Year: Here’s WhySince 1955, Tax Day has been observed on Apr 15. But, if the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the filing of federal income tax returns is pushed to the next business day. This means that tax day should have been on Monday, Apr 16 this year.However, the Emancipation day holiday unique to Washington D.C. fell on Apr 16, postponing the tax filing deadline this year. District of Columbia observes Emancipation day, which marks the freeing of slaves in Washington in 1892. This makes Apr 17 the closing date for filing taxes in the United States.Tax Day TradeTax Day is always special for the stock market. Estimates are that 15% to 33% of all tax filers wait for this day to fund their IRAs. After all, IRAs are a basket of various asset classes, including stocks in which individuals invest money to prepare for retirement.The average daily gain, by the way, for the S&P 500 on the Tax Day has been around 0.3% over the past 10 years. But, don’t dismiss 0.3% as meager because it is nearly 7 points on the S&P that equates to an annualized gain of around 75% over the average 252 trading days in a year.In fact, April has always been one of the best months for the S&P. The broader index in the past 10 and five years has climbed about 90% and 80% of times this month, respectively.The benchmark index, however, this time around is down so far in the month. So, this indicates that some sort of a bounce back may take place during the remaining of the month that will push the index back into positive territory.End of Tax Season Throws Open Buying ProspectsThe stock market, historically, tends to gain momentum in the two weeks following the Tax Day. Conversely, stocks tend to remain flat or somewhat down in the first two weeks of April.The S&P has been nearly down on an average 0.2% in the first two weeks of the month, while it was up around 1.7% on an average during the weeks following the day, per data analytics firm Kensho. That’s a positive swing of about 2% on average for the S&P 500. Similarly, certain sectors like technology, financials and industrials have notched average gains of around 3%, 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively.Profit From Tax Season With These 5 StocksGiven that the aforesaid sectors are poised to make the most of the upcoming bullishness, investing in stocks from the same will be judicious. And why not? The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates has provided the much-needed windfall to tech companies, while a recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for financials. Firm business investment, in the meantime, helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Style Score of A or B.

111,DXC,"The Driehaus strategy focuses on investing in momentum stocks using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. Investors with high-risk appetite can think of buying momentum stocks using this particular investment approach. The strategy is considered as one of the most successful investment approachs. Following its success, Driehaus earned a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10- year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.A Look at Driehaus StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus’ strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.“I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,” Driehaus had said in an interview.Screening ParametersThe percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2%(Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business.)• Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median(Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5%(Positive EPS surprise indicates potential.)• Positive % 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks(High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend.)• Momentum Score equal to or less than B(A favorable Momentum Score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.)These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7,905 stocks to only 19.Here are five of the 19 stocks:The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is a manufacturer and marketer of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.The company has a Momentum Score of A and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18%.DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is a provider of information technology services and solutions.

112,DXC,"As the eventful 2017 comes to a close, we believe this is the right time to make your investment plans for the upcoming year. Investors can consider Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) which has generated high returns for investors in the year so far and has the potential to exceed expectations in the next year as well.The stock has appreciated approximately 59%, outperforming the industry’s return of 44.2%.Let’s look at the reasons behind Marvell’s solid momentum.What’s Driving the Stock?Marvell is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. Over the coming years, it projects an increasing number of PCs/servers to use flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market is witnessing a steady rise in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data. The NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand is likely to remain robust in the coming year as well.SSD demand will also shoot up and might even surpass the manufacturing capacity, leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term. Marvell is benefiting from the increasing demand for SSD products. This is evident from the sequential increase in the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues from the storage end market, which accounted for majority of total revenues.Furthermore, we believe the elevated demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products could be a key growth driver. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of recently-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.In addition, the company’s recent restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve its cloud infrastructure and applications, which are anticipated to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects its sound financial position and favorable prospects.Also, the company’s four back-to-back quarters of better-than-expected bottom-line results have boosted investors’ confidence in the stock. Apart from this, an encouraging fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 outlook provided in the last quarterly earnings conference call also makes us optimistic about its near-term performance.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and fiscal 2018 has been revised upward. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 31 cents, up 3 cents from earnings of 28 cents projected 30 days ago. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is currently pegged at $1.19 compared with $1.14 estimated 30 days ago.Valuation Looks AttractiveFrom a valuation perspective, the stock looks attractive as it is currently trading significantly lower than the industry average, based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. Marvell currently trades at a forward P/E of 18.6x compared with the industry group average of 26.8x.Hence, there is still much momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is quite evident from its VGM Style Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 16.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Keeping these positives in mind, we believe Marvell is one such technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio for better returns next year.Some Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector that have favourable Zacks Rank and VGM Score are Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), SMART Global Holdings (SGH  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology (DXC  -  Free Report). All three sport a Zacks Rank of 1 and have VGM Score of A.Long-term expected EPS growth rates for Micron, SMART Global Holdings and DXC Technology are 10%, 15% and 10.5%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

113,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is on track to complete its planned spin-off of the U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merge the same with the company’s pending acquisitions of Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions ahead of time. This is because the company has been granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The HSR Act seeks to ensure due filing of all documents necessary for mergers, acquisitions and transfer of assets or securities by companies with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice.Notably, the three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing entity, primarily to the U.S. government. Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital.Transaction DetailsPer the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, thereby making the entire transaction tax free for DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon completion of the spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.On the other hand, Veritas Capital will receive approximately 14% shareholding and a cash consideration of $400 million on completion of the entire transaction.The current president and CEO of Vencore — Mac Curtis — will hold the position of chief executive officer of the new company, while Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, DXC USPS, will serve as the chief operating officer. Mike Lawrie chairman, president and CEO of DXC, will chair the board of the new entity, while names for other positions will be decided later.Reason for the DealPer the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC Technology’s latest spin-merger move is anticipated to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients. On the successful formation, the new entity will become one of the top five IT services providers to the U.S. government.Furthermore, it should be noted that Vencore is well known for providing cyber security, engineering, analytics and other IT solutions to the federal government, while KeyPoint is specialized in offering investigative services to a wide range of sectors, including federal, defense, intelligence and civilian sectors.Hence, per the company, the above-mentioned transaction is likely to fortify its capabilities in “offering differentiated, mission-driven solutions in cybersecurity, big data analytics, cloud engineering, enterprise IT services, and systems engineering – all enabled by a portfolio of cutting-edge Intellectual Property (IP).”The reinforced capabilities will help the new company win government contracts, in turn bringing in more revenues, in our opinion.Boosting Shareholders’ WealthThe latest move comes just months after DXC Technology came into existence in April this year. Notably, the company is a result of the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The transaction has enhanced shareholders’ value of both companies. Additionally, it has opened up new opportunities for driving the company’s growth.Therefore, we believe the recent spin-merger transaction of the USPS business will not only boost DXC Technology’s shareholders’ value in the near term, but will also continue to create wealth over the long run.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 37.2%, significantly outperforming the industry’s return of 26%.Currently, DXC Technology flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

114,DXC,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Mellanox Technologies Inc. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 57.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 34.3% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.What’s Working in Favor of Mellanox?In the last reported quarter, Mellanox has delivered a positive earnings surprise 10.9%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 16%.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mellanox’s next quarter witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next quarter is currently pegged at 47 cents per share compared with 46 cents per share projected 30 days ago. Notably, none of the estimates moved downward.The company recently announced collaboration with NEC Corporation to provide support to NEC’s newly announced SX-Aurora TSUBASA systems with its InfiniBand adapters. InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers. These design wins are likely to aid top-line growth.Apart from strong demand for Mellanox’s InfiniBand solutions, collaborations with the likes of Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have helped it expand footprint in the cloud and datacenter market.Mellanox is winning contracts from the likes of NetApp. Additionally, the company’s collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also anticipated to reinforce its footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Market research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. This exponential growth bodes well for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions owing to growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Mellanox is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMellanox sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) are some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies flaunt the same Zacks Rank as Mellanox.NVIDIA, DXC and Analog Devices have a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%, 10.5% and 10.4%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

115,DXC,"Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its rising share price and strong fundamentals. Shares of Shopifyhave gained 144.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 26.3% rally.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Key DriversAccording to National Retail Federation (“NRF”) online retail sales will grow 8–12%, three times faster as compared with brick-and-mortar retail sales growth projection of 2.8% in 2017. Market research firm eMarketer estimates global retail eCommerce sales (excluding travel, restaurant and event ticket sales) to reach $1.915 trillion in 2016, accounting for 8.7% of total retail spending worldwide. This will further increase to $4.058 trillion by 2020, which will make up 14.6% of total retail spending. We believe that the massive growth in eCommerce spending bodes well for Shopify.The company’s cloud-based platform is well-positioned to address growing needs of merchants at a time when social media, cloud computing, mobile devices and data analytics are transforming the eCommerce market place.Shopify’s biggest USP lies in the fact that it is a brand oriented platform as compared with an online marketplace. Here, the brand hogs the limelight, which helps the merchant win customers much faster through focused interaction. The platform helps in improving customer’s brand loyalty, which drives merchant revenues. Further, we note that Shopify hosts a huge database of merchant and customer interactions. Merchants leverage this transactional dataset to get meaningful insight into the sales channel growth prospects and consumer behavioural aspects. This improves their ability to target prospective customers more easily, which drives sales growth.We believe that the company’s merchant focus strategy will aid it to dominate the SMB eCommerce market in the long run.Notably, more than 133K net new merchants began selling on Shopify during 2016. We anticipate this number to improve as newly added sales channels like Facebook Messenger and Amazon continues to attract new merchants. Shopify noted that the addition of Houzz, Wanelo, eBates and others has driven the number of channels over which a merchant can sell to more than a dozen. The company also noted that merchants are buying more apps through app store, which is positive. Shopify app store currently offers more than 1400 apps. Moreover, availability of Apple Pay and addition of Canada Post are some other notable developments that will boost merchant base.We believe that the company’s strong partner referral system will boost merchant base that will eventually drive top-line growth in the near term.Shopify has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 166.5%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 22%.Risk RemainsShopify is relatively a new player in the eCommerce marketplace. Although it is not a direct competitor to behemoths like Alibaba and Amazon, many of its customers are. Moreover, the company focuses on the SMB segment which is more susceptible to macro-economic headwinds. Both factors present significant risk for growth prospects.Zacks Rank and Key PicksShopifycurrently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), all of which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

116,DXC,"QuickLogic Corporation (QUIK  -  Free Report) shares surged about 7.5% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 23%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.2%.Will the recent positive trend continue driving the stock over the long haul or is it due for a pullback? Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the recent fundamentals and trends in order to get a better hold on the catalysts.Growth DriversLast quarter (third-quarter 2017), the company reported a loss of 4 cents per share, which was narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 6 cents per share. Revenues of $3 million also increased 6% on a year-over-year basis.Growing adoption of QuikLogic’s sensor processing solutions and embedded FPGA (eFPGA) Intellectual Property (“IP”) Licensing is a tailwind. The company’s new support center in Taiwan related to eFPGA IP has also helped in developing relationships with prospective customers, which can eventually lead to design wins.Further, the company’s initiatives for innovation-based expansion of the product portfolio are anticipated to be positive. Additionally, the newly added “barge-in” feature to enhance the company’s EOS S3 Sensor Processing Platform, is expected to boost the top line going ahead. This platform also has three new management positions for product management, hardware solutions architecture and system engineering to enable a focused development process.During the quarter, the company’s test-chip qualification for SMIC low power 40 nanometer process was completed. The enhancement of the product suite with this new technology is also expected to be a catalyst.In order to broaden presence in the Chinese market, QuickLogic signed a partnership agreement with a prominent EDA tool and semiconductor IP distributor in China named AcconSys. The latter will provide the company’s flagship ArcticPro embedded FPGA solutions with sales and support services in China. Management is also positive about its IP engagement funnel.The company is witnessing increasing demand for wearable products in the B2B market, primarily driven by higher demand from hospitals and fitness focused companies, which need to track body activities and biometric information.Bottom LineQuickLogic has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 9.2%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 20%.In our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksQuickLogiccurrently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), all of which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

117,DXC,"In the Global Week Ahead, it’s all about monetary policy.But this huge talking wave is NOT likely to wash ashore and be market-moving.Nearly all of what is about to happen has already been communicated. And well.Wednesday, the Fed becomes the leader. Here comes that 25 basis point hike.After that fait accompli, four western European central banks surf into global risk markets. They issue policy decisions starting Thursday. Expect none to alter their stances or offer meaningful market effects.Another four Latin American central banks get on their boards after the Fed — to offer their latest decisions for that region. Maybe Mexico gets interesting. But it is not likely.The FOMC meeting on Tuesday into Wednesday culminates in the policy statement at 2 pm ET, along with the Summary of Economic Projections.That summary includes the revised ‘dot plot’ of future rate projections.Any comment on weak U.S. Consumer Price Inflation (the CPI) will be closely watched, to see if there is any change to sentiment.I see penciled in 3 rate hikes for 2018, but 2 is another likely call.This will be Chair Yellen’s last press conference at the helm.  A 25 basis point hike in the Fed Funds rate, from 1.25% to 1.5% is in the cards from the meeting itself.The first order of business is to congratulate Chair Yellen. I agree with covering analyst sentiment. She deserved a second term after a fine performance and can go out with her head held high regarding the leadership she has provided.While she will be back to chair the January 31st 2018 meeting, that will be a statement only event, making this December meeting her last command performance.The Bank of England (BoE) is nearly universally expected by traders to leave policy unchanged at 0.5%.Governor Carney has already guided. A pair of rate hikes through to 2020 may be about the limit to this tightening cycle.His exact quote about a month ago was: “We’ll see how the economy evolves. If it evolves broadly in line with our projections we would probably raise interest rates a couple of times over the next few years.”Tuesday’s U.K. CPI report may further inform BoE policy risks. The expectation is for inflation to be topping out at about 3% and thereby averting the over-3 data that triggers the hand wringing by central bankers the world over.The European Central Bank (ECB) head Mario Draghi is also expected to jawbone while keeping his various ECB policy measures intact.Europe’s central bank is unlikely to be terribly exciting to watch for some time. It has already moved for extending bond purchases through to next September 2018 at a diminished pace — while guiding that rate hikes would follow much later.The ECB is likely to reduce its bond market portfolio reinvestment well after that — if it follows the Fed’s path of reinvesting.All of this will happen — until the ECB rate normalization process is well underway, in just a few years time.In other words, be patient.This global rate ‘normalization’ thing is going to take awhile.Top Zacks #1 Rank Stocks—For active stocks, I am watching info tech plays and mining closely.DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report): This is a $27 billion market-cap stock.

The buyout is aimed to provide a boost to CGI Group’s capabilities to serve customers better.Following the acquisition, CGI Group will gain consultancy facilities including research and development, along with manufacturing and enterprise support services.

121,DXC,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) unveiled a new TITAN V graphics processing unit (“GPU”) for the PCs at annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Long Beach, CA. The new TITAN V is built on the NVIDIA Volta architecture-based GPUs.The all new Titan V desktop for PCs is particularly targeted at machine learning and artificial intelligence (“AI”), an area where the company has worked hard in order to establish itself in this space in recent years.Notably, the stock has been clocking solid returns of 109.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of about 46.8%.What’s the Specialty?TITAN V is integrated on the new TSMC 12-nanometer FFN high-performance manufacturing process. The 12GB HBM2 video memory card offers enhanced graphics capabilities is likely to enthral gamers.Per the company, the new TITAN V which is built on 21.1 billion transistors is capable of delivering 110 teraflops of performance, which is more than 9x times more powerful compared with its predecessor, the Titan Xp, which was announced in April, this year. The all new GPU is immediately available priced at $2,999.With the launch of TITAN V, NVIDIA can maximize user experience by offering high performance computing (“HPC”) capabilities. Further, these GPUs are touted to be more energy efficient than the earlier versions. Consequently, the launch of this product will enable the company to increase customer base and also help in garnering additional revenues.We also believe that this launch will provide NVIDIAan edge against Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (AMD  -  Free Report), new Radeon RX Vega 56 and 64 graphics cards, which were released in August this year. In fact, this launch is a testimony to NVIDIA’s foray into the high-end graphics card market.PC Gaming and Graphics Card MarketPer Gartner, PC shipments declined 3.6% in the third quarter of 2017. However, growth of the high-end PC market that includes gaming PCs was better than expected.Per Jon Peddie Research (“JPR”), with an increase in the number of people engaging in PC gaming, the related hardware market is experiencing a huge boost. Per the research firm, the market exceeded $30 billion mark in 2016 and is anticipated to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% through 2019.Growth in the gaming hardware market is driving demand for graphics processors as well. Per Allied Market Research, the GPU market is anticipated to reach $157.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2016 to 2022.Per JPR, in third-quarter 2017, the graphics board shipments increased 29.1% sequentially and 21.5% year over year. NVIDIA continues to be a leader with 72.8% share, while AMD’s market share was 69.7%.We believe that the launch of the new graphics cards will help NVIDIA maintain its market share going forward.Bottom LineNVIDIA is the world’s biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs. The company’s efforts toward autonomous vehicle and the AI segment shows that it intends to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too. Furthermore, the company will be able to reduce dependency on the PC industry by expanding business avenues, which is currently declining.Given the accelerated momentum in gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe that this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a long-term EPS growth estimate of 10.3% will continue to rally.

124,DXC,"During the course of their financial planning and execution, while value investors miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks.Consequently, the quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) approach. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).The price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio is a perfect example of a GARP strategy. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report): The company develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes over-the-counter (OTC) consumer goods and pharmaceutical products worldwide. Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of B, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 9.6%.DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report): This is an independent, end-to-end IT services company, primarily providing information technology services and solutions in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

125,DXC,"While betting on a stock near its 52-week high, investors are faced with one of the trickiest questions — will the stock scale higher or are it the right time to book profits?Though betting on 52-week high stocks without a foolproof investment plan is perilous and even naïve, clubbing it with the correct parameters can turn the tide in investors’ favor.In this screening article, we discuss the 52-week investment plan. While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52-week high investment technique, many of them believe that 52-week high stocks which are still undervalued and have strong upside potential can be lucrative bets.52-Week High: A Good IndicatorStocks near 52-week highs often instill the presumptive “adjustment and anchoring bias” in the minds of investors. This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52-week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor.Many a times, such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers. Meanwhile, news pertaining to robust sales, surging profit levels, bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher.However, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52-week high bar. Wall Street’s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it.Also, recent academic research reveals that if a stock’s current price is near its 52-week high, there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period. According to researchers George and Hwang, holding 52-week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0.45% between 1963 and 2001. Encouragingly, this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum-based strategies.Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52-week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries. The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum.These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time. Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range and is likely to touch the 52-week high mark soon.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily.Here are five of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen:Daqo New Energy Corp. (DQ  -  Free Report) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of high-quality polysilicon to photovoltaic product manufacturers.

126,DXC,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) has priced its previously announced public offering of €1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The note carries an interest rate of 2.875% semi-annually. The notes will mature on Feb 1, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.  The company has filed for registration under the Securities Act of 1933.JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Citigroup C, BofA Merrill Lynch, MUFG and RBC Capital Markets are acting as joint book-running managers for the purpose. The offering is made under the company’s shelf registration statement.Proceeds from the OfferingEquinix, a global data center service provider,intends to use the net proceeds (approximately €986.7 million) from the planned offering, along with nearly $10 million of available cash, for repaying existing €995 million term loan due 2024.Notably, this will be the company’s third senior notes offering this year. Prior to this, Equinix had commenced offerings worth €1.0 billion in September and $1.25 billion in March.Factors in Favor of EquinixBorrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing elevated demand. We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth as well.Last quarter (third-quarter 2017), Equinix reported solid year-over-year improvement in revenues as well as earnings. This can primarily be attributed to strong booking activity, the company's global platform, continued enterprise momentum and synergies from acquisition.Equinix continues to witness strong demand for cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing their networks. The company observed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms provided a boost to the top line.The company has made 13 new expansion facilities across all three regions amounting to $615 million. Acquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. Worldwide, the company owns 190 IBX data centers across 48 markets and 24 countries.It is worth mentioning that, Equinix exited third-quarter 2017 with $1.629 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company's total debt principal outstanding was $10.12 billion as on Sep 30, 2017. Consequently, raising funds through this public offering will be beneficial for the company.Share PriceThe company’s share price movement has been quite favorable. In the past year, its shares have returned 33.9%, while the industry recorded growth of 15.3%.Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important components of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability, going forward.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. may affect product pricing, consequently denting the margins.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company. (DXC  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and DXC have a long-term expected growth rate of 11.2% and 10.5%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

(BR  -  Free Report) is expanding its strategic alliance with Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS). Consequently, this deal will enhance performance for customers. However, the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.The collaboration effort will help to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository.

Above all, AWS' cloud-based marketing solution will provide Broadridge a competitive advantage over peers.Share PriceIn the last one year, Broadridge’s share price increased 43.3%, outperforming the industry‘s growth of only 13.5%.Last WordsBroadridge is a leading global provider of technology-based outsourcing solutions to the financial services industry. The company offers a broad, integrated suite of innovative global solutions across the investment lifecycle along with a wide range of cost-effective and scalable solutions to the financial industry. The company’s systems lower clients’ capital investments in operations infrastructure, consequently allowing them to focus on core business activities.Strength of the company’s products and services, led by the Investor Communications business, allows it to navigate through the ongoing economic challenges.

128,DXC,"The bull market that started in 2009 is expected to go strong this year. This optimism largely stems from the Santa Claus rally, which is being felt way ahead of Christmas. This year’s holiday season started on a solid note as consumers have stepped up their online purchases. But, it’s the Senate Republican’s approval of the rewrite of the U.S. tax code that is likely to drive the equity market higher.Further, encouraging economic backdrop and higher consumer confidence in recent times also painted a rosy picture. Thus, it’s time to invest in solid stocks that are likely to make the most of the bullish sentiments.December: The Best Month for InvestorsHistorically, the month of December has been the best for the S&P 500 investors. While it has been the second best for the Dow and the Nasdaq, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks also tends to perform well starting mid-December going into January.The table shows December’s monthly return for the S&P 500 from 1964-2016:MonthAverage ReturnJan0.9%Feb0.1%Mar1.2%Apr1.5%May0.2%Jun0.0%Jul0.4%Aug-0.1%Sep-0.4%Oct1.0%Nov1.1%Dec1.4%(Source: Topdown Charts, Thomson Reuters)In fact, all the major indices more or less have yielded an average return of at least 1.8% in the final month of the year since 1987, per CNBC analysis using Kensho. This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year. This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader's Almanac.But, many market pundits have been using the term to refer to the period from the beginning of December, or even as early as Black Friday, to Christmas. And this time around, markets have gained on strong holiday sales and, there you have it, a Santa Claus rally. Consumers have also shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more. This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally.Santa Claus Rally Drives Holiday SalesAbout 174 million Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing the estimated 164 million, according to the National Retail Federation. Cyber Monday, in fact, registered the largest online shopping day in U.S. history. Online sales crossed the $6.6 billion mark by the end of the day, reflecting a rise of 16.8% from the same period last year.Lest we forget, around $5.03 billion was spent online on Black Friday, reflecting an uptick of 17% from last year. Small Business Saturday and Sunday (Nov 25 & 26) also recorded combined online sales of $5.12 billion, up 10% from the year-ago levels.Senate Passes Sweeping Tax Overhaul BillThe Senate voted 51-49 to approve the Republican tax bill. It’s a major policy change that will create big winners and help markets maintain the decade-long bull run.The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, marking the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates. Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget, tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.As the Senate approved the tax bill, small-cap stocks will also tend to surge. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Gearing Up for a Solid End to 2017: 5 BuysCourtesy of positive seasonal trend, solid holiday sales and Republicans’ approval of the nearly $1.5-trillion tax rewrite, we are lined up for a strong year-end rally. The economy had already seen the fastest growth in three years in the third quarter, which highlights its resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes.Hence, it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks in the market that can make the most of this bullish sentiment. Such stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.PVH Corp.

131,DXC,"A successful investor understands the importance of retaining well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals. Though there may be some concerns regarding the stock but they are all short-lived.Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. It has rallied 53.6% year to date, outperforming 36.9% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Upbeat Q4 ReultsContinuing its earnings streak for the seventh consecutive quarter, Synopsys, delivered stellar fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom line both came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 69 cents, which came in 10.4% higher than the year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings of 77 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 57 cents.The company’s fourth-quarter revenues jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million and came ahead of the previously guided range of $642-$657 million. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys’ products, along with strength in IP and hardware products. Notably, per the company “Our three-year backlog grew approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, reflecting very good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals.”Encouraging GuidanceThe company initiated positive guidance for the fiscal first quarter. The company expects revenues in the range of $740-$765 million (mid-point $752.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was pegged at $669.1 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 98 cents and $1.02 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85 cents.Positive Earnings Surprise HistorySynopsys has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 10.9%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 9.1%.ValuationMoreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Synopsys currently trades at a forward P/E of 24.18x as against the industry group average of 56.00xOther Growth DriversSynopsys recently announced the acquisition of Black Duck Software, a leader in automated solutions for securing and managing open source software. The addition of Black Duck's Software Composition Analysis solution will enhance Synopsys' product offering and will expand customer reach consequently boosting the top line.The company is a vendor of electronic design automation (“EDA”) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company’s recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable it to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to customers.Risk RemainsHowever, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Other Key PicksCurrently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company.

132,DXC,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks to the portfolio at the right time. Indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. It has rallied 61.9% year to date, outperforming 56.8% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at the moment. Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this stock an attractive investment option.Good ProjectionsThe company reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Oct 28, 2017) results. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 34 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Reported earnings were far better than the year-ago figure of 21 cents.Although Marvell’s revenues declined 1.2% year over year to $616.3 million, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $613 million.  Moreover, reported revenues came ahead of the mid-point of management guided range of $595-$625 million (mid-point $610 million).The company provided an encouraging forthcoming guidance. It also anticipates fourth-quarter 2018 revenues in the range of $595-$625 million (mid-point $610 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $595 million.The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 29-33 cents (mid-point 31 cents) while the Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 28 cents.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Marvell has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 10.1%. Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 14.6%.Other Growth Drivers: Though the macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put the financials under pressure in the near term, we believe that the strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products could be a catalyst. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of newly-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.In an effort to expand offerings beyond hard disk drives to high growth areas such as data centers and wireless communications, Marvell recently entered into an agreement to acquire Cavium. The buyout will provide the company an opportunity to expand offerings and access newer markets.Going forward, Marvell’s current restructuring initiative will help it improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are projected to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects sound financial position and favorable prospects.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader technology space are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company.

134,DXC,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Wix.com Ltd. (WIX  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in WIX.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 11 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 21 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 2 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Wix.comhas seen eight downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 16 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 18.8% in the past month.Wix.com Ltd.

135,DXC,"It is hard to ignore stocks that scale 52-week highs or hit the lows as such movements are tracked on a daily basis. But the question here is: what importance does such a stock movement hold from an investor’s perspective?In this screening article, we discuss the 52-week investment plan. One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook, this strategy relies on the mantra, “buy high and sell higher.” Betting on a stock near its 52-week high has its own pitfalls as there is a possibility of it scaling higher or going downhill without forewarning.While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52-week high investment technique, many of them believe that 52-week high stocks which are still undervalued and have strong upside potential can be lucrative bets.An Insight in to 52-Week High StocksStocks near 52-week highs often instill the presumptive “adjustment and anchoring bias” in the minds of investors. This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52-week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor.Many a times, such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers. Meanwhile, news pertaining to robust sales, surging profit levels, bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher.However, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52-week high bar. Wall Street’s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it.Also, recent academic research reveals that if a stock’s current price is near its 52-week high, there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period. According to researchers George and Hwang, holding 52-week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0.45% between 1963 and 2001. Encouragingly, this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum-based strategies.Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52-week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries. The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum.These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range and is likely to touch the 52-week high mark soon.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000 Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily.Here are seven of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen:Idaho-based Micron Technology, Inc.

136,DXC,"In the course of strict screening to determine the intrinsic value of a company, investors often miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. The same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks.If we keenly observe the investment track of the Oracle of Omaha, we can see how, in quest of eliminating these hazards, this pure play value investor has gradually shifted to a mixed  investment strategy or more precisely GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy.This strategy combines both growth and value investing principles and has a proven track record of success. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 33 stocks that qualified the screening:Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT  -  Free Report) – This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is a lifestyle retail chain and operates specialty retail stores in the United States. Boot Barn Holdings can be an impressive value investment pick with its Value Style Score of B. The company’s long-term expected earnings growth rate is projected to be 15.7%.Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report): The company develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes over-the-counter (OTC) consumer goods and pharmaceutical products worldwide. Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Style Score of B, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 9.6%.Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report): This is one of the largest producers of engineered wood products and plywood in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products. The stock has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 18.5%. The stock currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #1.

138,DXC,"Congress’s nonpartisan scorekeeper in tax matters, the Joint Committee on Taxation, declared that the House Republicans passed an overhaul of the U.S. tax code that slashes corporate tax rates on Thursday.Big banks will benefit immensely from the tax cut as this will likely bolster investments. Lower tax rates also drive after-tax earnings for tech behemoths as it leads to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and development, as well as mergers and acquisitions.Small-cap companies are poised to gain enormously as well, mostly because they have been paying more taxes than their counterparts. Thus, investors should focus on multinational financial and technology service providers, as well as small-cap players, that can make the most of the slashed corporate tax rate.Senate Passes Tax Bill House Republicans approved a monumental bill to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The bill cleared the House 227-205, without Democratic support. The Democrats believed that it is a give-away to the wealthiest Americans. 13 Republicans representing districts with an already high average state and local tax deduction also voted against the bill.Such a high tax deduction will be scaled back significantly under the House plan. Nevertheless, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that around 92% of Americans will pay less or the same taxes until 2023 under the new plan.Republicans, in the meantime, have been rooting for a change in tax codes for several years but have repeatedly failed to garner support in the House until Trump’s election. Trump said that such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families, while the White House press secretary said that “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”This has set the stage for Republicans to execute their ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses more competitive globally.Great for Banks & Tech CompaniesThe bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, making it the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates ever.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut  to 20%.Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Small Caps Rally on House VoteAfter the House passed the tax bill, small-cap stocks surged. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Moreover, Trump’s call for more protectionism and less global trade boosted small caps that mostly generate less than 20% of its revenues from overseas. In contrast, large-cap companies typically generate more than 30% of their sales from abroad.The Russell 2000 Index, which comprises the smallest companies in terms of market capitalization, is up more than 27% since Trump was elected, while the S&P Small Cap 600 Index climbed more than 25% since the close of trading on Nov 8.Top 5 WinnersInvestors should double down on the hottest banking and tech bigwigs, as well as solid companies with smaller market capitalizations.

139,DXC,"Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.On such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio, since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth, and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Screening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks – that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years – can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Here are the five of the 18 stocks that made it through the screen:Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report): Jones Lang LaSalle, founded in 1999, is a leading full-service real estate firm that provides corporate, financial and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users, and investors worldwide.

141,DXC,"Shares of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) rose more than 5%, in after-hours trading, as the company released better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Further, the company provided encouraging fiscal 2018 outlook, which positively impacted the share price.Notably, DXC Technology is result of the merger between Computer Sciences and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was concluded on Apr 1, 2017.The company reported non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.93 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 per share and also increased on a year-over-year basis.DXC Technology’s stock price history reveals that it hasn’t disappointed in a long time.

Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, on constant currency basis, revenues decreased 4.3% year over year. The decline was primarily due to completion of two large government contracts in the UK. Revenues from the new business for GBS came in at $2.5 billion during the quarter.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the quarter came in at $3.142 billion as compared with $836 million reported in the year-ago-quarter. On constant currency basis, revenues decreased 4.8% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting), primarily due to decline in traditional infrastructure services.

USPS revenue was up 5.5% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting).

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteOutlookThe company reiterated fiscal 2018 revenues guidance. For fiscal 2018, DXC Technology continues to expect revenues to be in the range of $24-$24.5 billion in constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.18 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is now anticipated to be in the range of $7.25-$7.75 per share (previous guidance $6.50-$7 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $6.84 per share.Recent activityDXC Technology recently announced the spin-off of its USPS business, and subsequently merged the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of March 2018.Per the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, consequently making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon conclusion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon the completion of its spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.Our TakeThe company reported stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, where in both top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for fiscal 2018.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe that the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which is likely drive growth over the long run. Further, the company is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive with companies like CACI International Inc. (CACI  -  Free Report)  and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain headwinds.Currently, DXC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

142,DXC,"We are in the last stretch of the Q3 earnings season, with 406 S&P 500 members or 85.4% of the index’s total membership having already reported their numbers, as of Nov 3, according to the latest Zacks Earnings Preview.Among the various sectors, Technology has emerged as one of the outperformers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 85% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index has already reported, as of Nov 3. According to the report, approximately 81.8% of the companies delivered positive earnings surprises, while 86.4% of the companies beat top-line expectations.Earnings of these companies are up 22.4% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, mainly driven by solid performance of tech heavyweights such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft and Intel.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Though the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How DXC, CSRA, SNAP and SINA are PlacedThe end-to-end IT services provider DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results tomorrow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues are pegged at $1.53 per share and $5.99 billion respectively. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figures, indicate remarkable growth of 150.7% for earnings and 220.3% for revenues. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DXC Technology’s Q2 results are likely to benefit from the Computer Sciences Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent. (Read: Merger, Partnerships & Acquisitions to Drive DXC Q2 Earnings)DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteLet’s take a sneak peek at CSRA Inc.  which is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.  We expect the company to deliver strong results driven by frequent contract wins, solid backlog, improving federal spending environment and revenue visibility. Moreover, CSRA has been benefiting from its domain expertise and strong partnership base that includes the likes of ServiceNow, Microsoft and Red Hat among others. The small tuck-in acquisition of NES is anticipated to boost the company’s ability to win contracts. (Read: CSRA's Q2 Earnings to Gain From Contract Wins, Solid Backlog)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $1.27 billion for the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 47 cents. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).CSRA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CSRA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CSRA Inc. QuoteAnother tech company, Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) is also set to report third-quarter 2017 results. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.It should be noted that the company’s growth prospect depends on two key factors — user base growth and ad revenues. It is most likely that the company’s third-quarter results will follow the previous quarter’s trend, in which though it registered year-over-year increase in user base and ad revenues, rate of growth witnessed a declining trend. Also, the slash in 2017 U.S. ad revenue estimates for Snapchat by market research firm, eMarketer, doesn’t bode well for the company. (Read: Snap to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Snap Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Snap Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Snap Inc. QuoteSINA Corporation (SINA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter  results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues are pegged at 73 cents and $409.8 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 30.4% and 49.1%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.Analysts covering the stock expect SINA's quarterly results to be driven by an increase in user base and monetization efforts. SINA’s user base has been increasing driven by growth in the number of mobile users. According to CNNIC report, mobile users in China accounted for 96.4% of total 751 million Internet users as of August 2017. We believe SINA’s popular mobile portal and service offerings will enable the company to capitalize on the growing mobile market.Nonetheless, some headwinds with regard to obtaining new media rights for sports in China may limit its top-line growth. In addition to this, the company faces tougher year-over-year comparison. In third-quarter 2016, the company’s revenues were largely driven by Olympic Games.

143,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.53, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 150.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $5.99 billion, up 220.3% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise  DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteDXC Technology’s fiscal second-quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Merger Opens Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company had registered a 206% surge in fiscal first-quarter revenues mainly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal second-quarter top-line performance as well.Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead, the company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid fiscal second-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP as well. These alliances have increased its access to new technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Also, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Acquisition to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions — Tribridge and Logicalis SMC. While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July this year, Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process.Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology. Therefore, the buyout is likely to benefit the company’s to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Escalating Interest Costs to Weigh on ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. As of Jun 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.25 billion, while it paid $76 million as interest expenses during the fiscal first quarter, which was 200% higher than the year-ago quarter tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt has significantly increased this year. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

144,DXC,"Unisys Corporation (UIS  -  Free Report) incurred third-quarter 2017 GAAP loss of $41.1 million or loss of 81 cents per share compared with loss of $28.2 million or loss of 56 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The deterioration was primarily due to a decline in revenues. The reported loss was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents.Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $21 million or 29 cents per share compared with $29.9 million or 41 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Unisys Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unisys Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unisys Corporation QuoteInside the HeadlinesTotal revenues declined 2.5% year over year to $666.3 million primarily due to lower revenues from the Services segment. Reported revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $635 million.New business TCV (total contract value) increased 38% year over year to $214 million. Total TCV of $624 million for the quarter was down 44% year over year, largely due to a large 12-year contract signed in third-quarter 2016. The company’s Services backlog was up 1% sequentially to $3.7 billion. New business pipeline grew 18% year over year to $9.6 billion while total sales pipeline improved 22% to $12.3 billion. Total non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.3%, up 60 basis points (bps) year over year. EBITDA for the quarter decreased to $11.6 million from $28.5 million in the prior-year quarter while adjusted EBITDA improved marginally to $88.6 million from $87.3 million for the respective periods.  Segmental PerformanceRevenues from the Services segment came in at $575.5 million, down 4.2% year over year. Services operating margin was 3%, up 60 bps year over year. The Technology segment’s revenues improved to $90.8 million from $82.4 million in the year-earlier quarter. Technology operating margin came in at 31% compared with 32% in the year-ago period due to higher sales of low margin hardware and third-party products.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2017, Unisys had $598.7 million in cash and cash equivalents with long-term debt of $631.5 million. The company entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility to replace the existing one, which was scheduled to mature in June 2018. Unisys also reduced future pension funding exposure in European pension plans, including freezing the last significant open defined benefit plan.For the first nine months of 2017, the company utilized $36.3 million cash compared with operating cash flow of $103 million in the year-ago period, resulting in adjusted free cash utilization of $5 million compared with adjusted free cash flow of $162.5 million for the respective periods.OutlookUnisys reaffirmed its guidance for full-year 2017. The company continues to expect revenues in the range of $2.65-$2.75 billion and adjusted free cash flow in the of $130-$170 million range. Non-GAAP operating profit margin is expected to be between of 7.25% and 8.25%.Unisys has been restructuring its business to improve profitability. This restructuring strategy includes lowering headcount, selling non-core businesses and revamping its sales strategy while investing in a few higher-growth areas such as outsourcing. We expect the company to continue with its cost-control initiatives and put greater effort toward sales growth, as it strives to overcome operational weaknesses. Notably, during the reported quarter, the company inked several contracts. All these deals are likely to propel top-line growth in the coming quarters.Unisys currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are CDK Global, Inc. (CDK  -  Free Report), CDW Corporation (CDW  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

145,DXC,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 12 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings once last year. In third-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive streak, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%.The bottom-line figure fared much better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 12.7% from the prior-year quarter tally of $1.57. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company’s efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 7% year over year to $566 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.6 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 6% year over year) and the bio/pharmaceutical end market (up 7% year over year). The momentum was further backed by 15% growth in the government and academic markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales climbed 8% and 6%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Asia and Europe, which posted 7% and 20% growth, respectively. However, sales in the Americas continued to reflect weakness and remained flat year over year.Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at $135.2 million, up from $123.9 million incurred in third-quarter 2016. Research and development outlay for the quarter was $33.8 million compared with $30.4 million incurred a year ago.Despite the rise in these expenses, operating income in the quarter climbed 4.8% year over year to $159 million.Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteLiquidityWaters Corp.’s cash, cash equivalents and investments at the quarter end amounted to $3.3 billion, higher than the $2.81 billion recorded as on Dec 31, 2016. The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $2.53 billion from $2.36 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business started 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum, going ahead. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business in the near future.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader sector include MAM Software Group, Inc. (MAMS  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. (MTD  -  Free Report). While MAM Software and DXC Technology sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Mettler-Toledo holds the same rank as Waters Corp. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.MAM Software has an outstanding positive average earnings surprise of 104.2% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.DXC Technology also has a robust earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 25.7% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates each time.Mettler-Toledo has a striking earnings surprise history for the last four quarters, having beaten estimates all through, for an average beat of 5.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

146,DXC,"President Trump’s plans of massive tax cuts and reforms cleared a critical hurdle with the Senate passing a budget blueprint of trillions of dollars for fiscal 2018. This has paved the way for the Republicans to pursue the much awaited tax-cut reform without Democratic support. After all, both American households and corporates have borne the burden of an unfair tax code for quite some time.The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates will put more money in individual’s pockets, while it will be a shot in the arm for financial as well as tech majors that have parked a lot of cash overseas. The cash held overseas will be brought back to avail the lower domestic rate, prompting a slew of new deals. This in turn will fuel innovation, organic growth and earnings.Repatriation of billions of dollars also strengthens the economy causing the federal funds rate to move north, which bodes well for both banking and non-banking financial organizations. Thus, let us invest in multinational financial and information technology service providers, as well as computer makers that can make the most from the lowering of corporate tax rate.Senate Republicans Push Through Budget ProposalSenate Republicans successfully passed a $4-trillion budget blueprint in federal outlays by a 51-to-49 vote. The Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget measure, with GOP senator Rand Paul of Kentucky voting against it. This has set the stage for Republicans to begin ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code as early as this year, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses globally more competitive.After repeatedly failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, the GOP lawmakers were under tremendous pressure to deliver on tax reforms that they had promised in the election campaign. The Senate’s passage of the budget blueprint has unlocked a special parliamentary procedure that will help Republicans cut $1.5 trillion in taxes with just 50 votes. A typical Senate procedure requires 60 votes to bypass the threat of a filibuster.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell supported the budget and said that it was “critical to getting tax reform done;” while President Trump added that it is “an important step in advancing the Administration’s pro-growth and pro-jobs legislative agenda.”President Trump, in the meantime, had a tough message for House Republicans. They need to work on the tax reform and pass the Senate’s budget this week or face bloodbath next year. House Speaker Paul Ryan had already told his members that he wants tax reform enacted by this year, and approving the revised Senate budget this week gives the best shot to get it done within that timeframe.Banks Set to Gain From Trump’s Sweeping Tax CutsIt’s no wonder that bank’s profitability will be enhanced by the proposed tax cuts. The corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%.The slashing of domestic tax rate will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This will, ultimately, boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Non-banking financial institutions including insurance companies, asset managers and brokerage firms should also benefit. Rising rates act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should gain from a higher rate environment.Brokerage firms and asset managers also advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions From Trump’s Tax Plan Tax cuts will make tech majors bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will encourage such companies to carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Oracle Corporation hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.Top 5 GainersBanking on such positives, investing in sound multinational companies from the aforesaid sectors will be a prudent choice. We have, thus, selected five companies that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

147,DXC,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) has been a favorite among investors, courtesy of its strategic deals, spin-off initiatives and senior notes offerings. Shares of DXC Technology have gained 53.9% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the 30.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Strategic Deal Yield FavorablyDXC Technology recently announced entering into an agreement with Logicalis Group to buy the latter’s service management consultancy operation — Logicalis SMC.Logicalis SMC is one of the biggest integrator of ServiceNow Inc.’s (NOW  -  Free Report) software and solutions, a primary reason behind DXC Technology’s move. The integration of Logicalis SMC business will fortify DXC Technology’s position as a leading global software integrator for ServiceNow. The acquisition will help the company expand presence across Europe. Further, it will strengthen its “scale, reach, industry experience and skills portfolio in the fast-growing enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.”Going forward, the company acquired privately-held Tribridge in July. The company is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Dynamics 365, which explains why this buyout makes sense for DXC Technology.These buyouts have aided the company to enhance its portfolio, which is likely drive growth over the long run.Apart from buyouts, the company expanded ties with VMware at VMworld 2017. The two entities are coming together to debut the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next generation hybrid cloud platform. This contract will enable DXC Technology’s clients to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on the Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver enhanced performance for networking customers.VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space. With such partnership, DXC is well poised to benefit from the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions and offer an efficient and improved hybrid IT environment to drive performance.The Spin-OffLast week, DXC Technology announced the spin-off of its U.S. Public Sector (USPS) business, and subsequently merging the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital.Initially, the new company will have a total workforce of over 14,000 and generate annual revenues of approximately $4.3 billion. Per the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, consequently making the entire transaction tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon the completion of its spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.Moreover, in the last reported quarter (first-quarter of fiscal 2018) revenues from USPS segment were $677 million, down 3.5% year over year. Consequently, spinning off this segment can be deemed as a wise decision on the company’s part.Per the company, the IT services market for both commercial and the U.S. public sectors has been evolving at an accelerating pace. Therefore, DXC Technology’s latest spin-merger move is believed to provide it a customized approach toward handling two different types of clients. Upon the successful formation, the new company will become one of the top five IT services providers to the U.S. government.The reinforced capabilities will help the new company win government contracts, in turn bringing in more revenues, in our opinion.Senior Notes OfferingsDXC Technology had also announced the pricing of a Senior Floating Rate Notes offering worth $650 million. Notes, carrying an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.95% per year, are set to mature in 2021. The company intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which also include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing high demand. We believe that these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.Wrapping UpDXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which was concluded on Apr 1, 2017.The company noted that the merger has opened up new avenues of growth and will help the combined entity to become a leading player in the IT services domain. Post-merger, DXC Technology became the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc.Owing to such upsides, the stock has a long-term growth rate of 8% and a VGM Score of A.DXC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

148,DXC,"The Zacks Computer – IT Services industry comprises an array of companies with diversified end-markets and customer base.The industry includes consultancy, customer relationship management (CRM), communications, IT management & operations, cloud-based web development platform professional information solution, and outsourcing service providers.Increasing U.S. protectionism is hurting growth prospects of this industry. Lack of skilled workers particularly from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields in the United States has been bothering industry participants for quite some time.Moreover, the U.S. government’s plan to reduce the issuance of H1-B visas to foreign nationals particularly from countries like India is a key concern for this industry.Further, the ongoing trade war between the United States and China has created an uncertain environment that is not conducive for investments, particularly on infrastructure related services.Further, volatility in foreign exchange primarily due to current macro-economic scenario and headwinds in the emerging markets does not bode well for the Zacks Computer – IT Services Industry.Industry Comparison With S&P 500 & SectorThe Zacks Computer – IT Services Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector in the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 53.9%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 17.6% and 22.1%, respectively.The outperformance can be attributed to the ongoing digital transition, which is increasing demand for IT service solutions. Robust adoption of technologies, which enhance the digital workplace such as work-stream collaboration, workforce analytics and video message oriented middleware (MOM); security (endpoint detection and response), analytics (smart data discovery) and storage (in-memory data grids), is driving growth.One-Year Price PerformanceComputer – IT Services Stocks Appear Pretty ExpensiveSince there has been an exponential surge in debt level since 2015, it makes sense to value the industry based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because this valuation metric takes into account the level of debt.For capital-intensive companies, the EV/EBITDA is a preferable valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.Owing to the overall industry outperformance in the past year, the valuation is really expensive now. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.7X, which is marginally below the high of 16.2X in the past year but well above the median level of 14.8X. Clearly, the aggregate valuation picture for the space appears rich.The space also looks quite pricey when compared to the market at large as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.5X and the median level is 11.4X.Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM)Moreover, a comparison of the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.9X and the median level of 10.9X for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer IT Services Industry’s respective ratios.Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM)The premium to the broader market expanded materially in early 2018, as evident in the chart above, and is rising since then. The industry also trades at a premium to the broader sector on other conventional valuation metrics, for instance P/B.Dim Earnings Outlook Keeps Us CautiousEscalating operational expenses, soaring debt levels, increasing foreign exchange volatility and moderate spending are expected to hurt shareholder returns in the near term.However, what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it and the industry's aggregate stock market performance.Price and Consensus: Zacks Computer – IT Services IndustryThis becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend.

149,DXC,"Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) will be selling its wholly owned subsidiary Molina Medicaid Solutions (“MMS”), a Medicaid management information systems business, to DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report).MMS provides services to state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs including business processing, information technology development and administrative services.The unit was acquired by Molina Healthcare in 2010 from Unisys Corporation. It  represented 1% of company revenues in 2017 and also carried a service margin ratio of 8%.The sale expected to close during the third quarter of 2018, will fetch the company approximately $220 million. Funds from this deal will be invested in growing the company’s core business — Medicaid and Medicare. The company might also use part of the funds to pay debt, which will delever its balance sheet and strengthen its capital position.Though the sale might dilute the company’s 2018 earnings, its effect will be nullified from the increased buyback the company would make from the released funds from the sale.The sale came as no surprise and  is one of the numerous efforts that management is making to build up the company’s profitability that should help it in the long term.  Another positive news for the stock is the receipt of Medicaid contract for two regions in Florida following the protest against initial awards. Molina Healthcare currently serves around 105,000 lives, grossing nearly $550 million of annual revenues from these regions.Molina Healthcare primarily serves via Medicaid, Medicare and other government-sponsored programs.

The stock should derive a further impetus as it is showing marked changes from the recently undertaken transformation initiatives. New leadership, cost-cutting efforts, profit improvement initiatives as well as a focus on improving efficiency of core operating processes, should aid the company’s results. Molina Healthcare’s impressive first-quarter results, beating estimates by 111.11%, and a raised 2018 guidance bear evidence of early success achieved on its transformational plans.Moreover, the company recently disclosed in detail its progress on turnaround initiatives, reflecting its solid position for growth.Molina Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
