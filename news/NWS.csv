0,NWS,"Content, especially sports, looms as a game-changer as Google (GOOG) jumps into the pay-TV business.
"
1,NWS,"Google is ramping up high-speed Internet and TV service in Kansas City, where Time Warner Cable (TWC) is the biggest incumbent service provider.
"
2,NWS,"In Kansas City, Google has built an advanced fiber-optic network, capable of delivering a gigabit-per-second broadband service to homes, 100 times faster than what most U.S. households get.
"
3,NWS,"Google said in a corporate blog on Sunday that 180 out of 202 Kansas City neighborhoods, what it calls ""fiberhoods,"" are eligible to get its services.
"
4,NWS,"Analysts estimate some 24,000 city residents pre-registered with Google for its service, after a push by community groups. Consumers put down a $10 deposit to register. Google says it will extend its network first to neighborhoods with the highest percentage of homes pre-registered for service.
"
5,NWS,"But Google still faces a big challenge acquiring TV content that's competitive with the fare offered by Time Warner Cable and other local pay-TV providers, such as AT&T (T), analysts say.
"
6,NWS,"Google's TV lineup initially included channels from Viacom (VIA), Discovery (DISCA), Starz and NBC Universal, controlled by Comcast (CMCSA). It has yet to hammer out deals with Time Warner (TWX), Walt Disney (DIS) or News Corp. (NWS).
"
7,NWS,"Has NFL, Not ESPN
"
8,NWS,"Google has been maneuvering to add content. Google struck a deal last week with the National Football League to carry its two cable channels in Kansas City.
"
9,NWS,"Time Warner Cable doesn't offer the NFL-owned channels to subscribers, though it has other sports and football content, including Disney's ESPN.
"
10,NWS,"""Google's programming offerings leave many gaps, but carrying the NFL Network is one way to differentiate from Time Warner Cable,"" said Vijay Jayant, an analyst at ISI Group.
"
11,NWS,"He says Google's entry into Kansas City isn't a serious threat to Time Warner Cable, because the cable firm has only about 100,000 subscribers there, or less than 1% of its U.S. customer base.
"
12,NWS,"Still, analysts say Google could expand its pay-TV business to other cities if it succeeds in Kansas City.
"
13,NWS,"Google might extend its services to one or two more markets in 2013 and then increase ""at the rate of two to three per year for the next several years,"" said Adarsh Krishnan, an analyst at ABI Research.
"
14,NWS,"Observers say Google plans to expand its network to three small cities near Kansas City, but the Internet search leader hasn't revealed its strategy.
"
15,NWS,"Analysts say Google faces hurdles turning a profit. Google plans to charge $120 per month for Internet and TV services. If consumers buy both, it waives a $300 installation fee.
"
16,NWS,"As perks, consumers get a Google Nexus 7 tablet computer to be used as a TV remote and online file-storage space.
"
17,NWS,"Google could pressure cable and phone companies even if it doesn't emerge as a big player in pay-TV and broadband by disrupting business models. ""Internet usage is not capped, and there are no overages,"" market research firm SNL Kagan said in a report.
"
18,NWS,"Time Warner Cable is testing usage-based pricing in parts of Texas, where it has a 5-gigabyte cap on monthly data consumption before overage charges kick in.
"
19,NWS,"But content might determine Google TV's fate, analysts say.
"
20,NWS,"Without deals with Time Warner, Disney and News Corp., Google won't have HBO, Showtime and other popular channels.
"
21,NWS,"""It appears Google TV will not include TNT, CNN, ESPN and Fox Sports, to name just a few,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan.
"
22,NWS,"Acquiring sports content is the fastest-rising programming cost for cable TV firms. Disney's ESPN garners $4.76 per subscriber monthly on average in programming fees from cable firms, says SNL Kagan.
"
23,NWS,"Google's TV service will offer advanced search capability, allowing viewers to look for movies and shows on Hulu, Netflix (NFLX) and YouTube. Google's ownership of YouTube gives it another ace-in-the-hole.

46,NWS,"Users of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google who subscribe to newspapers will find articles from those publications appearing higher in their search results, part of the tech giant's efforts to help media companies find and retain paying readers, sources told Bloomberg Wednesday.Google also will begin sharing search data that show who's most likely to buy a subscription, said people familiar with the matter who asked to be anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Google executives plan to disclose specific details at an event in New York on March 20, the sources said. Google declined to comment.The moves could help publishers better target potential digital subscribers and keep the ones they've already got by highlighting stories from the outlets for which they're paying. The initiative marks the latest olive branch from Silicon Valley in its evolving relationship with media companies.Several publishers, including News Corp.'s (NWS) Wall Street Journal, the New York Times (NYT) and the Washington Post — the latter of which is owned by Amazon.com (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos — are focusing on getting readers to pay for their content as it becomes more difficult to support newsrooms with advertising revenue. Many have been pushing Google and social media outlet Facebook (FB) for new tools to drive subscriptions, arguing they should help support trusted journalism at a time when their platforms have been exploited to publish fake news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook recently made major changes to its News Feed algorithm that are expected to shrink publishers' online audiences. But it's helping publishers in other ways. In October, the company began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles, letting publishers process payments directly and keep all of the revenue. In February, Facebook announced a program to help metro papers build subscriptions.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, bought Texture, a digital magazine service, this week in what the company said was a sign that it's committed to supporting quality journalism.Last year, Google changed its ""First Click Free"" policy that led some media outlets with strict online paywalls to appear lower in search results. Now, instead of requiring publishers with paywalls to provide at least three free articles per day, media companies can decide how many articles to let Google users read without paying.While tech giants try to forge closer business ties with media outlets, the revenue flowing to publishers remains relatively small. Facebook and Google, which also owns YouTube, represent just 5% of publishers' total digital revenue, according to Digital Content Next, a trade group representing the Financial Times, Bloomberg News, New York Times and other publishers.Google's AMP program, which hosts articles on its servers instead of publishers' websites so they load faster, has won praise for helping drive more subscriptions, but ""revenue has been slow to build,"" the group said in a January report.Alphabet shares were up 1.4% near 1,156 in afternoon trades on the stock market today.

47,NWS,"Blackstone Group (BX), the private equity giant led by Stephen Schwarzman, is considering its biggest foray yet into the $27 billion-a-year industry for financial information.X The firm is in talks to buy a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' (TRI) largest unit, which supplies data and analytical tools to financial professionals, a person familiar with the matter said. Thomson Reuters, controlled by one of Canada's richest families, would cede its flagship Eikon terminal business while keeping the news operations, as well as ownership of its legal, tax and accounting arm.The division is worth about $20 billion, the person said, meaning any purchase would be one of the largest transactions in the industry since Thomson took over Reuters in 2008. Should it go ahead, Blackstone would compete directly with Bloomberg LP and News Corp.'s (NWS) Dow Jones division in selling financial services and trading tools.""For Blackstone, the simple attraction is fairly clear,"" said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities Ltd. in London, pointing to the high proportion of recurring subscription-based revenue at the financial and risk unit.While the talks are advanced, they may or may not lead to a deal, Toronto-based Thomson Reuters said in a statement late Monday. The board of Thomson Reuters is expected to meet Tuesday to discuss the deal, Reuters reported earlier.Blackstone already owns the financial-technology firm Ipreo Holdings LLC, which it purchased together with Goldman Sachs (GS). for $975 million in 2014. Blackstone declined to comment.The Thomson Reuters financial and risk unit, which also sells regulatory and risk management solutions to customers, got 77% of its $6.1 billion in revenue in 2016 from subscriptions to its products and 15% from transaction fees. The news service is expected to continue to supply Eikon and other products, according to a report by Reuters.Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news, data and information to the financial industry. Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, is a non-executive director at Blackstone.Bloomberg had a 33.4% market share, according to 2016 data, compared with 23.1% for Thomson Reuters, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC.A deal would force Thomson Reuters to consider the future of the loss-making unit where the news business resides, which it already reports separately from the financial and risk unit that drives more than half of earnings. The corporate division, including news, reported a $321 million loss in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2016.Thomson Reuters shares have retreated since October after third-quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates. The company has a current market value of $30.8 billion. Chief Executive Officer James C. Smith attributed that shortfall to potential customers delaying decisions amid regulatory changes resulting from the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II.In 2012, Thomson Reuters sold its healthcare unit, which provided data and analysis to hospitals, government agencies and employers, to Veritas Capital for $1.25 billion. In 2016, it offloaded its intellectual property and science division to Onex Corp. and Baring Private Equity Asia for $3.55 billion.The division for sale makes up about half of the company's profit. Any transaction would add to the $105 billion of private-equity deals targeting the media and technology industries over the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Thomson Reuters is controlled by Woodbridge Co., an Ontario, Canada-based holding company that manages the assets of the Thomson family. According to a regulatory filing last month, Woodbridge holds 63.6% of Thomson Reuters shares. The Thomsons, descended from company founder Roy Thomson, remain some of the richest people in Canada.

50,NWS,"Walt Disney (DIS) may announce a deal as soon as this week to acquire a large piece of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), according to a person familiar with the matter, transferring legendary Hollywood properties to new owners.Meanwhile, it was reported late Monday that Comcast (CMCSA) has formally dropped out of the bidding.A trust belonging to Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his family would end up with a small stake in Disney in the transaction, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Disney would acquire Fox's movie and TV studio, networks including FX and National Geographic, and international assets including Star India's TV channels and a 39% stake in European satellite provider Sky. Disney would also get Fox's stake in U.S. streaming-video provider Hulu, doubling its ownership to 60%.21st Century Fox would keep Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1. The company would remain independent at least initially, though it could consider a merger later with the Murdochs' publishing company, News Corp. (NWS), the person said. Fox Chief Executive Officer James Murdoch is likely to be offered a senior position at Disney after the transaction closes, the person said. That would put him in the running as a candidate to eventually succeed Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger.The talks between Disney and Fox, which began more than two months ago, will unite two giants of the entertainment industry and mark a significant turning point for Rupert Murdoch, the mogul who has spent the past seven decades assembling a media empire. A deal will still face regulatory scrutiny in Washington, where the U.S. Justice Department has sued to block another proposed media megamerger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX).A deal still hasn't been finalized, and the talks could fall apart. Fox shares rose 1.1% to 33.66 at the close. Burbank, Calif.-based Disney climbed 2.5% to 106.83.Disney had been competing against Comcast for the Fox assets, but Comcast reportedly dropped out of the bidding late Monday, Reuters reported.""When a set of assets like Fox's becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders. That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer,"" Comcast told Reuters in a prepared statement.Also, Verizon Communications (VZ) and Sony (SNE) have also explored the idea of acquiring the holdings.Fox's studio would give Disney the rights to popular characters such as the X-Men and the Simpsons, and could let the company cut costs by combining two giant Hollywood operations. The Sky stake would give Disney 22.5 million customers in five countries in Europe, with leading advertising technology, and Disney would be likely to seek full control of the satellite provider.Assuming Disney acquires the Fox assets in a stock-based deal, Fox shareholders would end up with about 25% of Disney, according to Rosenblatt Securities Inc. The Murdoch family trust holds an economic interest of about 16% in New York-based Fox, which would translate to a stake of roughly 5% in Disney, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.With speculation mounting that a deal was in the works, the Murdochs — Rupert and his sons Lachlan and James — sent a memo to employees late last week.""We want to address the headlines about us possibly talking to other companies about a potential transaction,"" the Murdochs said in the Dec. 7 email. ""While we can't comment on market speculation, we do want to address the impact we know this is having on all of you. Uncertainty always breeds unease. In every way, our focus is on our businesses and on the welfare of all our colleagues.""

55,NWS,"Research firm Nielsen found that 34% of Americans have used social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter to complain about a product, company or brand.
"
56,NWS,"""In 2010, the number of comments individuals posted about companies on social networking sites was larger than the number of email messages they sent,"" said Ken Landoline, an analyst at research firm Current Analysis.
"
57,NWS,"Thus, businesses want to monitor this continuous social media chatter. Vendors have responded by delivering more than 100 monitoring services and products.
"
58,NWS,"Ignoring social media conversations is no longer an option for a business. Not only is online chatter widespread, but its impact can be immediate. A marketer can leave for lunch without a care and return to find the company being lambasted by thousands of Facebook users. It's imperative for companies to know what's being said, and respond quickly to protect the brand.
"
59,NWS,"That's possible to do, thanks to products and services that can identify conversations about company brands, products or executives by monitoring comments in blogs, forums and social media sites. The products range from free to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"
60,NWS,"Many companies now typically monitor online mentions of their brands, products and executives. Monitoring this can be as simple as applying keyword searches that collect the mentions and forward them to the proper person for possible follow-up.

Passively run U.S. stock index funds outperformed, gaining 2.99%.A lot of the rough sledding occurred in late winter-early spring.

367,NWS,"When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences hands out its coveted Oscar for best picture on Sunday, odds are the 6,500-plus members will anoint a film that fits the mold of recent honorees — smallish and artsy.Gone are the days when megahits such as ""Titanic"" or ""Lord of The Rings"" — films that emanated from media giants News Corp. (NWS) and Time Warner (TWX) — win best picture.Today, the prize is more likely to go to a smaller-budget film with limited exposure outside of big cities like New York and Los Angeles. This year's nine hopefuls averaged $54 million in domestic ticket sales before their nominations were announced, according to ComScore Inc., not enough to rank in the top 50 for the year.While the Academy doubled the number of possible nominees to 10 in 2010 to make room for box-office hits, the appeal of the slate has dwindled over the years. That suggests members more than ever are emphasizing creativity over financial success. In 2015, the year ""Birdman"" won, the eight films vying for best picture had taken in an average of $25.6 million before their nominations, a recent low. When ""Titanic"" won in 1998, the pre-nominations average of the five contenders was $96.2 million.""La La Land,"" a musical about lovers struggling to succeed in show business, and ""Hidden Figures,"" about the contributions of three African American women to the early space program, have been the breakout pictures among this year's nominees. If either captures the Oscar, they would rank among the most successful in a decade.""Hidden Figures,"" from 21st Century Fox (FOX), has the largest domestic haul among the nominees at $144.5 million as of last weekend, according to ComScore. It's the third favorite to win at 50-to-1, according to awards tracker GoldDerby.com.""La La Land"" is the clear favorite, at 2-to-11. The film from Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA) (LGFB) has the second-biggest tally domestically at $134.6 million and is the leader globally at $340.5 million. It's also still rolling up sales, with a Feb. 14 release in China and expanded play in the U.S. on Imax's (IMAX) big screens.The second favorite for top prize at 18-to-1 is Barry Jenkins's coming-of-age feature ""Moonlight,"" distributed by independent firm A24. If that picture wins, its $22 million in domestic sales would mark the smallest total since ""The Hurt Locker"" in 2010.Recent data suggest the financial benefit of an Oscar nomination has also waned, probably because the pictures themselves lacked wide appeal. Still, some studios have managed to maximize the opportunity. ""American Sniper"" from Time Warner's Warner Bros.' unit generated 99% of its $350 million in North American ticket sales after being nominated for best picture.Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore, said the nominee with most to gain from a win this year is ""Lion,"" from independent studio Weinstein Co. about a lost Indian boy who is adopted by an Australian couple. The film was the last of the best-picture nominees to gain wide release. It's an 80 to 1 shot at GoldDerby.The studios with most to celebrate at this year's awards have seen better days commercially. Lions Gate has struggled to develop big films with the appeal of earlier successes like ""The Hunger Games"" and the ""Twilight"" series, yet garnered the most Oscar nominations of any distributor with ""La La Land,"" the World War II drama ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and ""Hell or High Water,"" a crime thriller set in modern-day west Texas.Viacom's (VIA) (VIAB) Paramount Pictures had the second-most nominations because of two best-picture hopefuls, ""Arrival"" and ""Fences."" Yet Viacom replaced studio chief Brad Grey on Wednesday because of losses and is seeking a successor.

368,NWS,"No. 1 online real estate site Zillow Group (ZG) reported Q4 earnings after the close Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations, as the company whose brands include Zillow, Trulia and Naked Apartments swung to a profit ex items. Analysts say rising interest rates could cool a hot housing market that some say has been a housing bubble, but others expect a smoother transition to slightly rising interest rates.Wall Street Q4 estimates: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share minus items of 11 cents, vs. a penny loss in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is expected to rise 31% to $222.3 million, its biggest rise in three quarters.Wall Street Q1 estimates: Analysts see EPS ex items of 6 cents, vs. a 13-cent loss in Q1 2016. Revenue is expected to rise 27% to $235.9 million.Q4 results, Q1 guidance: Zillow said Q4 sales rose 34% to $227.6 million, with EPS ex items of 14 cents. It said unique visitors among its properties rose 13% to more than 140 million. It reported adjusted EBITDA of $54.7 million, 24% of revenue. For Q1, it sees sales of $232 million-$237 million.Company Q4 guidance: Zillow three months ago guided to Q4 revenue of $218 million-$223 million, up 30% at the midpoint. The company also forecast adjusted pro former EDITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $96.1 million to $101.1 million. That excludes $130 million in last year's litigation settlement with News Corp.'s (NWS) Move Inc., owner of top rival Realtor.com. The two had been in protracted litigation involving trade secrets.Q3 results: Zillow reported EPS ex items of 17 cents, up 240% from 5 cents, on revenue of $224.6 million, up 35%. It reported adjusted EBITDA of $59.5 million, representing 26% of revenue, upf form $29.5 million and 17% of revenue in Q3 2015.

Shares rose 0.51% in Tuesday's regular session to 37.16. That's right around a possible aggressive entry point, though more conventionally the stock is forming a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 39.15. The company split its stock in 2015 and created a separate, nonvoting Class C stock, which is traded under the Z ticker and trades pretty much in tandem with Zillow Group's ZG.

(DIS)-owned ABC, without paying for it. Here was IBD's report on that ruling.

378,NWS,"""Hopper"" has TV broadcasters hopping mad at Dish Network, which says the technology is a friend, not a foe.The satellite broadcaster's Hopper digital video recorder automatically skips commercials. No need to fast-forward.But by giving subscribers this ad-skipping feature, Dish Network violated programming deals, say TV broadcasters led by CBS (CBS) and News Corp.'s (NWS) Fox.Media firms lost the first round of a court battle to stop Hopper. They're appealing in a San Francisco federal court.Dish Network (DISH) contends it's leading the industry in the right direction as others avoid the harsh reality of changing viewing habits.""I personally believe that as discussions go on, we can show the broadcasters that we're not foe, we're friend, and that the advertising model can work for the consumer, for the content owner, and for the distributor,"" Charles Ergen, Dish Network's chairman and controlling shareholder, said on the company's Q4 earnings call Feb. 20.Why take on the media companies? Dish Network's pay-TV business has stalled. It has just more than 14 million subscribers, the same as in 2009. Its 2012 revenue just rose 1.5% to $14.3 billion.In its newest Hopper set-top box, Dish combines the auto ad-skipping DVR with its Sling technology that lets subscribers send live or recorded TV to Internet-connected devices such as tablets, smartphones and laptop computers.Dish Network's newest service adds fuel to the fire, analysts say, because content companies have been firm in seeking additional programming fees from pay-TV distributors when TV shows are streamed outside of homes.Fox on Feb. 22 sought a court order to block Dish's new TV-anywhere service.The satellite broadcaster has launched a national advertising campaign touting its Dish Anywhere service, as well as its Hopper technology. In one Dish commercial, people gather at a mock wake to remember the death of TV ads. While cable TV rivals have aired Dish's commercials, all of the broadcast networks — Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC — have rejected them.In November, a U.S. district court in Los Angeles denied the broadcast networks' request for an injunction on the Hopper DVR. News Corp. appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which could rule on the case by July.Some analysts say Dish Network and the media companies might settle the Hopper dispute out-of-court, but both sides seem dug in for a battle.If Dish Network wins, it'll have more leverage when programming deals come up for renewal, says Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners. Cable and satellite companies pay ""retransmission fees"" to media companies for the rights to their content.Gallant, though, says Dish could lose.""I don't think AutoHop is necessarily here to stay,"" he said. ""That's what the lawsuit is all about — does AutoHop violate the content companies' copyrights. I think the content companies have the upper hand legally, but it's definitely not a slam-dunk.""On Dish's Q4 call, Ergen said talks will go on no matter how the judge rules.""Somebody will prevail on the litigation and once that happens, then people will talk about how to make it work for everybody,"" he said.Dish Network says it can work with media companies on targeted advertising, helping them reach viewers most likely to be responsive to ads, based on demographics and what they watch.""I think we're a bit misunderstood in the sense that we see the advertising model changing,"" said Ergen on the call. ""What we're really saying to the broadcasters is: There's a way for you to not put your head in the sand. There is a way for you to make more money than you make today from DVRs (from advertising).""

420,NWS,"Online real estate leader Zillow Group (ZG) likely will post a ""modest"" Q4 beat, when the company reports its earnings results after the close Tuesday, with its 2017 outlook likely also to modestly beat on the top line, despite historically conservative guidance from the company, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos said Monday.Kurnos maintained a buy rating on Zillow stock, though he said in a research note that ""the apparent housing bubble and rising interest rate environment"" are medium-term concerns. Those issues, though, could boost near-term results, he pointed out, if home buyers feel more urgency to act now ahead of these trends.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Zillow Group swung to a profit in Q4. They see earnings per share minus items of 11 cents, up from a penny loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expect revenue to rise 31% to $222.3 million.IBD'S TAKE: Zillow Group might be termed an OK stock of late, but what stocks should get highest priority in your tracking system and checklists? IBD's Stock Lists provides the rundown on a number of potential near-term winners.The company moved back into the black in Q2 and Q3 after two quarters in the red. The 31% sales rise would be its biggest since Q1 2016.For the current quarter, analysts model EPS ex items of 6 cents, swinging from a 13-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $236.2 million, up 27%.Kurnos maintained his price target of 43 on Zillow Group stock, writing that ""the fundamental long-term outlook still appears very favorable, as Zillow is likely taking market and mind share from Realtor.com, while still having plenty of pricing headroom with existing agents, particularly power brokers.""Zillow's top rival, realtor.com, is owned by News Corp. (NWS) subsidiary Move Inc., and operates under a perpetual license from the National Association of Realtors.""We believe there is some growing discontent with Realtor.com given the lack of significant quality traffic improvement since being acquired, coupled with degradation in lead quality,"" Kurnos wrote. ""Alternatively, we believe lead quality and conversion has improved at Zillow ... .""Zillow Group has been concentrating on better-performing ""power"" brokers, or what it calls Premier Agents, with its online listings and referrals, which has led to ""intentional churn"" of underperforming agents, Kurnos pointed out.Zillow Group stock rose 1.5% in the stock market today, to 36.97, back above its 50-day line after falling below that level for several sessions. It has been forming a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 39.28.The company split its stock in 2015 and created a separate, nonvoting Class C stock, which is traded under the Z ticker and trades pretty much in tandem with Zillow Group's ZG. The Z-ticker shares rose 1.9% Monday, to 36.62, closing right at its 50-day line. The Z-ticker stock also has a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 39.15.RELATED:Zillow Is In Position To Dominate Online Real Estate Ad MarketZillow Seen Challenged By Rising Interest RatesWill Trump Make Housing, Zillow Stock Great Again?

421,NWS,"Investment bank Stifel initiated coverage of No. 1 online real estate site Zillow Group (Z) with a neutral rating, citing competition, rising interest rates and lack of business outside the U.S. as challenges.Zillow Group stock fell 4.5% to 36.60 in the stock market today, after breaking out of a cup base at a 38.09 buy point on Dec. 15. The stock still is up more than 55% for the year. In 2015, it did a stock split and created a separate, nonvoting Class C stock, which is traded under the Z ticker. The Class A voting shares are under the ZG ticker, and both trade pretty much in tandem. The ZG stock fell 3.4%% Thursday to 37.05.For Q3, Zillow said its number of so-called Premier Agent advertisers had fallen 8% from Q3 2015 to 89,147, but leads to these agents had risen 40% while average revenue per advertiser rose 46% to $585 per month. Revenue from Premier Agent advertisers, who pay for such things as good listing placement on the site, account for about 70% of the company's revenue.IBD'S TAKE: Swing Trader is IBD's exclusive list of stocks set up for possible quick profits, but it changes fast. Zillow triggered a sell rule and was dropped from Swing Trader on Thursday, but see which tech and other stocks are still on the list.As Stifel notes in its research report, Zillow is focusing on the most successful real estate agents, encouraging lower-performing agents/advertising to join more successful real estate agents or agent teams.But, wrote Stifel, ""we believe the company can only sustain a pricing led strategy for a limited period of time and that the company will need to resume Premier Agent volume growth in future quarters rather than rely on higher spending from existing advertisers.""Also, says Stifel, because Zillow's success is so tied to the health of the housing sales market, the recent interest rate hike, likely to be followed by others, could weigh.In addition, Stifel says Zillow faces competition from search engines, especially search leader Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL). But its top rival is Realtor.com, which is operated by News Corp. (NWS) subsidiary Move.

422,NWS,"Entertainment giant 21st Century Fox (FOX) agreed to acquire Britain's Sky networks for $14.6 billion on Thursday, in Rupert Murdoch's second run at Europe's dominant pay-TV company, as the media billionaire seeks to consolidate his television empire across two continents.Fox, which already holds a 39% stake in London-based Sky, will pay roughly $13.42 in U.S. dollars per share for the rest, according to a statement. That represents a premium of 36% over Sky's closing price on Dec. 8, the day before the companies disclosed a preliminary offer. Murdoch is returning after a previous bid was thwarted in 2011 over a phone-hacking scandal at his newspapers.The deal gives Fox a distribution platform to complement its film studio and cable channels like FX and National Geographic. Sky provides satellite-TV service to 21.8 million customers across the U.K., Ireland, Italy, Germany and Austria, and has been adding exclusive entertainment and original content to its core sports offerings while expanding into broadband and mobile service.The purchase ""creates a global leader in content creation and distribution, enhances our sports and entertainment scale, and gives us unique and leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and technologies,"" Fox said in the statement.Fox pledged to keep Sky's headquarters in London and complete a $1.25 billion investment in the campus. The company also said it expects Sky News to maintain ""its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code.""For Murdoch, the timing of the deal is right: Momentum behind U.S. stocks continues to build as traders bet that President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on promises to cut regulations and reduce taxes, helping to drive earnings growth. In the U.K., the pound has weakened against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes the acquisition cheaper for New York-based Fox.Murdoch's Sky bid follows AT&T's (T) $85.4 billion deal earlier this year to acquire Time Warner (TWX), owner of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros., as traditional media push for scale to combat online video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Both deals would establish new beachheads for the companies, combining the delivery of content with the content itself.Sky shares have traded below the offer price, first disclosed on Dec. 9, as investors weigh regulatory and political risks to the deal. The U.K. government can ask media regulator Ofcom to check whether the merger might harm plurality in the country's media.However, Murdoch may be counting on changes to the media landscape and U.K. politics to clear the way. Unlike when Murdoch's News Corp. (NWS) bid for Sky in 2010, Fox doesn't own any U.K. newspapers and the rise of digital outlets may also work in the bid's favor, as people rely less on TV, radio and print publications to get their news.Prime Minister Theresa May has been eager to promote investment in the U.K. in the wake of the Brexit vote. Still, critics of the deal are airing their grievances. Any takeover agreement should be delayed until after second phase of inquiry into press malpractice, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote to U.K. Culture Minister Karen Bradley, the Guardian reported.Fox may need to address resistance from some Sky shareholders pushing a bigger payout than the preliminary offer, which matches a price Sky's shares reached in February. The stock had slumped this year amid concerns about the rising cost of sports rights, competition from digital rivals such as Netflix (NFLX) and skepticism about Sky's ability to deliver double-digit revenue growth in Germany.While consolidating Sky is expected to save Fox in areas like taxes, some analysts have questioned the deal's strategic value.""We scratch our heads in terms of what a distribution company headquartered in the U.K. does for a global content company headquartered in the U.S. over the long term,"" Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a research note. ""We're not buyin' it.""Sky has been seeking to stave off competition from phone and cable companies, in part by securing rights to exclusive programming such as HBO shows, and spending on original dramas like ""Fortitude."" The company has paid record sums to air Premier League matches and keep ahead of BT Group Plc, which also broadcasts some of the league's games.To diversify further, Sky has expanded into broadband, and it's starting a mobile phone service, an attempt to crack a $19 billion market in the U.K.Murdoch has long made clear his desire to own all of Sky. He was derailed in his 2010 attempt to buy out other shareholders for $9.7 billion, after revelations that two of his newspapers hacked into the mobile phones of celebrities and politicians.Fox's latest approach has spurred fresh complaints over corporate governance at Sky, where Murdoch's son James returned as chairman this year. James Murdoch, 44, leads Fox as chief executive and was Sky's CEO from 2003 to 2007.""It would have been preferable to have an independent chairman,"" Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London, a Sky shareholder, said in a Dec. 12 statement. The creation of an independent board committee to evaluate the bid ""addresses some of the conflicts of interest, however it doesn't go far enough.""

423,NWS,"The nonprofit news organization ProPublica typically receives about 10 donations a day but on Monday, its website was deluged with about three every minute.ProPublica is one of several outlets, including the New York Times (NYT) and News Corp.'s (NWS) Wall Street Journal, witnessing a swell in donations or subscriptions since Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 election.ProPublica, the Times and the Washington Post got a boost Sunday from HBO comic John Oliver, who lamented ""fake facts"" that circulated on social media during the campaign and urged viewers to ""support actual journalism.""""A lot of people after the election feel compelled to respond in one civic way or another, and journalism is an important part of that,"" said Richard Tofel, ProPublica's president.The support is a hopeful sign for an industry looking to answer how so many journalists missed the Trump surge. Hurt by the loss of readers and advertisers over many years, newspaper publishers have had to cut their staffs and pare their coverage. The Wall Street Journal cut at least 50 positions this month.At the Times, new print and digital subscriptions have risen at four times their normal rate since Election Day, according to spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. The company saw record traffic on its website Nov. 8 through Nov. 10, the newspaper said in a statement Monday.In a Nov. 13 letter to readers, New York Times Chairman and Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Executive Editor Dean Baquet vowed to ""rededicate"" the newspaper ""to the fundamental mission of Times journalism.""While the two said they believed their coverage of both presidential candidates was fair, they also asked, ""Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?"" Baquet also said separately in a Times story that journalists have ""to do a much better job of being on the road, out in the country, talking to different kinds of people than the people we talk to.""The letter prompted Trump to write on Twitter on Sunday that the Times was ""apologizing for their bad coverage of me."" In another post that day he said, ""Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.' "" His tweets spurred several journalists, including some at rival newspapers, to tweet back that more people should subscribe to the Times.At the Wall Street Journal, new subscriber volume spiked 300% on the day after the election, spokeswoman Colleen Schwartz said.Investors have taken notice. Publicly traded newspaper stocks have marched higher since Election Day, with the largest publisher, Gannett (GCI), up 18% to lead the group. The Standard & Poor's 500 Media Index, which includes TV, advertising and cable, has gained 3.7%.McClatchy (MNI) is up 13% while the New York Times has added 11%. Tronc (TRNC), which owns the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, is up 10% while News Corp. has added more than 4%. The Washington Post is owned by Amazon.com (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos.Newsrooms are girding for battle with a president who pushed hard to discredit journalists in the eyes of his supporters. Trump dismissed critical stories as lies, barred reporters from his rallies, called for tougher libel laws and threatened to sue the Times for reporting on women who said they'd been groped and kissed by him without their consent.Tofel said he ""got a little heads-up"" from Oliver's staff that the HBO host would call on viewers to donate to ProPublica. The producers asked if his website could handle the traffic that would likely result.""We first saw a very substantial uptick, late Tuesday night when elections results were clear,"" Tofel said. ""Then it went to a very different level after the John Oliver broadcast.""The public show of support for news organizations has also extended to public radio. KCRW, one of two outlets in the Los Angeles area associated with National Public Radio, experienced a doubling of donations in the week after the election, according to Jennifer Ferro, president of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based station.""We weren't asking,"" Ferro said in an email, ""so obviously this was spontaneous,""

""This is up from $2.3 billion in commissions and $350 million in spend as of 2014,"" he said.With the reclassification of some of its display ad revenue, Zillow's full-year display revenue guidance of $54 million to $56 million, down from $96 million in 2015, ""is not as severe as previously thought,"" said Champion.Zillow is counting on continuing growth in areas including rentals, mortgages, DotLoop, and StreetEasy -- the residential real-estate website for shoppers in the New York region -- to drive growth, he said.Zillow stock jumped last week after the No. 1 online real estate listings company got a price-target boost and rating upgrade from RBC Capital Markets, which cited strong online traffic trends.

On Tuesday, shares hit their lowest point since December 2013.Shares have plummeted 41% since mid-February, when the company completed its acquisition of top competitor Trulia and hit an eight-month high of 133.20.Zillow has declined 53% from its all-time high of 164.90, which it touched a year ago, when the Trulia merger was announced.Results this quarter were tweaked to reflect the Trulia acquisition. The unified company's earnings report presented growth and profit numbers as if the deal had been completed on Jan. 1, 2014 and excludes acquisition and restructuring costs. The pro forma earnings for Q2 included Zillow and Trulia along with its StreetEasy and HotPads consumer brands.Zillow said revenue rose 20% year over year to $171.3 million, above the high end of Wall Street's guidance and above the pro forma revenue of $142.8 million for Q2 2014.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Zillow to post revenue of $168.7 million.Zillow posted a net loss minus items of 1 cent, narrower than its loss of 5 cents in Q2 2014. Analysts had expected Zillow to report a net loss minus items of 26 cents per share.For Q3, Zillow guided revenue of $175 million to $177 million, up 98% at the midpoint year over year. However, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting $180.8 million.Zillow did not give a Q3 EPS estimate. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast a loss of 5 cents excluding items.In an earnings note Wednesday, Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge wrote that Zillow's revenue beat was of ""low quality"" and expressed concerns about the company's loss of agent subscriptions.""All-in-all, subscriptions revenues were $115.1 million versus our forecast of $120.1 million. We think advertiser count will decline further given the migration of agents onto a unified platform. Zillow's management said the most 'intense' phase of the integration lies ahead,"" said Blackledge.High-spending ""premier agent"" subscriptions of 101,297 in the quarter ""fell short of consensus' 107,500 estimate, reflecting a combination of integration issues and, according to management, one-off churn events,"" wrote Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos in a Wednesday industry note. ""Core premier agent average revenue per agent $375 was also a touch lower than anticipated ... likely driven by a greater-than-expected impact from Trulia,"" said Kurnos.In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff described the Trulia real estate agents who have left the company in recent months as ""low producing,"" while those who stayed are bringing in higher average revenue per agent amounts.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in an industry report on Wednesday that ""We view the material EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) beat as a positive and are encouraged by the cost synergies Zillow is finding from the Trulia integration.""Mahaney said that 2015 is playing out as ""a transition year"" as Zillow works through its ""integration challenges"" with the Trulia acquisition. ""Zillow is also working through a strategy shift, focusing on generating revenue from higher-quality/spend agents,"" Mahaney said.In April, Rascoff told analysts that the online real estate site would miss 2015 expectations, partly because the lengthy federal review of its Trulia acquisition hurt its agent-ad business.Since the merger was finalized, competition in online real estate has intensified, with media empire News Corp. (NWS)-owned Realtor.com gaining traction as growth at Trulia has slowed.Follow Michele Chandler on Twitter: @IBD_MChandler.

528,NWS,"It didn't take long for Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts to tout the Syfy channel's new show ""Defiance"" on the firm's Q1 earnings conference call Wednesday, amid audience ratings woes at NBC Universal.
"
529,NWS,"Comcast's cable TV business turned in generally strong Q1 results, with revenue up 6.4% to $10.2 billion though video subscriber losses rose 62% from the year-earlier quarter, to 60,000.
"
530,NWS,"But NBCU's revenue fell 2.4% to $5.34 billion, including a 5.3% decline at broadcaster NBC, where ratings have weakened vs. Walt Disney's (DIS) ABC, CBS (CBS) and Fox. Ad revenue, though, rose 2.5% despite lower ratings at some of Comcast's cable channels, which generated 90% of NBCU's Q1 operating cash flow.
"
531,NWS,"Broadcaster NBC and Comcast's cable channels — which besides Syfy include Bravo, USA Network, E, Style, Golf and CNBC — are battling for viewers against popular rivals such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" online video firm Netflix's (NFLX) ""House of Cards,"" and AMC Networks' (AMCX) ""The Walking Dead.""
"
532,NWS,"Buying All Of NBCU
"
533,NWS,"Improving ratings at NBC and the cable channels are key for Comcast, which in February agreed to buy General Electric's (GE) remaining stake in NBC Universal for $16.7 billion. Comcast bought 51% of NBCU from GE in early 2011.
"
534,NWS,"Comcast says it's investing more in original programming rather than relying on episodes of past seasons and old movies. That's where Syfy's ""Defiance"" comes in.
"
535,NWS,"NBCU reportedly has spent nearly $100 million developing Syfy's new science-fiction show, which is being promoted along with a companion multiplayer online video game. Defiance was launched on April 15, so its financial impact won't be known for a while.
"
536,NWS,"Roberts says it's a sign of more innovative programming to come from NBCU.
"
537,NWS,"""Defiance was Syfy's most-watched scripted series premiere in seven years,"" giving Syfy its most viewers since 2009, Roberts said.
"
538,NWS,"Comcast is promoting the series on the Internet, video-on-demand services and its TV screen guides.
"
539,NWS,"Broadcaster NBC's Q1 revenue fell, to $1.52 billion, as lower prime-time ratings hit ad sales. The broadcast unit's operating cash flow loss widened to $35 million in Q1 from $14 million in Q1 2012. The broadcast unit contributes roughly a third of NBCU's revenue.
"
540,NWS,"On Comcast's Q1 earnings call, NBCU CEO Steve Burke said the company needs to develop more hit shows besides ""The Voice.""
"

621,NWS,"In a report, Goldman Sachs said the higher-than-expected Q1 video subscriber losses might have been related to price hikes pushed through by Comcast.It didn't take long for Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts to tout the Syfy channel's new show ""Defiance"" on the firm's Q1 earnings conference call Wednesday, amid audience ratings woes at NBC Universal.Comcast's cable TV business turned in generally strong Q1 results, with revenue up 6.4% to $10.2 billion though video subscriber losses rose 62% from the year-earlier quarter, to 60,000.But NBCU's revenue fell 2.4% to $5.34 billion, including a 5.3% decline at broadcaster NBC, where ratings have weakened vs. Walt Disney's (DIS) ABC, CBS (CBS) and Fox. Ad revenue, though, rose 2.5% despite lower ratings at some of Comcast's cable channels, which generated 90% of NBCU's Q1 operating cash flow.Broadcaster NBC and Comcast's cable channels — which besides Syfy include Bravo, USA Network, E, Style, Golf and CNBC — are battling for viewers against popular rivals such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" online video firm Netflix's (NFLX) ""House of Cards,"" and AMC Networks' (AMCX) ""The Walking Dead.""Buying All Of NBCUImproving ratings at NBC and the cable channels are key for Comcast, which in February agreed to buy General Electric's (GE) remaining stake in NBC Universal for $16.7 billion. Comcast bought 51% of NBCU from GE in early 2011.Comcast says it's investing more in original programming rather than relying on episodes of past seasons and old movies. That's where Syfy's ""Defiance"" comes in.NBCU reportedly has spent nearly $100 million developing Syfy's new science-fiction show, which is being promoted along with a companion multiplayer online video game. Defiance was launched on April 15, so its financial impact won't be known for a while.Roberts says it's a sign of more innovative programming to come from NBCU.""Defiance was Syfy's most-watched scripted series premiere in seven years,"" giving Syfy its most viewers since 2009, Roberts said.Comcast is promoting the series on the Internet, video-on-demand services and its TV screen guides.Broadcaster NBC's Q1 revenue fell, to $1.52 billion, as lower prime-time ratings hit ad sales. The broadcast unit's operating cash flow loss widened to $35 million in Q1 from $14 million in Q1 2012. The broadcast unit contributes roughly a third of NBCU's revenue.On Comcast's Q1 earnings call, NBCU CEO Steve Burke said the company needs to develop more hit shows besides ""The Voice.""""When we announced the (GE) deal a couple of years ago, we said that it would take something like three to five years to get momentum at the broadcast network,"" Burke said.""I think we made good progress in the first couple of years, primarily with 'The Voice.' We have a few other shows that are showing glimmers of hope. We really need to get one or two more good shows. But we're making progress.""Content Said 'Volatile'Broadcasting the Feb. 5, 2012, Super Bowl lifted NBC's rating last year. CBS carried this year's game.""We expect the content business to remain volatile due to one-time impacts and as the company looks to invest in long-term growth,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a report.Analysts say NBCU remains a turnaround project. In Q1, revenue rose 4.6% overall at the cable channel unit to $2.23 billion, in line with views, and 2% to $1.22 billion at the film unit, movie studio Universal Pictures.Revenue at NBCU's theme parks in Hollywood, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., boosted by the new Wizarding World of Harry Potter, rose 12% to $462 million.Comcast has been thrifty since taking over NBCU. Corporate overhead fell $48 million in Q1, says Vijay Jayant, an analyst at ISI Group. ""NBCU missed on revenue, but made up for it in margin,"" he said via email.At the cable unit, Comcast said costs to acquire programming rose 8.5% in Q1 to $2.25 billion.Comcast recently renewed content deals with Disney and News Corp. (NWS).Rising costs to acquire programming have been pressuring the profitability of cable TV firms. They aim to pass along higher programming fees to subscribers in annual rate hikes.In a report, Goldman Sachs said the higher-than-expected Q1 video subscriber losses might have been related to price hikes pushed through by Comcast.

622,NWS,"Timing is money. Just ask Fox Networks. Last week it started barring everyone but paying customers from watching its TV shows online until eight days after they first run. It's one way TV networks are angling for more dollars from the digital revolution. Other ways that networks may get them are via ""enhanced"" advertising and by reselling old shows online,…
"
623,NWS,"Live from media capital New York, it's an iPad controversy.
"
624,NWS,"Content owners led by Viacom (VIA) and News Corp. (NWS) are feuding with some content distributors — pay-TV providers Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Cablevision Systems (CVC) — over live programs whisked to iPads via wireless Internet connections in homes.
"
625,NWS,"All the companies are New York-based, but the fight has industrywide ramifications as the players try to figure out who gets paid what as viewers start watching content on more types of screens.
"
626,NWS,"Content firms have warmed up to the idea of distributing old movies or taped TV shows on the Internet through Netflix (NFLX) and others. But streaming something like ""Saturday Night Live"" fresh to an iPad is not something most content firms are ready to do. Not unless they're paid extra, that is.
"
627,NWS,"""The entertainment companies that have an iPad issue aren't saying it's a bad business idea,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Bryan Kraft. ""It's about money and monetizing their programming in as many ways as they can.""
"
628,NWS,"$24.8 Billion For Programs
"
629,NWS,"Pay-TV providers — cable, satellite and phone companies — ponied up about $24.8 billion in programming rights in 2010 to content owners such as Viacom, Time Warner (TWX), News Corp., Disney (DIS) and Discovery Communications (DISCA), says market research firm SNL Kagan.
"
630,NWS,"The fees the distributors pay content owners have been climbing almost 11% a year. Thus, content firms have been winning most recent squabbles over money.
"
631,NWS,"Pay-TV providers also pay the big four TV broadcast networks fees, just like cable channels. And they've started to pay for rights to distribute content at subscriber-only websites.
"
632,NWS,"Content firms have been on a roll, but Time Warner Cable aims to slow them down. The cable firm says an iPad or similar tablet computer is just another kind of media-viewing screen.
"
633,NWS,"And it says it has the right to send programs to all Web-connected screens.
"
634,NWS,"But content firms say cable and all pay-TV firms must pay extra for iPad viewing rights. They say they need that extra fee in part because iPad viewership isn't helping them boost their ad rates, because Nielsen and others aren't counting those viewers.
"
635,NWS,"Viacom and Time Warner Cable traded lawsuits in the first week of April, and observers say the courts could rule either way.
"
636,NWS,"Time Warner Cable has pulled a dozen channels from its iPad lineup to appease content owners, but it still offers 30-plus channels as a perk to its subscribers.
"
637,NWS,"Time Warner Cable and all distributors will in the long run be forced into bargaining with content providers, says Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey. Content firms depend on pay-TV providers' programming fees, he says.
"
638,NWS,"Multiple Screens
"
639,NWS,"But revenue-sharing models are in flux as consumers watch content on multiple screens — standard TVs, computers and mobile devices.

640,NWS,"Cable firms aim to be the preferred partners of content firms, McQuivey says, hoping to prevent more programs from moving to Netflix.
"
641,NWS,"""Time Warner Cable and other (cable firms) hope to expand their rights without too much fuss and keep revenue in the pay-TV world,"" McQuivey said. ""They're presuming that would make Viacom and others happy.""
"
642,NWS,"Netflix is encroaching on pay TV, McQuivey says. Netflix has an iPad app.
"
643,NWS,"And Netflix subscribers also can download programs to laptop computers, game players or Blu-ray players that can be tethered to TVs.
"
644,NWS,"""It's getting harder to monetize content on the basis of what devices consumers are using,"" McQuivey said. ""Netflix has been writing the rules. If you're a Netflix subscriber, you can access Netflix's content on any device.""
"
645,NWS,"Nomura Securities analyst Mike McCormack also says cable TV firms will wind up paying for iPad rights.
"
646,NWS,"""IPad apps are likely going to be an additional payment trigger for programming fees,"" McCormick said.
"
647,NWS,"Amid the dust-up, Disney's ESPN plans to release its own iPad app in May. It also plans to sell advertising on its iPad platform.
"
648,NWS,"And ESPN's content might appear on Time Warner Cable's iPad lineup. ""We're in talks with them,"" said ESPN spokeswoman Amy Phillips.
"
649,NWS,"One issue is that TWC's system doesn't black out local sports events, a capability that ESPN needs under its own broadcast rights, says Phillips. The WatchESPN app coming in May will require iPad users to supply cable-account information, so viewers would have to subscribe to a pay-TV partner.
"
650,NWS,"Broadcast networks NBC Universal and ABC have launched their own iPad apps, but neither provides live streaming TV.
"
651,NWS,"Comcast (CMCSA), the No. 1 cable TV firm, acquired NBC Universal in January, which might be why Comcast isn't joining TWC in taking on content firms. Comcast has released its own iPad apps, but unlike TWC, none of them provide the live programming.

652,NWS,"Comcast Plans To Stream
"
653,NWS,"Comcast plans ""to launch in-home streaming of live TV on tablets later this year,"" said Comcast spokesman Peter Dobrow.
"
654,NWS,"Time Warner Cable and Comcast aim to make their customers happier by providing iPad viewing perks. Kraft says that makes good marketing because consumers need to order both TV and broadband service in order to get iPad viewing.

"
657,NWS,"Cable TV firms run a risk that customers will need fewer set-top boxes if they're watching TV on iPads or Web-connected TVs. Consumers pay about $10 to $15 a month for extra set-tops and digital service. While cable TV firms could lose that revenue, they'll save on costs to send out field technicians for service calls, says Kraft.

702,NWS,"Zillow (Z) expects to carry more home listings after the online real estate website's agreement ends next month with real estate syndication service ListHub, not fewer, the company insists.Zillow took aim Tuesday at a Cowen & Co. research report released early in the day that said the No. 1 real estate website would see its number of listings fall once it's no longer able to display home listings provided by ListHub, after an agreement between the companies ends April 7.Instead of a negative, Zillow says its split with ListHub is just the latest example of the company eschewing third-party services.Zillow has developed its own tools enabling brokerages and multiple listing services to connect with the company directly, Zillow spokeswoman Dawn Lyon told IBD. ""This has been an effort that has been underway for a while, recognizing that having those direct relationships, those direct feeds, are far more accurate than relying on third-party services,"" she said.Zillow has cut ties with other third-party real estate information providers.

"
711,NWS,"All the companies are New York-based, but the fight has industrywide ramifications as the players try to figure out who gets paid what as viewers start watching content on more types of screens.
"
712,NWS,"Content firms have warmed up to the idea of distributing old movies or taped TV shows on the Internet through Netflix (NFLX) and others. But streaming something like ""Saturday Night Live"" fresh to an iPad is not something most content firms are ready to do. Not unless they're paid extra, that is.
"
713,NWS,"""The entertainment companies that have an iPad issue aren't saying it's a bad business idea,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Bryan Kraft. ""It's about money and monetizing their programming in as many ways as they can.""
"
714,NWS,"$24.8 Billion For Programs
"
715,NWS,"Pay-TV providers — cable, satellite and phone companies — ponied up about $24.8 billion in programming rights in 2010 to content owners such as Viacom, Time Warner (TWX), News Corp., Disney (DIS) and Discovery Communications (DISCA), says market research firm SNL Kagan.
"
716,NWS,"The fees the distributors pay content owners have been climbing almost 11% a year. Thus, content firms have been winning most recent squabbles over money.
"
717,NWS,"Pay-TV providers also pay the big four TV broadcast networks fees, just like cable channels. And they've started to pay for rights to distribute content at subscriber-only websites.
"
718,NWS,"Content firms have been on a roll, but Time Warner Cable aims to slow them down. The cable firm says an iPad or similar tablet computer is just another kind of media-viewing screen.
"
719,NWS,"And it says it has the right to send programs to all Web-connected screens.
"
720,NWS,"But content firms say cable and all pay-TV firms must pay extra for iPad viewing rights. They say they need that extra fee in part because iPad viewership isn't helping them boost their ad rates, because Nielsen and others aren't counting those viewers.
"
721,NWS,"Viacom and Time Warner Cable traded lawsuits in the first week of April, and observers say the courts could rule either way.
"
722,NWS,"Time Warner Cable has pulled a dozen channels from its iPad lineup to appease content owners, but it still offers 30-plus channels as a perk to its subscribers.

"
727,NWS,"""Time Warner Cable and other (cable firms) hope to expand their rights without too much fuss and keep revenue in the pay-TV world,"" McQuivey said. ""They're presuming that would make Viacom and others happy.""

730,NWS,"""It's getting harder to monetize content on the basis of what devices consumers are using,"" McQuivey said. ""Netflix has been writing the rules. If you're a Netflix subscriber, you can access Netflix's content on any device.""

735,NWS,"One issue is that TWC's system doesn't black out local sports events, a capability that ESPN needs under its own broadcast rights, says Phillips.

801,NWS,"Shares of Time Warner Cable (TWC) dived on Thursday after the pay-TV company forecast lower profit margins because of new product initiatives and rising programming costs, especially sports content.
"
802,NWS,"Time Warner Cable's stock fell 11.2% to a four-month low. TWC early Thursday reported Q4 EPS above views but added fewer broadband customers than estimated. Revenue also was a bit light.
"
803,NWS,"The New York-based company forecast 2013 revenue growth of 3% to 4%, about the same as 2012. The cable TV firm said it expects OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) margins to contract because of rising programing costs and less political advertising in a nonpresidential election year.
"
804,NWS,"On an earnings conference call with analysts, TWC CEO Glenn Britt defended the company's recent moves to acquire sports content through deals with baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and basketball's L.A. Lakers, saying this would stabilize programming costs over the long term.
"
805,NWS,"""One thing I'd remind you (analysts) about margins is that it's a good conversation about costs, and it's a good measure of whether we're managing costs, but at the end of the day ... we actually don't run the business for margin, we run it for the bottom line,"" Britt said. ""So if we can sell more of a lower-margin product but it adds to the bottom line, we'll do that.""
"
806,NWS,"Analysts estimate that Time Warner Cable will pay about $10 billion combined for the two teams' broadcast rights over 20-25 years.
"
807,NWS,"Britt reiterated plans to dump cable TV channels with low viewership that, in his view, charge too much in programming fees.
"
808,NWS,"TWC said it plans to spend more on product and service initiatives aimed at reducing customer disconnects. In Q4, Time Warner Cable said it had a net loss of 129,000 video customers, less than the 155,000 shed in Q4 2011. But it added only 75,000 broadband Internet customers, down from 180,000 a year earlier.

"
812,NWS,"TWC said video programming costs rose 7% to $1.2 billion in Q4 and 6.4% in 2012, to $4.6 billion. Rights to sports content is the biggest driver of those costs. Pay-TV providers are charged billions of dollars each year by Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN channel, as well as by regional sports networks.
"
813,NWS,"Britt says Time Warner Cable is better off acquiring rights to Lakers and Dodgers games itself rather than paying others to broadcast their games.
"
814,NWS,"On Monday, TWC announced a deal, said to be worth about $7 billion, to broadcast Dodger games on a new network, called SportNet LA. TWC beat out Fox owner News Corp. (NWS), which had aimed to renew rights to Dodger games. As with the Lakers, Time Warner Cable will seek programming fees for Dodgers games from other pay-TV providers.
"
815,NWS,"""In the case of sports, we've taken some steps toward managing and stabilizing costs through our Lakers and Dodgers deals,"" Britt said. ""Our sense is that if we're going to carry these games, they're going to be expensive however we get them.

"
828,NWS,"High expectations are the new normal for Charter Communications (CHTR), the nation's No. 4 cable TV firm.
"
829,NWS,"Shares of Charter have jumped nearly 50% in 2013, with much of the gain coming after John Malone-controlled Liberty Media Group (LMCA) took a 27% stake in Charter for $2.6 billion in March. Shares of once-bankrupt Charter began climbing in late 2011, after it named Tom Rutledge as CEO. Many analysts had forecast a rebound under Rutledge, the former chief operating officer of Cablevision Systems (CVC).
"
830,NWS,"Under Rutledge, Charter has been spending heavily to upgrade its network, aiming to rake in higher-spending customers.
"
831,NWS,"Liberty Media is now the biggest shareholder in Charter, after completing its purchase of shares from private equity firms Apollo Management and Oaktree Capital. Observers speculate Malone ultimately will seek control of Charter.
"
832,NWS,"The question is whether Charter will target smaller cable firms as acquisitions amid its turnaround.
"
833,NWS,"Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, in that company's earnings conference call this month, said that Charter could be a buyer. But he also indicated it could possibly be a seller, surprising some analysts.
"
834,NWS,"""I think the Charter business plan on a stand-alone basis is very attractive,"" Maffei told analysts. ""Whether Charter is a consolidator or a consolidatee, we'll see.""
"
835,NWS,"Charter expects to close its purchase of Cablevision's Optimum West in Q3. It's buying the firm, formerly called Bresnan Communications, for $1.62 billion in cash. That deal was announced in February, before Liberty Media took its stake in Charter.
"
836,NWS,"""They've already done one very attractive transaction in the form of Bresnan,"" Maffei said of Charter. He said the cable industry ""could be in for a round of consolidation,"" with borrowing costs low and companies generating stable cash flows despite tougher competition.
"
837,NWS,"If Charter pursues acquisitions, Macquarie Capital analyst Amy Yong expects them to be in smaller markets.
"
838,NWS,"Malone wasn't sure how cable companies would fare amid regulatory changes in the late 1990s. The cable industry pioneer sold his Tele-Communications Inc. to AT&T in 1999. That opened the door for Comcast (CMCSA) to emerge as the No. 1 U.S. cable company. It bought AT&T Broadband in 2002.
"
839,NWS,"Malone's media and pay-TV assets are still huge. Malone-controlled Liberty Global (LBTYA) expects to close its purchase of U.K.-based Virgin Media in June. Liberty Global is one of Europe's biggest pay-TV players.
"
840,NWS,"Liberty Media, meanwhile, spun-off cable channel Starz (STRZA) in January. Aside from the Charter stake, Liberty Media owns a controlling stake in Sirius XM Radio (SIRI) and has investments in Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Live Nation (LYV). It also has small stakes in Time Warner Cable (TWC), Time Warner (TWX) and Viacom (VIA).
"
841,NWS,"Malone, as an individual, is a large, and passive, investor in satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group (DTV), whose stock has been soaring. Malone briefly controlled DirecTV after a complex 2008 deal with Rupert Murdoch that reduced Malone's stake in News Corp. (NWS).
"
842,NWS,"Many of Malone's deals have aimed at minimizing tax liabilities, analysts say. Charter holds sizable tax credits. That could provide Liberty Media with some flexibility, if it gains control of the cable TV firm down the road, analysts say.
"
843,NWS,"Charter has $7.7 billion in net operating loss, or NOL, credits, William Power, an RW Baird analyst, said in an April research report.
"
844,NWS,"""At the end of 2012, (Charter) possessed $7.7 billion in net operating loss carryforwards and an additional $8.9 billion in stepped up tax assets, which will likely prevent the company from paying meaningful cash taxes until 2018 or later,"" Power wrote.
"
845,NWS,"Liberty Media has agreed to keep its ownership stake in Charter at no more than 35% until January 2016, and no more than 40% thereafter.
"
846,NWS,"Meanwhile, analysts say Charter's turnaround under Rutledge is still a work in progress.
"
847,NWS,"Charter lost 24,000 video customers in Q1, giving it 3.965 million customers. It's the 8th-largest pay-TV provider, when including satellite and phone companies in addition to cable providers. Q1 revenue rose 4.9% from the year-earlier period to $1.92 billion, just above views.
"
848,NWS,"It capital spending jumped 23% in Q1, to $412 million. Charter is converting its cable network to all-digital technology so it can offer more products and services.
"
849,NWS,"""Acceleration in Q1 Charter revenue growth was notable, and suggests that management is executing its operating and marketing strategies well — impressive given the numerous changes were just made in the middle of 2012,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Doug Mitchelson in a report.

The cable industry pioneer sold his Tele-Communications Inc. to AT&T in 1999. That opened the door for Comcast (CMCSA) to emerge as the No. 1 U.S. cable company. It bought AT&T Broadband in 2002.Malone's media and pay-TV assets are still huge. Malone-controlled Liberty Global (LBTYA) expects to close its purchase of U.K.-based Virgin Media in June. Liberty Global is one of Europe's biggest pay-TV players.Liberty Media, meanwhile, spun-off cable channel Starz (STRZA) in January. Aside from the Charter stake, Liberty Media owns a controlling stake in Sirius XM Radio (SIRI) and has investments in Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Live Nation (LYV). It also has small stakes in Time Warner Cable (TWC), Time Warner (TWX) and Viacom (VIA).Malone, as an individual, is a large, and passive, investor in satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group (DTV), whose stock has been soaring. Malone briefly controlled DirecTV after a complex 2008 deal with Rupert Murdoch that reduced Malone's stake in News Corp. (NWS).Many of Malone's deals have aimed at minimizing tax liabilities, analysts say. Charter holds sizable tax credits. That could provide Liberty Media with some flexibility, if it gains control of the cable TV firm down the road, analysts say.Charter has $7.7 billion in net operating loss, or NOL, credits, William Power, an RW Baird analyst, said in an April research report.""At the end of 2012, (Charter) possessed $7.7 billion in net operating loss carryforwards and an additional $8.9 billion in stepped up tax assets, which will likely prevent the company from paying meaningful cash taxes until 2018 or later,"" Power wrote.Liberty Media has agreed to keep its ownership stake in Charter at no more than 35% until January 2016, and no more than 40% thereafter.Meanwhile, analysts say Charter's turnaround under Rutledge is still a work in progress.Charter lost 24,000 video customers in Q1, giving it 3.965 million customers. It's the 8th-largest pay-TV provider, when including satellite and phone companies in addition to cable providers. Q1 revenue rose 4.9% from the year-earlier period to $1.92 billion, just above views.It capital spending jumped 23% in Q1, to $412 million. Charter is converting its cable network to all-digital technology so it can offer more products and services.""Acceleration in Q1 Charter revenue growth was notable, and suggests that management is executing its operating and marketing strategies well — impressive given the numerous changes were just made in the middle of 2012,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Doug Mitchelson in a report. ""(One) key remains the ability of the company to gain video share in what looks to be a flat video marketplace going forward, a greater challenge than five or 10 years ago when the marketplace was growing rapidly.""

The company cited strong ad sales for the better-than-expected figures.Scripps' results, nonetheless, didn't measure up to many other Spotlight stocks, a problem with other major media companies.Disney's 29% profit increase was decent, but its 4% revenue growth was not. Time Warner's earnings fell 2%; Mexico-based Grupo Televisa (TV), which also is at new highs, posted a 28% EPS decline. CBS' (CBS) Q2 earnings rose just 12% as sales dipped 3%.

896,NWS,"It's Christmas Eve and you haven't started your Christmas shopping yet. No problem.In the digital age, you can wait until the very last minute and still have plenty of time to get gifts for your loved ones.Thanks to ""digital gifting,"" you can complete your holiday shopping from your PC or mobile device and have it delivered instantly to your recipient's email inbox.""Digital gifting continues to grow because older consumers are becoming more familiar with it and younger consumers who grew up with a computer in their crib have always been comfortable with this,"" Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for retail tracker NPD Group, told IBD.Here's a handy guide to all-digital Christmas gifts.Traditional Gift CardsThe ability to email digital gift cards has been around for awhile. A new twist is that recipients now can put that money in a digital wallet like Apple's (AAPL) Passport app for the iPhone.With digital wallets, consumers can spend their gift certificate money from their mobile phone while they're out shopping.The digital gifting market also has gone social.In September, social network leader Facebook (FB) launched Facebook Gifts. The service turns user data into gift suggestions that people can buy, and the recipients are instantly notified. Buyers also don't need to know the user's street address to send them a physical product.San Francisco-based startup Gyft has created a digital gift card platform for storing and redeeming retailer gift cards on smartphones. Gyft customers also can send electronic gift cards through Facebook, Twitter, text messages and email.Another San Francisco startup, GiftRocket, takes the idea of gift cards and makes them much more flexible.People sending a GiftRocket gift card are essentially sending a cash gift, but they can suggest where and how to spend it. The recipient instantly redeems the gift card by transferring the money to a bank or PayPal account, credit card or check in the mail. The recipient uses the money for whatever he or she wants.A similar service, Giftly, also based in San Francisco, lets people send cash with specific recommendations for its use, such as a day spa, house cleaning or concert tickets.Washington, D.C.-based startup Treater lets Facebook users treat friends to a cup of coffee, lunch, cupcakes and other items. Gift certificates are delivered through text, email or Facebook and can be redeemed from a smartphone at the retailer.Stockholm-based Wrapp lets people send gift cards to their Facebook friends. News about the gifts can be shared on their Facebook timelines, and friends can redeem their gifts from a smartphone or printout from a computer.U.S. consumers will spend $110 billion on gift cards this year, with $3 billion coming from electronic gift cards, according to CEB TowerGroup. The research firm predicts that total gift card purchases will top $130 billion in 2015, with $16 billion coming from electronic gifting.Monday will be the biggest day of the year for digital gift card purchases, according to Transaction Wireless, a provider of multichannel digital gift card services.""As expected, we've already seen an uptick in digital gift card sales in the days leading up to Christmas, which is also a great indicator that Dec. 24 will be the peak of the season,"" Thomas Niedbalski, senior vice president of business and client development for Transaction Wireless, said in a press release Thursday.NPD's Cohen agrees. ""This is really going to be Virtual Gift Monday,"" he said.Digital ContentDemand for smartphone and tablet content is rising. People are increasingly sending family and friends electronic gift cards to buy games, videos, e-books and apps for their portable gadgets.Apple's iTunes Store, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google's (GOOG) Google Play are big in this market because they make the most popular mobile devices and run their own online stores. All offer electronic gift cards that can be used to buy anything in their download stores.Apple also lets customers give specific apps like games and content like music albums and movies using the ""Gift this"" button.Amazon lets users gift specific Kindle e-book titles. It also allows customers to personalize their electronic gift card emails with their own photos.Subscription ServicesAnother popular digital gifting area is subscriptions to online services.Consumers can order gift subscriptions to streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu Plus. Both services cost $7.99 a month for unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows. Netflix and Hulu have gift certificates for one to 12 months.If reading is more your style, Next Issue Media offers unlimited access to over 75 magazines, including back issues, on tablets for $9.99 a month. Gift subscriptions cover three-, six- and 12-month periods.Next Issue is a joint venture of five leading U.S.-based publishers — Conde Nast, Hearst, Meredith (MDP), News Corp. (NWS), and Time. Magazines include Esquire, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated, the New Yorker, Time, Vanity Fair, Vogue and Wired. The magazines can be read on Apple iPads and Google Android-based tablets.For music lovers, online radio service Pandora (P) offers gift subscriptions for its premium product, Pandora One. A one-year subscription to Pandora One costs $36. Unlike the free Pandora service, Pandora One is advertising-free and features higher-quality audio.For video game fans, GameFly, which delivers game discs by mail for all the top consoles, has electronic gift certificates for two to 12 months of service. GameFly gift certificates are available for up to 15% off the regular price of the service, which costs $22.95 a month.Online genealogy service Ancestry.com (ACOM) offers gift memberships for people interested in their family tree. The memberships start at $77 for six months. Ancestry is the world's largest online family history resource, with 2 million members and billions of searchable records.Angie's List (ANGI) is promoting gift memberships for people's Christmas lists. Angie's List provides online reviews of local service providers like roofers, plumbers, handymen, mechanics, doctors and dentists. Angie's basic service for home, lawn, auto and pet care providers costs $26 a year.
