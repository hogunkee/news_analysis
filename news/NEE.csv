3,NEE,"If you like ""The Odd Couple,"" May was your kind of market. A mix of technology stocks and defensive sectors outperformed. The tech stocks were driven by secular themes that seem able to keep growing even if the overall economy's growth is tepid.The S&P 500 gained 1.41% last month while U.S. diversified stock mutual funds inched ahead by a more modest 0.38%. Global science/technology funds and science-technology funds led sectors, advancing 5.88% on average and 4.69% respectively.Other leading sectors were more defensive. Utility funds gained 3.43% and international real estate funds tacked on 3.12%. Consumer goods funds also did well, growing 2.00%.""The technology sector did well because of across-the-board interest in cell phones, mobile devices and software,"" said Bernie Horn, a manager of $431.8 million Polaris Global Value Fund (PGVFX), an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, having outperformed the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years that ended Dec. 31.Some cloud computing leaders also added to tech's showing. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) posted gains. ""They are growing their cloud services dramatically,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has a solid 97 Composite Rating. It posted a 32.1% earnings surprise last quarter. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Defensive sectors also did well as investors sought safety amid doubts about the strength of economic growth. ""The market was having a debate,"" Chalupnik said. ""Investors aren't sure which way the economy is headed. The economic numbers that (came out) in May were mixed. The employment number was OK, but retail sales were a little light. The CPI (inflation rate) number was low for the second month in a row."" That last item is a sign that the U.S. economy is not heating up very fast.Precious metals funds, a defensive group, inched up 0.34% due to investor jitters over Washington, D.C., Horn said. ""The weekly hysteria over Trump comments regarding Russia tends to make some people think that the Federal Reserve may not be able to increase rates as expected,"" he said. ""That puts monetary policy into flux, which usually drives money into precious metals.""Large-cap growth funds gained 2.87%, leading U.S. diversified stock mutual fund categories.World equity funds easily topped U.S. stock funds with a 2.92% gain.Taxable bond funds inched up 0.64% on average. Tax-exempt funds tacked on 1.20%.Going forward, Horn expects stock markets to benefit from improving economic growth and diminished political drama. ""Notwithstanding political volatility around the world, underlying economic growth is slowly increasing,"" Horn said. ""And there's less of the uncertainty that was holding back individual and corporate spending. The U.S. elections, Brexit (the initial decision), the French election — all are in the past. The U.S. market has seen valuations rise. But outside the U.S., there are lots of great values.""Magna International (MGA), a Canada-based maker of car and truck parts, is one such name he likes. ""In an environment where competition among parts suppliers has been reduced, surviving companies like this are well-positioned to provide components whether the world goes electric or not,"" he said.And he still sees U.S. stocks that he likes. ""Quest Diagnostic (DGX) is the largest provider of medical tests in the country,"" Horn said. ""They're doing a better job of creating efficiencies in their operations, keeping costs in line.""He also likes NextEra Energy (NEE). ""It's one of the best-run utilities in the country if not the world, with a strong presence in clean fuels like natural gas and wind and solar to a lesser extent. It's not the cheapest stock, but management makes continuous improvements in their cost structure.""Horn also expects health insurers and managed care providers Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to benefit from the reduction of regulatory burdens of any arrangement that replaces or reforms ObamaCare.Chalupnik sees potential for better growth from key foreign markets than the U.S. Europe, China, Japan and emerging markets are growing at decent rates, he says. ""The whole global economy is growing together,"" he said. ""It's the first time since 2010 that you could say that.""His team has overweights in materials and industrials relative to the S&P 500, although it has trimmed its overweights. It has held its energy weighting steady.Detroit Edison (DTE) illustrates his appetite for energy. ""People and businesses still need electricity,"" he said. ""It is a very well run utility. It has good management, a good regulatory environment. It delivers quarter-in, quarter-out."" In addition, the stock has a 3% dividend yield.He also likes Wal-Mart Stores (WMT). ""It's a very stable company, probably the next big growth company out there. It's one of the few retailers that's growing same-store sales. And its e-commerce business is tremendous. And it's trading at an attractive multiple.""Share price is up 15% so far this year, including a 5% gain in May. But the stock has a weak 59 Composite Rating from IBD, on a scale from 1 to 99.Douglas Burtnick, a manager of $1.8 billion Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity (GSXIX), an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner for topping the S&P 500 over one, three, five and 10 years, likes Ellie Mae (ELLI). ""They sell software and services to banks, which help them create more efficiency around the mortgage origination process,"" he said.Ellie Mae's systems are helping to transform what has been a paper-oriented industry into a digitally focused one. ""That makes the process faster and easier,"" Burtnick said. ""Banks are willing to pay for that efficiency.""And Chalupnick likes the outlook for Lamb Weston (LW), a producer and distributor of frozen foods that was spun out of ConAgra (CAG) late last year. ""It is a relatively new company, and it is under-followed,"" he said. ""They are one of the few packaged-goods food companies that is growing its unit volume. General Mills unit volume is down (in its North American retail segment).""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Look For Winners In Industrials, Materials, Tech, BanksThe Painless Way To Add $140,000 To Your Retirement Account

6,NEE,"(In)Justice: We all know about President Obama's commutation of the 35-year sentence of traitor Chelsea Manning, nee Bradley, who handed U.S. secrets over to WikiLeaks, leading to the deaths of an untold number of people. That was bad enough.But even worse, but sadly less publicized, was Obama's decision to pardon Oscar Lopez Rivera, the terrorist whose FALN planted more than 130 bombs across America during the 1970s and 1980s, supposedly on behalf of Puerto Rican independence.Lopez Rivera was sentenced to 55 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and a number of weapons charges. He's served 35 years of that original sentence.What did he and the group he led actually do? As we noted, his group went on a two-decade bombing spree that led to the deaths of at least six and the wounding and maiming of many more. The worst attack came in 1975, when the FALN bombed the Fraunces Tavern, killing four and wounding more than 50 others.His supporters on the left, who always seem to make excuses for terrorists masquerading as Latin American ""revolutionaries,"" think he's served long enough. Lopez Rivera is 74, and has been in prison nearly half his life. He should be let out, they say.No he shouldn't.To begin with, in order for a lengthy sentence for such heinous crimes to have the desired deterrent effect, the entire sentence needs to be served — not reduced.It would be one thing if Lopez Rivera were repentant. But he isn't. Not a bit.He's been offered official chances to say he's sorry, to ask for forgiveness from those he harmed, but has refused. And he tried to escape twice, conspiring with others in one of the escape attempts to acquire explosives, grenades, guns and armor-piercing bullets. The threat was considered so severe that the court added 15 years to his original sentence. Sound repentant?Those who justify what Lopez Rivera did by calling him a ""freedom fighter"" or other such insulting nonsense are despicable. Yet, shamelessly, his far-left supporters lit up Twitter with their celebrations on Wednesday.Immediately after the news hit, New York's far-left Mayor Bill DeBlasio tweeted out: ""Thank you @#POTUS for freeing #OscarLopezRivera.""""Hamilton"" impresario Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeted, ""It'll be my honor to play Hamilton the night he goes.""Meanwhile, DeBlasio's political ally, New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who has long pushed for Lopez Rivera's release, likewise celebrated. ""#LaMarqueta was the place to be to celebrate @POTUS decision to free #OscarLopezRivera! Gracias @marquetaretona!""Meanwhile, in Chicago, President Obama's political ally and friend Bill Ayers, paying tribute to a fellow terrorist, tweeted his own salute: ""Oscar Lopez freed! Chelsea Manning out!!! Great news! Joy and Justice! Free Leonard (Peltier)! Pardon Ethel (Rosenberg)! Keep rolling!""Oh, you say, but it's only extremists who laud this terrorist murderer? Guess again. Then-President Bill Clinton in 1999 let many of the FALN members walk from prison and wanted to pardon Lopez Rivera, too, but he refused to renounce terrorism.In Congress, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., has for years lobbied hard to free Lopez Rivera. And, perhaps not surprisingly, serial-terrorist-dupe and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has joined the cause.The media are no better. CBS News in Chicago, the city where Lopez Rivera was arrested after having been found with six pounds of dynamite and blasting caps in his apartment, called him an ""activist"" in a web headline. NPR referred to Lopez Rivera in a headline as a ""Prisoner Who Fought For Puerto Rican Independence.""He bombed innocent men, women and children. He killed some, maimed others. That's not a ""fighter."" That's a coward.What never gets mentioned, however, is that Puerto Rico can be independent anytime it wants. Since 1966, the island commonwealth has held several votes on the issue. And independence has never won. Far from wanting independence, since a 2012 referendum most Puerto Ricans have favored statehood.The truth is, Lopez Rivera and his far-left followers were a group of Castro-wannabes, pursuing a Marxist revolution in Puerto Rico by bombing someone else's country and pretending to ""free"" people who didn't really want to be freed by them. They weren't freedom fighters, but rather extreme leftists who, if left to their own devices, would have offered Puerto Ricans the same form of state-imposed slavery that the Cubans still live under.They all deserved to serve their full terms in prison, but especially the remorseless Lopez Rivera. That he now gets out will only serve as an incentive to other terrorists. Please remember that the next time we have a domestic attack here in the U.S. Actions have consequences.By refusing to fight terrorism here at home, Obama has shown he doesn't care much about endangering American lives. Perhaps in that context, his release of unrepentant terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera shouldn't be surprising at all.RELATED:How Left's 'Terrorism' Narrative Threatens Americans' SecurityObama Funded Terrorism With His $1.7 Bil Ransom To IranThe Left's Dangerous Denial About Radical IslamWill Terrorist Attacks Be The New Normal?

7,NEE,"Loose wiring or faulty circuit can call for emergency repairs to your home electrical system. Right now, the chart action of utility funds is signaling the need for some immediate attention too.""Defensive sectors like utilities and telecom did pretty well earlier this year, but of late, investors have been warming up to higher growth sectors, technology in particular,"" said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research. She thinks stretched valuations in defensive sectors may be driving investors toward others that don't look too pricey too.Utility Select Sector SPDR (XLU) lost hundreds of millions in net outflow in each month of the third quarter, though it has grown assets this year to $7.31 billion.This bellwether exchange traded fund offers exposure to 28 electric and gas utilities as well as diversified power companies in the S&P 500. Its top holdings include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (SO). It yields 3.27%.XLU vaulted 15.5% in the first quarter amid investors' quest for safety and income. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, trudged up 1.4% in the same period.Now this utility ETF sits 10% below the early July high of 53.02 after losing support at key levels of short-term and long-term support over the past six trading sessions. Treasury yields jumped Tuesday on growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike later this year. That makes dividend-paying utilities relatively less attractive.Ari Wald, a senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., believes utilities could continue to be at risk. If the S&P continues its long-term advance, more cyclical sectors are likely to be rewarded.His firm downgraded the utility sector to underweight in August.IBD'S TAKE: Gold and rate-sensitive equity sectors have come under pressure as the outlook for the next Federal Reserve rate hike remains murky.Despite XLU's recent woes, or perhaps because of it, Wald thinks it has become tactically attractive. He finds the ETF is increasingly oversold and due for a bounce.""A rally back above the ETF's 200-day moving average at $48.50 would be an encouraging start,"" Wald told IBD on Monday. On the stock market today, XLU fell a further 2.1% to 47.29 -- its lowest level since April.Sector rotations are the hallmark of a healthy bull market, Wald added, because ""no sector becomes so extended to the upside or the downside to derail the market's broader advance.""Mishra sees another reason that utilities could be in favor again. She expects more volatility in the coming weeks as the presidential election approaches and the earnings season picks up pace. With the markets pricing in a Clinton victory, a tighter race and potential Trump win could trigger a broad market sell-off.""In such a scenario, I wouldn't be surprised to see some money moving back into defensive sectors until there is better visibility for the market,"" Mishra said.But she's not expecting a utilities rally like the one earlier this year, and she's bearish on the sector in the longer term.The Fed's latest signals have upped the odds of a hike in interest rates in December, she pointed out. Yield-bearing equity sectors, such as utilities and REITs, sell off when rates are rising.RELATED:Gold ETF Tumbles To Its Lowest Level Since Brexit Vote

8,NEE,"With growth stocks in favor, you'd think that high-yielding areas of the market would be going out of favor, but that's not entirely the case as several Utility Leaders are setting up for potential moves higher. Another is still in buying range.Utilities lagged Tuesday but have generally been acting well after Wall Street perceived the Fed to be more dovish than hawkish at the conclusion of last week's meeting.The Fed, as expected, left the federal funds rate unchanged, while longer-term rate projections showed a slower pace of increases. Policymakers now expect three rate hikes through the end of 2017, down from five at their June meeting.The Sept. 21 policy statement fueled a nice rally in interest-rate-sensitive utility stocks. SPDR Utility (XLU) jumped 2% in strong volume. However, on Tuesday, the popular ETF reversed off intraday highs, falling 1.3%, and sinking back below its 50-day moving average near 50.51.Consolidated Edison (ED) reclaimed its 10-week moving average last week as it works on a flat base with an 81.98 entry. It had the highest Accumulation/Distribution Rating in Tuesday's screen at A-. The rating, on a scale of A+ to E, is used to measure institutional buying and selling in a stock over the past three months. A+ signifies heavy institutional buy; E means heavy institutional selling.Consolidated Edison has paid a dividend of 67 cents a share for three straight quarters. It currently yields 3.4%.On a day when the Utility-Electric Power group fell around 1%, NextEra Energy (NEE) bucked the trend, rising 0.4%. It's also working on a flat base with a 132.08 buy point.NextEra pays a quarterly dividend of 87 cents a share, giving it an annualized yield of 2.8%.While many utilities are building bases, AES Corp. (AES) is in a slightly different boat because it's still in buy range after a breakout over a 12.82 buy point.The Virginia-based firm is another electric utility that pays a quarterly dividend of 11 cents a share, good for an annualized yield of 3.4% -- much better than the S&P 500's current yield of 2.07% as of Monday's market close.

9,NEE,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon. In the ""Buys & Sells"" column, Julie Mak points out that some leading mutual funds have been selling Alphabet and Amazon.Another plus for the tech sector is that acquisitions seem to be picking up, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformancePiantedosi says investors should brace for volatility until the elections. A Democratic White House, with the Senate and House in Republican hands would mean continued gridlock, he says. Still, his impression is that support for tax reform is growing in both parties. ""That would be a huge positive,"" he said.In health care, he's wary of many drugmakers due to political calls for price regulation. Still, he likes Celgene (CELG), Vertex (VRTX) and Biogen (BIIB).""Biotechs feel a little safer (than non-biotech drugmakers),"" he said. ""They are doing wonderful things to cure big diseases. They combine positive reward-to-risk. And they're beaten up and trading at valuations at attractive valuations.""Within retail, he likes a few names.""It's an area to watch as we head into the holidays, especially some more apparel-oriented stocks,"" Piantedosi said. ""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced. But he likes some names in health care, where prices have been pushed down.He calls Becton Dickinson (BDX), Medtronics (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ""quiet"" because none is under political pressure over drug pricing. Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge. Science-technology funds zoomed ahead 13.21% for the quarter on top of a 2.89% September gain.Health-biotechnology funds were also strong, manufacturing gains of 6.84% and 5.83% in the quarter.Small-cap growth funds gained 8.19% on average, leading all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.

11,NEE,"Stocks held onto moderate gains after the Federal Reserve stayed put on short-term interest rates. Fed officials signaled an even-slower rate hike path going forward, but still faster than markets are pricing in.In a statement issued at 2 p.m. ET, the central bank noted that the pace of improvement in the jobs market ""has slowed"" but also noted strengthening household spending, continued gains in the housing sector, while ""the drag from net exports appears to have lessened.""The Fed also noted that inflation is still short of its 2% long-term goal while business spending is still ""soft.""The major indexes are trying to snap a four-day losing streak. Meanwhile, big-cap techs showed mixed action, with Apple (AAPL) rising and Amazon.com (AMZN) letting early gains slip away. But clearly, based on stock chart action, the former is still in trouble and has not yet shown the kind of strong institutional buying that leads to the formation of new solid bases -- the stuff that ushers potential new breakouts to new highs. The latter, meanwhile, continues to be a member of IBD Leaderboard and its long-term uptrend remains firmly intact.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average briefly halved their pre-Fed gains, but are all back to 0.4% gains. That's a small fraction of each indexes' respective losses in recent days. The Nasdaq fell as much as 3.3% in the prior four days of trading, yet Tuesday's bounce off the pivotal 200-day moving average encouraged the bulls. The Dow transports gained 0.6% after the Fed news. The Dow utilities are down almost 0.2%.Volume on both major exchanges was still running lower vs. the same time Tuesday, but is likely to pick up into the close.The Fed raised interest rates in December by 25 basis points, the first hike since June 2006, yet has dithered since then on future increases in the cost of money due to worries about slowing growth in China, a poor May jobs report in the U.S. and economic uncertainty in many parts of Europe.From an industry-group perspective, metal ores, steel, coal and other metals-related stocks vied with apparel, fiber optic, jewelry and department store firms at the top of market's upside, while a host of utility shares fell 1% or more. NextEra Energy (NEE) slipped less than 1% to 124.30 in light trade; its rally since a late-January breakout past a 108.34 cup-with-handle base is still solid. It is in buy range from a 119.47 buy point from flat base.Apple edged 0.5% higher to 98.05 in light volume. While from a near-term perspective the iPhone maker has been trading between a band of 90 and 100, keep an eye on the falling 50- and 200-day moving averages. If the stock cannot rebound past these critical levels, it indicates a lack of greed among institutional players. The stock is simply too overly invested at this point to become a market leader like it was in the mid-2000s. As of the end of the first quarter, 4,844 mutual funds owned a stake in Apple, down from 4,922 funds in Q1 2015, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.Apple has a Composite Rating of 28 on a scale of 1 to 99; its 19 Relative Strength rating means it's underperforming 81% of all companies in IBD's stock database over the past 12 months.Among top-performing IBD 50 names in the stock market today, Dave & Buster's (PLAY) cooled off, down 2% to 47.49 in heavy volume. The innovative restaurant and game entertainment chain is still extended from a breakout past a 42.22 entry. It debuted on the Nasdaq at 16 in October 2014.As seen in Tuesday’s Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market’s current outlook was downgraded from “confirmed uptrend” to “uptrend under pressure.” This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower, given the increased intensity of professional selling. The Nasdaq composite saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to 4.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

13,NEE,"Mixed reality is about to get the ""Star Wars"" treatment. Walt Disney's (DIS) Lucasfilm ILMxLAB and Magic Leap announced a partnership Thursday at a Wired conference, teasing audiences with a mixed-reality video in which R2-D2 and C-3PO appear to be physically present in the room and fervently discussing how to escape a group of stormtroopers.Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Qualcomm (QCOM) were early investors in Magic Leap.Virtual reality and mixed reality (the latter layers projections on top of the real world) are still in early days, but legacy media entities clearly aren't hesitating to jump in. Disney also became an investor last year in cinematic VR company Jaunt VR, which consists of several Lucasfilm vets.Meanwhile, Chris Milk, the co-founder of VR startup Within (nee Vrse) announced Thursday — along with the name change — that the company was closing a Series A round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) also participated.Other notable media money in VR includes Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner's (TWX) investment units, which both participated in NextVR's $30.5 million Series A funding round last year.Does this mean that there are more partnership announcements to come? Maybe. VR is already a hot topic in gaming.At E3 2016 this week, virtual reality was a dominant theme. Microsoft (MSFT) teased its VR-capable Project Scorpio console, while Sony (SNE) gave PlayStation VR a formal release date, and Facebook's (FB) Oculus announced the release of 30 full VR games later this year.Shares of Disney finished 0.6% higher on the stock market today. Fox fell 1.1%.

"
16,NEE,"Five exchange traded funds in utilities stocks made new highs last week or are near new highs, as the sector emerges as a tempting alternative during the stock market's slump.With some of these ETFs in buy areas on their charts, investors have opportunities to invest in one of the few areas showing solid price action.Utility stocks weakened in April, as bond yields spiked. That was an unwelcome development for utilities because higher rates increase capital costs for an industry that constantly has to spend on plants and equipment. Also, higher bond yields can make utilities' dividends less attractive by comparison.But as Treasury yields started falling, utility ETFs reacted with gains in the past two weeks.The profit outlook for utilities is relatively favorable. The sector's combined profit is expected to drop 2% for the first quarter but rise about 4% for the full year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. By both measures, earnings will be well above the S&P's total but below better-performing sectors such as consumer discretionary and health care.The sector's most popular ETF is Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which trades an average of more than 17 million shares a day. It has climbed back above its 50-day moving average and is near a new high. IShares U.S. Utilities (IDU) has traced a similar chart.Thinly traded PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum (PUI) broke out of a flat base Wednesday and is in buy range from a 25.63 entry. The fund, which is diversified among various types of utility companies, is based on an index that emphasizes utility stocks showing relative strength, which helps explain its move to new highs.Some of DWA Utilities' top components hit new highs in the past week, including DTE Energy (DTE), WEC Energy (WEC) and American Water Works (AWK). Also, Westar Energy (WR) made a new closing high.Vanguard Utilities (VPU) touched a new high Thursday after finding support around the 50-day moving average. Investors can use that support to purchase shares. But ideally, investors would use the March breakout past a 102.68 buy point to buy the bulk of shares and use the pullback to add a smaller amount.Vanguard Utilities and Fidelity MSCI Utilities (FUTY) are both based on the same index: The MSCI U.S. Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index.The index is more heavily weighted on Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE) and Southern Co. (SO), with each representing 6% to 7% of the total fund. In fact, Utilities Select Sector SPDR and iShares U.S. Utilities (based on the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index) also have the same companies as top components. NextEra broke out Wednesday but is back below the 119.47 buy point.                   The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

All but 4 of its 29 stock holdings advanced.Top holding NextEra (NEE) was among the declining stocks. Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co.

22,NEE,"It was another bad day in the stock market Monday, but a few hearty stocks held up. Utility stocks continue to lead the market.Utility stocks are defensive in nature. Many mutual funds and hedge funds turn to them in hard times on the theory they will decline less than other stocks. Also, a healthy dividend could soften blows to stock price.The two big telcos, Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) were holding up with only minor declines in Monday's selling. Right now, Verizon is talking up its plans for a faster 5G network.AT&T was still near a 36.55 buy point of saucer base. But individual investors would do well to think twice during a correction. A money manager might be required to hold stocks or be fully invested. An individual has a big advantage. He or she can ride out a bear market in the safety of cash, and ready to jump in once a new bull market.Once a new uptrend begins, utilities usually underperform.Verizon is in a similar position. A cheery earnings report Jan. 21 kicked off a rally that has brought the stock near a 50.96 buy point from long consolidation.Of the two, Verizon has shown the better growth with a five-year annualized growth rate of 15%. But AT&T has put up decent numbers the past few quarters. Verizon has a 4.4% annualized yield, but AT&T has 5.2%.WEC Energy (WEC) remained above a 53.98 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, and its outperformance over the past few weeks has caused its relative strength line to go nearly vertical, a bullish sign.WEC provides electricity to customers in Wisconsin and Michigan. The stock briefly made a marginal new high Monday, but a falling market pushed it lower.It pays an annualized yield of 3.2%. Its relative strength line is also bolting sharply higher.Southern Co. (SO) is forming the right side of a new base and might now be forming a handle. The company provides electricity states in the South and Southeast. Its annualized yield is 4.5%, although its five-year annualized growth rate is just 4%, south of some of the faster growing utilities.NextEra Energy (NEE) operates in two units. Florida Power & Light provides electricity in Florida, where it's one of the nation's largest regulated electric utilities. NextEra Energy Resources produces wholesale electricity from clean sources, such as natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear.It's extended from 105.95 early entry and also sports a very strong relative strength line. The annualized dividend yield is 2.7% and the five-year annualized growth rate is 6%.
"
23,NEE,"Several of the largest sector and industry ETFs have been mauled by the bear recently.Alerian MLP (AMLP) sits 45% below its 52-week high, putting it firmly in bear market territory. It invests in energy-focused master limited partnerships, typically midstream, pipeline companies.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) is trading 34% off its old high.Then there's Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), a defensively oriented exchange traded fund.Think of it as your bear pepper spray for tough markets. It's worth considering an overweight to utility companies, especially since the broad-market ETF such as SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) that you may already own only has a 3% stake in the sector.XLU has gained 5.7% year to date through Feb. 17 vs. a 5.4% loss for SPY.So far in 2016, AMLP stumbled 18% and IBB tumbled 21%.Meanwhile, XLU hit a new 52-week high of 47 last week as the broad market was sinking. It has a Relative Strength Rating of 85, which means it is outgunning 85% of the stocks and ETFs in the IBD database.That momentum helped it earn a place on the elite IBD Leaderboard, becoming the first ETF to do so.Leaderboard holds stocks with stellar technical and fundamental factors, which offer investors the most potential for the biggest gains. Only three other stocks made that list Thursday -- AT&T (T), Ross Stores (ROST) and Reynolds American (RAI).XLU led these peers with a 2% gain on the stock market today. Along the way, it reclaimed a 46.24 buy point and formed a new handle area with a 47.10 entry. Shares are in a buy range.The $7.62 billion ETF last broke out of a base, on Oct. 24, 2014. Investors who jumped on that opportunity pocketed a 12% gain if they sold when XLU peaked at 49.78 three months later.Keep in mind that while breakouts from sound bases often lead to substantial gains, breakouts can fail. So among wise investors' sell rules are those that will help them cut any losses short.XLU offers broad exposure to 29 high-yielding utility companies in the S&P 500. As such, it has a large- and midcap skew.Top holdings include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (SO)The utilities sector is one of the steadiest segments of the market.""This fund has been less volatile than the broader market because of the sector's generally stable cash flows and lower sensitivity to economic cycles,"" Robert Goldsborough, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a recent report.However, the sector could get hurt if the Fed stays on track with its proposed four interest-rate hikes this year.""Higher rates generally make fixed-income instruments more attractive on a relative basis and make bond-like equities, such as utilities companies, less attractive,"" Goldsborough said.XLU has a 0.14% expense ratio and a 3.5% yield.It's the top-performing utility ETF year to date.

27,NEE,"The major averages were holding near their intraday highs late Friday afternoon, but investors remained cautious following a weak GDP report.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.8%, the S&P 500 added 1.7%, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%. But volume in the stock market today was running below Thursday's levels with about an hour left in the trading session.The economy grew at a 0.7% annual rate in the fourth quarter, below analysts' expectations for a 0.9% gain. The weak reading suggested that the Federal Reserve would move slowly to increase interest rates further, which in turn spurred broad-based stock gains. The Bank of Japan's decision to adopt a negative interest-rate policy also bolstered the market. On the NYSE, advancers were leading decliners by 6 to 1 in late trading.However, there were signs of caution, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling and gold rising as investors sought a safe haven from the market's recent turmoil. Also, defensive stocks such as utilities and food producers continued to fare well.Aqua America (WTR), a Pennsylvania-based provider of water and wastewater services, jumped more than 2%, clearing a 31.19 buy point of a flat base in heavy volume.NextEra Energy (NEE), a Florida-based electricity provider, rose more than 2% to a new high in strong turnover.On Friday, the water and electric utility industry groups were ranked No. 2 and No. 9, respectively, out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD.Facebook (FB) was among few growth stocks that have cleared buy points recently. The IBD Leaderboard stock jumped nearly 3% in double its average daily turnover, breaking out past a 110.75 entry in a new base. The social media giant has soared since it reported strong fourth-quarter profit and revenue growth after Wednesday's market close.Amazon.com (AMZN) didn't fare as well. The Internet retailer plunged 8% after posting weaker-than-expected quarterly results.

32,NEE,"A little more than a month ago, only one stock was in IBD's Utility Leaders screen. Today, the list has expanded to about a half dozen and includes the one that never left: NextEra Energy (NEE).In February, NextEra raised its quarterly dividend to $1.11 per share. The increase was part of a goal to boost the cash payout 12% to 14% annually through 2020. The initial target was to continue increases through this year, but the company extended it two years.On an annualized basis, the yield is 2.8%. IBD calculates a healthy long-term annual dividend growth rate of 10%.The stock is in buy range from the 159.74 buy point of a breakout on March 16. NextEra shares have seen little follow-through from that entry, but no sell signal. Compared with other utility stocks, it's a great performance. Most of the sector has been beaten up since November. Even the highest-rated utility stocks remain in price corrections.Expectations of higher bond yields — which compete with utility dividends — are one reason for the underperformance. Unseasonably mild February temperatures hurt electricity demand, too. In a shift, many parts of the U.S. have been unusually cold this month.Trading in NextEra could change sharply Tuesday, when the company reports first-quarter earnings before the market's open. Analysts expect earnings of $1.84 a share, up 5%, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales are expected to rise 5% to $4.16 billion.The company suffered massive losses last year in Hurricane Irma, and management may update those costs in Tuesday's report. In the fourth-quarter report, NextEra said it used savings from the corporate tax cut to offset about $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma costs. The company said that saved the average customer $250.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

35,NEE,"Quality, cleanliness and service. Those are core values on which Harry and Esther Snyder built In-N-Out Burger, the regional fast-food chain that counts celebrity chefs Gordon Ramsey and Thomas Keller among its rabid fans.In-N-Out’s star burns even brighter outside the limelight.With annual sales of over $750 million and a per-store average of over $2 million, In-N-Out’s per-store figures beat those of high-profile national chains.In-N-Out started in 1948 as a tiny hamburger stand in the Baldwin Park suburb of Los Angeles.It now boasts 309 locations in California, Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona and Oregon.Despite pleas from customers and Wall Street, In-N-Out has resisted an IPO and franchising, preferring a steady expansion that lets it maintain a close watch on each store’s product and execution.It all goes back to quality, cleanliness, service, “the formula that emerged for the standard of running In-N-Out,” wrote Stacy Perman in “In-N-Out Burger: A Behind-the-Counter Look at the Fast-Food Chain That Breaks All the Rules.” “It was not based on some fancy management methodology — rather, it grew out of Harry’s own instincts and exacting personality.”Harry Snyder (1913-76) was born in Vancouver, British Columbia.He had a hard-scrabble upbringing in Seattle and Santa Monica, Calif., often working odd jobs to help support his parents and older sisters in the wake of his father’s usual unemployment.Not one to hit the books, Harry possessed a strong work ethic. He spent his World War II Army deployment in a series of desk jobs due to a perforated ear drum. After the war in 1945, he worked as a caterer at Fort Lawton in Seattle.Esther Snyder (1920-2006), nee Johnson, also grew up in challenging circumstances, as one of eight children in rural Illinois. Unlike Harry, Esther made a college degree a priority.Working part time and taking care of her ill grandmother, she received a teaching certificate and then enrolled in the women’s arm of the Naval Reserve during World War II.After the war, she moved to Seattle, where she finished her bachelor’s degree in zoology from Seattle Pacific University.At 27, she was managing a restaurant in Fort Lawton where she met Harry, 34. Love struck fast, and they married in 1948. Then it was off to Los Angeles to start their new life, also in the food arena.The pair settled in fast-growing Baldwin Park near Los Angeles.While at Fort Lawton, Harry had noticed the increasing popularity of the boxed lunches he delivered. In L.A., he saw the postwar appetite for independence and pleasure and imagined the car becoming a larger aspect of California life.He noticed that Baldwin Park had few restaurants, yet was on a busy route between L.A. and Palm Springs -- a perfect spot for a hamburger stand.The practical Snyders named it In-N-Out to evoke car culture convenience. Harry received $5,000 startup capital from local businessman Charles Noddin and opened the first store in October 1948 on Garvey Avenue, across from the home he shared with Esther.Adding spark to his concept, Harry developed a two-way radio ordering system that let customers get a quick meal without leaving their cars.More than high tech, the high quality of the burgers and fries kept customers coming back.Harry inspected each produce shipment and made sure lettuce was hand-leafed, with tomatoes and onions up to par.Esther formed the day’s patties each morning. At home, she kept a close eye on the books while Harry supervised the stand.Soon, Esther's workload grew with the addition of their two sons, Guy and Rich. Leaving the day-to-day operations to Harry, she continued to do the bookkeeping and always stopped by the store to check in with employees and let them know how important they were to In-N-Out’s burgeoning success.The Snyders' combination of street and book smarts helped create a simple yet exceptional experience. Lines of happy customers around the block became a daily occurrence. After three years, in 1951, In-N-Out opened a second location in nearby Covina.Noddin and Harry soon dissolved the partnership after the former pushed to cut costs by reducing employee pay and using cheaper ingredients. Harry vowed to never again take on outside financing.Harry didn’t dream of putting an In-N-Out on every corner. His goal was to create a sustainable and healthy business to pass on to his sons.He knew a healthy business could be achieved only if his associates felt respected and cared for.From the beginning, Harry and Esther paid associates above minimum wage. Vendors received the same treatment. The Snyders always paid invoices on time.They didn’t cut corners and expected the same treatment from their employees and vendors.If a produce vendor was caught sneaking subpar product into a shipment, Harry ended their relationship on the spot.Employees were so satisfied working at In-N-Out, many didn’t want to leave even though they had plateaued in their positions.Meanwhile, the Snyders continued to expand, in large part to provide professional opportunities to those who helped build the firm.Harry and Esther did so under two conditions: (1) They had to own a building outright. (2) They had to know who would manage it.In-N-Out grew in the 1950s and ’60s with its traditional look and ethos -- perhaps a reassuring presence during huge cultural shifts.“There’s something very appealing about ‘No surprises.’ When you walked in, you knew you were going to be taken care of,” Michael Stern, co-author of “Roadfood,” told IBD.In the mid-1960s, Harry invested in the Irwindale Raceway, a now-defunct drag strip, and had In-N-Out provide event food.After visitors from other parts of the country tasted their first In-N-Out burger at the L.A.-area track, they took glowing reports far and wide. That made the eatery more than a West Coast secret, and requests to franchise grew.In 1976, Harry died at age 63 from lung cancer. In-N-Out had grown to 18 locations in Southern California, and 24-year-old Rich became its new president. The young man was committed to preserving his parents’ commitment to quality, service and cleanliness.With the help of industry mentors and the blessing of Esther, who maintained the position of secretary-treasurer, Rich expanded In-N-Out at a faster clip.In order to grow while maintaining the company’s core values, he came up with two innovations.The first was In-N-Out University, a training facility that opened in 1984. The school taught the management practices that Harry standardized in the early years. Rich “started videotaping employees, and they would review the tapes (during training) to discuss performance, a practice Rich picked up from the NFL,” Perman said.The second was a customer care line, a toll-free phone system staffed by those who had worked at In-N-Out restaurants.During the 1980s, Esther continued her day-to-day involvement in the chain’s operations while increasing philanthropic activities.In 1984, the company began supporting causes to help abused and neglected children, leading to the In-N-Out Burger Foundation.In 1992, In-N-Out opened its first store outside of California — in Las Vegas. But the next year, tragedy struck. Rich died when his plane crashed on the way home from a store opening in Fresno, Calif.Guy, who had worked at In-N-Out but struggled with substance abuse, stepped in as president.By many accounts, Guy demonstrated a talent for updating quality controls. But in 1999, he died from a drug overdose.In-N-Out had grown from those 18 stores when Harry died to a chain of 140 stores in two states.At nearly 80, Esther finally assumed the presidency.She remained the emotional center of the firm, visiting stores and checking on employees regularly.Lynsi Snyder, Guy’s daughter and the only member of the family’s third generation, was only 17 at the time of her father’s death.After high school, she assumed various roles in the company and moved toward the top.After Esther died at age 86, Mark Taylor rose from vice president of operations to the presidency.Then in 2010, Lynsi finally took the helm.The operating procedures instilled by Harry and Esther continue to resonate with customers.In 2015, In-N-Out won Nation’s Restaurant News’ top consumer pick for a limited-service chain for the third year in a row.Meanwhile, Lynsi Snyder-Ellingson is following in her grandparents’ footsteps. The new owner has said she will pass the company to her four children.Built In-N-Out Burger from a hamburger stand to 300-plus location chain.

64,NEE,"The long-running bankruptcy saga of Energy Future Holdings is coming to a close now that Texas has approved the sale of the company's crown jewel.X The Texas Public Utility Commission authorized Sempra Energy's (SRE) $9.45 billion purchase of Oncor Electric Delivery, the state's largest utility, on Thursday. It was the last major step needed to end the almost four-year-old Energy Future bankruptcy, which rivaled Enron's as the largest ever for an energy company. A bankruptcy court approved Oncor's sale last month.""It's the end of a long and twisting road,"" said Paul Patterson, a utility analyst for Glenrock Associates. ""Sempra was able to prevail over several suitors.""Hit by a collapse in natural gas prices, Energy Future was forced to sell Oncor, one of the most sought-after U.S. utilities, as it worked to restructure almost $50 billion in debt. Sempra beat out Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), NextEra Energy (NEE) and a group backed by Hunt Consolidated, which all tried and failed to buy the utility in recent years. Berkshire took a pretax loss of $837 million on a $2 billion Energy Future debt investment in 2013, and Buffett has called it ""a big mistake,"" saying he wishes he'd never heard of the company.""Sempra Energy is committed to being a good partner for the state and is supportive of Oncor's mission to provide Texans with safe, reliable and affordable electric service,"" said Debra L. Reed, chairwoman, president and CEO of Sempra Energy, who called the approval a ""significant milestone.""PUC Chairman DeAnn Walker thanked Sempra for agreeing to conditions that the agency required for an Oncor sale. Attendees at the meeting in Austin, Texas, broke out in applause as the three-member commission voted to approve the transaction after many failed attempts.""It's so appropriate for a round of applause for all the work that has gone into this,"" Commissioner Brandy Marty Marquez said. ""It's been enormous.""Dallas-based Oncor offers steady, regulated returns in a state with a growing population and the highest electricity sales in the country. Oncor is Texas' largest transmission operator, managing about 134,000 miles (216,000 kilometers) of power lines that deliver electricity to about 10 million customers.Sempra runs power and gas utilities in Southern California, Chile and Peru that together serve more than 32 million consumers, according to the company's website. It also owns and operates almost 2,400 megawatts of renewable energy capacity with partners.""They like Texas,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige said of Sempra. ""It's obviously the center of the energy industry.""Before the bankruptcy, Energy Future was the target of the largest-ever leveraged buyout, when it was taken private for $48 billion in 2007 by a group led by KKR & Co.

UnitedHealth (UNH), Best Buy (BBY), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and others are stocks to watch as they may be setting up for new breakout moves when a stronger market rally returns.During a market pullback like we've seen recently, leading stocks will often consolidate prior gains and form new chart patterns, such as a flat base or cup with handle.Other stocks, like alcohol distributor Constellation Brands (STZ) or Famous Footwear owner Calares (CAL), will try to break out but hit resistance.Bottom line: The time to build your list of stocks to watch is when the market is under selling pressure or in a correction. The list below includes several potential breakout stocks that could be poised to pop when a stronger uptrend resumes.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHeavy buying by the top fund managers has already helped drive breakouts for stocks like E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Insperity (NSP), Integra Lifesciences (IART) and USANA Health Science (USNA). On Thursday, Abiomed (ABMD) joined that list by bolting higher on earnings and is now out of buy range.But the list of new buys (see link below) also includes several stocks still in or near a potential buy zone.Electronics retail giant Best Buy is working on a second-stage consolidation. The conventional buy point is 78.69, but it's also showing a more aggressive 77.42 entry. Heading into the final hour of trading Friday, Best Buy is up around 2% to 76.57.UnitedHealth is building a first-stage flat base with a 250.89 entry, while Charles Schwab is trying to complete a later-stage pattern. Schwab was named one of IBD's Best Online Brokers for 2018. Schwab is up over 2% Friday, while UnitedHealth is flirting with a 1% gain.Constellation Brands, which distributes Corona beer and a range of other alcoholic beverages, has pulled back below the 231.93 buy point it initially cleared on April 17. See if the stock can find support at its 50-day line and retake the entry in strong volume. Constellation is falling further below that benchmark line in afternoon trading Friday.Defense sector stock Flir Systems (FLIR) is trading at the very upper end of a 51.80 to 54.39 buy zone after breaking out last month.

69,NEE,"Investors showed a little bit of fear about the prospects for four, and not three, quarter-point rate hikes following the first testimony to Congress by new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell, with stocks trading solidly lower heading into the final half hour.Powell said in prepared remarks that the U.S. central bank ""will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheating economy and bringing ... price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis.""Meanwhile, top growth stock Arista Networks (ANET) just edged lower Tuesday afternoon after retaking its key 50-day moving average on Monday. The software-centric data center networking gear specialist was down 0.2%, far better than the broader market.Arista, which reported stellar Q4 results a little more than a week ago (EPS up 64%, revenue up 43%, net margin of 29.3%, up 670 basis points vs. a year ago), needs to try to form a new base after triggering a sell signal Feb. 16. Shares are just 16% below an all-time high of 311.67, when the stock had a market cap of just over $23 billion.Arista has a reasonable float of 74 million shares, much smaller than the 4.77 billion share float of its arch rival Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco is having a super 2018 so far, up 18% year to date and rising more than 32% since clearing a shallow saucer with handle at 34.20 on Oct. 20.A saucer with handle has some of the aspects of a great cup with handle, but generally shows a more shallow look, even if the decline from high to low exceeds 30%. Plus, the large amount of time that it takes to form this winning stock chart pattern tends to wear investors out rather than shake them out.The Nasdaq composite eased 0.8%, giving back a chunk of its 2.9% advance over the prior two sessions. The tech-centered index was down as much as 1% earlier in the session. The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.9% as it experiences resistance near 7000 for the second time in nearly five weeks.The S&P 500 fell 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.7%. Strength in some industrial, tech and commodity-type components within the 30-stock Dow industrials helped blunt the decline.Homebuilders fell hard as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond jumped back above the 2.90% level and bond prices halted a three-session win streak. Toll Bros. (TOL) swung from a nice early gain to fall nearly 5% to 45.45 in heavy trade. Watch to see if the luxury homebuilder can form a new base. Revenue rose 28% in the January-ended fiscal first quarter to $1.18 billion, notching the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters as adjusted earnings jumped 52%.Elsewhere in the stock market today, utilities continued to serve as the caboose as the Dow utility average fell another 1.3%. At 675, the 15-stock index remains more than 13% off its November 2017 peak of 778.Among those 15 stocks, NextEra Energy (NEE) has been hanging relatively tough. The Juno Beach, Fla.-based utility dropped 1.7% to 152.07 and slid back below its 50-day moving average. However, as seen in a daily chart on MarketSmith, the stock found nice institutional buying support at the slower-moving, long-term 200-day moving average earlier this month.Watch to see if NextEra can keep its head above the 200-day line, which would be bullish.The large-cap firm has an annualized dividend yield of 2.9%, vs. less than 1.8% for the S&P 500. (Track the S&P 500's yield each day by going to the large-cap index's chart on the General Market Indicators PDF link at the bottom of every Big Picture column.)Four more companies to watch as growth and income plays are Blackstone Group (BX), Helmerich & Payne (HP), Pfizer (PFE) and Toronto Dominion Bank (TD). All four are currently in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen because they sport good yields, have excellent annual earnings stability, and long-term dividend growth (ranging from 2% annually for Toronto Dominion to 11% for Blackstone and Helmerich & Payne).Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportRELATED:Who Are The Next IPO Stock Gems?Also In Stock Market Today: Dow Leads Upside As These 11 Industry Groups Rally 12% Or More In 2018Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWhere To Find IBD's Dividend Stock Leaders

83,NEE,"Stocks got slammed again Friday, as a major reversal sent key market index funds crashing to cap a very bad week.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) plunged 2.3%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) sank 2% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 1.6% in the stock market today. SPY fell to its 200-day moving average.On the Dow, Nike and Boeing held slim gains after rising 3% each intraday. They were the only two advancers. Athletic shoe giant Nike reported quarterly results late Thursday that topped views and offered a bullish outlook. But DowDuPont (DWDP), 3M (MMM) and Pfizer (PFE) lost more than 3% apiece.Big-cap techs showed continued weakness: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) each fell 2% or more. Apple extended its slide for a sixth straight session and is now 10% off its high.Banks, semiconductor ad technology led the downside among sector funds. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) tumbled 3% to take out its 50-day moving average. Dow component Intel fell 2.7%, while graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) slid nearly 4% and rolled back below its 50-day line for the second time this week. Micron Technology (MU), which reported earnings late Thursday, was down nearly 8%.Investors flocked to a safe haven Thursday as technology and most other sectors got routed amid heightened trade war fears.Most equity ETFs saw losses. But Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) held on for a 0.4% gain and even managed to close above its 50-day moving average. The defensive ETF has been testing that support line the past week. When the market is in confirmed uptrend, a rebound off the 50-day can set up a potential buy opportunity. But when the uptrend is under pressure, all buys are at greater risk than usual.Also note that since late January, the 50-day line has been below the 200-day line. That's a bearish sign. However, the big tech sell-off begs the question: Is sector rotation occurring? Utilities and other defensive sectors tend to outperform when high-growth areas like tech underperform.XLU may also be shaping the bottom of a base as it continues to consolidate near the 50-day. The ETF is currently 13% off its 52-week high.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

84,NEE,"Electricity consumption tied to Bitcoin and other digital currencies on computer networks could give a boost to some U.S. utilities and create partnership opportunities for renewable energy developers, says a Morgan Stanley report.""Though the overall impact from increased demand seems minimal at this time, the key utility beneficiaries we would highlight include: American Electric Power (AEP), Xcel Energy (XEL), and Entergy (ETR),"" Nicholas Ashworth, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a report to clients published Wednesday. ""These utilities serve the regions with the lowest cost of electricity, and American Electric Power and Xcel are taking advantage of low-cost wind (power) to drive rates even lower.""""There is also the potential for wind and solar developers, we would highlight NextEra Energy (NEE) and Pattern Energy (PEGI), to get involved in supplying 'firm' renewable power solutions to concentrated mining operations,"" Ashworth added.Digital currency transactions require energy-intensive computer networks. A public ledger, called a blockchain, provides a record of where every digital token was first ""mined"" using computing power. For Bitcoin, verifying a transaction and adding it to the blockchain earns a miner a specific number of bitcoins.By design, Bitcoin mining software makes it very expensive — in terms of computing power and electricity — to add new blocks. Cryptocurrency power use is facing more scrutiny, particularly in China, where officials are concerned miners are taking advantage of low electricity prices.Some parts of the U.S. — such as the Midwest and Northwest — could also offer mining networks low power costs, Ashworth said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.""Electricity consumption from Bitcoin in 2018 could be as great as we forecast for global electric vehicles in 2025,"" Morgan Stanley added.""However in theory Bitcoin's energy usage should decline in the long run. The network is designed to produce one block every ten minutes, regardless of energy use. The Bitcoin reward for mining a block however halves every four years — the next time is in 2020. If it becomes unprofitable to mine, then in theory less mining will occur.""RELATED:Is Resistance In These 2 Stocks A Warning For Chip-Sector Investors?Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetJust How Many More 'Blockchain Pretenders' Could 2018 Bring?Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

159,NEE,"JinkoSolar Holding Company Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) recently announced that will supply 86 megawatt (MW) of solar modules to Colombia’s largest Photovoltaic (PV) Plant. Per the terms of the deal, Jinko Solar’s 250,000 Monocrystalline Standard Modules with the capacity of 345 Watt – 1500 V will generate 176 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of clean energy on average every year.JinkoSolar as a Global Solar Module SupplierChina-based JinkoSolar offers solar modules, solar system integration services and photovoltaic products in the global market. Of late, the company has singed a few agreements with international companies to supply solar modules. In June , JinkoSolar’s U.S.-based subsidiary entered into a three-year agreement with sPower — an affiliate of AES Corp (AES  -  Free Report) — to supply 13 gigawatt (GW) high-efficiency solar modules.In March, JinkoSolar signed an agreement to supply 2.75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report).  It has also supplied 275.4 Megawatt-dc (MWdc) high-efficiency solar modules to Green Light Contractors Pty Ltd. for the Bungala solar project in Australia. These contracts along with the latest one indicate the growing popularity and acceptance of JinkoSolar’s modules in the global solar market.Prospects in ColombiaWith the world making a dramatic shift to adopting renewables as their desired source for energy generation in order to reduce carbon emission, Colombia is fast catching up. In this context it is imperative to mention that the Colombian government’s Generation and Transmission Expansion Plan 2015-2029 projects expansion of 4,208 to 6,675 MW in the nation’s renewable resources over the said period.Meanwhile solar, being the least expensive alternative power generation option combined with improved technology, has emerged as a key area in the renewable space. Considering Colombia’s renewables expansion plan for the next decade, we believe JinkoSolar has wider opportunities to sell modules in the country, which in turn should bolster growth.Price MovementJinkoSolar’s shares have gained 15.5% in the past month outperforming the industry’s rise of 5.6%. The upside can be attributed to the recent international module supply deals signed by the company. Zacks Rank & Another Key PickJinkoSolar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

161,NEE,"American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Pennsylvania American Water has received directive from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to pass on the tax savings benefits resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to customers.The new act became effective Jan 1, 2018 and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This move will lead to reduction of about $47 million annually in the federal income tax that Pennsylvania American Water will pay to the government.Quality Service at Low PricesThe tax-cut savings will allow the residential customers of Pennsylvania American Water to enjoy safe and reliable services at a very competitive price.For water customers who typically use 5,000 gallons per month, the savings will be $5.27 or $63.24 per year, while wastewater customers, who typically use 5,000 gallons per month, will encounter savings of $6.58, or $78.96 per year.Tax Cuts — A Blessing for CustomersUtilities in some states are directed by the utility commission for implementing tax cuts to lower customers’ bills. Utilities are passing on the benefits to their customer base either through reduction in existing utility service rates or by adjusting their planned rate increases.Passing on tax savings does not look significant when we consider a single user or a single utility, however, it is significant when we consider the nation as a whole. Decisions have already been taken to pass on more than billions of dollars in tax savings to customers and we expect this amount to increase further.Recently, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) decided to pass on $142 million in tax savings to lower utility bills of Indiana-based customers if the proposed settlement is approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.Another utility, NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) has decided to use tax savings of nearly $1.3 billion to recoup the storm-recovery expenses, without increasing its users’ bills in Florida.Price MovementAmerican Water Works’ shares have returned 11.5% in the past year, outperforming the 1.7% growth of the  industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderCurrently, American Water Works has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

162,NEE,"PG&E Corporation’s (PCG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), sought approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for four energy storage projects. The projects will have a combined capacity of 567 megawatts (MW).If approved, the first one of this storage is expected to come online by end of 2019 and the rest will be operational by 2020.Importance of Battery StorageThe trend of storing energy is gradually finding recognition. Energy storage helps to increase the resilience of the grid and enable companies to cater to higher demand during lower production of electricity. Excess energy produced from renewable sources are generally stored in the battery and are used during high demand, which lessens the production of electricity from fossil fuel.  Unlike the fossil fuel, alternate energy sources are dependent on weather conditions that make storage of energy essential. Battery storage lowers emission as it cuts dependence on fossil fuel-based production.Increasing Usage of Battery Storage in Utility SpacePer the release by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), at the end of 2017, 708 MW of power capacity which represents 867 MWh of energy capacity of large-scale, battery storage capacity was in utilization. The number of large-scale batteries, based on lithium-ion chemistries, is 80%. PG&E’s three third-party owned projects are also lithium-ion battery projects.Utilities are shifting to renewables through the replacement of coal by natural gas and clean energy, realizing the need of emission less environment. Large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and National Grid plc (NGG  -  Free Report) investing in battery storage projects. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the United States, considering higher production of electricity from renewable sources.Zacks Rank & Price MovementPG&E carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

163,NEE,"Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) will pass on an amount of $142 million in annual tax savings to the electric bills of its Indiana-based customers, if the proposed settlement with consumer groups is approved by Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — amended in late 2017 — came into effect on Jan 1, 2018 and has clearly led to this entire bill reduction.Details of Tax SavingsThe company’s customers, particularly residing in Indiana, would save approximately $142 million in annual tax on their electric bills. The company is expected to reach an agreement to impart the tax savings to its consumers via a slashed electric rate over the next two years. The new Federal Tax Laws will lower the overall customer’s electricity bill.After considering the effect of lower tax rate, reduction in base rate and refunds of accumulated deferred taxes, the company will witness an average rate reduction of 5.6% by 2020 with most savings beginning in 2018. The actual amount of tax saving will tend to vary according to the different customer class. An average residential customer with consumption of 1,000 kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity per month will save approximately $7.33 on the monthly electric bill from the downward revision in electricity rates.Benefits of the Tax ReformThe latest tax reform has resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and lately, various companies are passing on this benefit to their customers, decreasing utility rates and bills. Duke Energy is also no exception on this front and has probably curbed its electricity charges to reward its customers with tax savings.Also, in recent times, we witnessed some other utilities having directed the federal tax savings to reduce bills for customers. These are Avangrid, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings Inc .Notably, this rate reduction is in line with the company’s earlier-made recommendation on the fourth-quarter earnings call. It made clear about using lower tax rates to curtail utility rates for customers in the near-term as well as aid in offsetting the future rate increases.Price MovementIn the last three months, shares of Duke Energy have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

167,NEE,"WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) has recently signed an agreement to acquire majority stake at the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center of Henry County, Illinois. Per the terms, WEC Energy will purchase 80% ownership of the wind farm for $148 million.Developed by Invenergy, the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center has a capacity to generate 132 megawatt (MW) of electricity and been in service since May 2018.  Utility’s Shift to RenewablesRising level of air pollution along with global climate change has prompted consumers to rapidly increase the adoption of alternative energy sources, nay renewables, over the last decade. Buoyed by declining costs of solar and wind technologies as well as rising demand for more carbon-constrained practices, utilities and corporations are shifting to renewables. Consequently, many electric utilities are investing or making agreements to increase the usage of alternative energy sources to generate power.Why Investment in Wind Power is Profitable?While utilities are shifting focus toward renewables, solar and wind are gaining significant traction in the renewable industry. The adoption of wind energy has increased, courtesy of lower cost of turbines. In this regard, the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017 stated that wind turbine costs have declined by around half since 2010.This, in turn, has made the construction and maintenance of wind power projects cheaper, setting the stage for utility providers like WEC Energy to make valuable investments in wind projects like the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. Also, demand for wind energy isimpressive, with the Renewable Energy: United States report estimating a rise in of 7.2% in demand by 2021.Moreover, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) offered by the government have made investments in new wind project more productive. With these tax credits being extended through 2019, rising demand and declining turbine costs, we may expect to witness similar wind investments in the United States over the near term.This spectacular outlook for the U.S. wind energy space has prompted other utility providers to make notable investments in wind energy for expanding their clean energy portfolio. For instance, NextEra Energy, Inc’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary — NextEra Energy Resources — recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 MW of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, Texas.Similarly, to cater to the increasing demand for wind energy, NRG Energy Inc (NRG  -  Free Report) and Cypress Creek Renewables are set to develop a 25 MW solar project in Texas.Price MovementThe shares of WEC Energy have gained 5.0%, against the industry’s decline of 2.2% in last 12 months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksWEC Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

169,NEE,"JinkoSolar Holding Company Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has supplied 275.4 Megawatt-dc (MWdc) high-efficiency solar modules to Green Light Contractors Pty Ltd. These modules will be installed in Australia’s Bungala solar project.Details of the ProjectThe Bungala solar photovoltaic (PV) plant, with a generation capacity of more than 200 MW, is one of the largest solar farms in Australia. The plant aims to generate 23.5% energy from renewable sources by 2020.The Bungala project has two phases, with total estimated cost of $315 million. While its first 137.7 MWdc phase has started production, the rest of the operations are projected to commence by the third quarter of 2018.Australian Government’s Initiatives for Clean EnergyRealizing the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the government of Australia has been undertaking various initiatives to expand renewable generation portfolio. The country’s Clean Energy Regulator, post the seventh Emissions Reduction Fund auction, allocated more than $2.29 billion fund toward renewable energy.Solar is the least expensive option for alternative power generation, courtesy of lower cost of installation compared with most fossil fuel-powered generators. This along with improved technology, large number of panel installations and government initiatives will boost the solar market in Australia. We believe that the latest deal will enable JinkoSolar to reap benefits from the expanding Australian solar market. Further, the company expects to receive more such orders from Australia.Prospects in Global Solar MarketThe global renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth in the last several years. Realizing the need for a cleaner environment, consumers have rapidly adopted alternative energy sources. A key area of the renewable space is solar energy. With demand for solar energy rising, leading players are also expanding their contracts worldwide.JinkoSolar is following this similar trend. Recently, the company announced that its U.S.-based subsidiary has entered into a three-year agreement with sPower — an affiliate of AES Corp (AES  -  Free Report) — to supply 13 gigawatt (GW) high-efficiency solar modules. In March, JinkoSolar signed an agreement to supply 2.75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report). These contracts indicate the growing popularity of JinkoSolar’s modules in the global solar market.Price MovementJinkoSolar’s shares have lost 32.1% in a year against the industry’s rally of 21.3%. The downside might have been caused by stiff competition in the solar market. Zacks Rank & Key Pick    JinkoSolar currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is SolarEdge Technologies, Inc (SEDG  -  Free Report).

170,NEE,"American Electric Power Co., Inc.’s (AEP  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Southwestern Electric Power Co. (SWEPCO), recently announced that it has received the regulatory sanction from Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) to proceed with the Wind Catcher project. Notably the project involves a significant investment worth $4.5 billion.On completion, this project is likely to further expand the company’s renewable generation portfolio that comprised contracted projects worth 400 megawatts (MW) as of Mar 31, 2018. However, it remains subject to the approval of state commissions in Texas and Oklahoma.Details of the DealThe Wind Catcher project involves the acquisition of a 2,000 MW wind generation facility by American Electric. Currently, it is under constructionat Oklahoma Panhandle.The project also covers construction of an approximately 350-mile dedicated power line that will carry the wind energy to the Tulsa area, which will then be delivered through the company’s existing grid.  While, SWEPCO will own 70% of the project, another subsidiary of American Electric — Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) — will own 30% of the same. SWEPCO and PSO will purchase the facility once construction is over, in the fourth quarter of 2020.Benefits of the ProjectPer SWEPCO, the project will save its customers more than $4 billion over the 25-year life of the wind farm compared with the projected costs of buying power in the open market.Therefore, customers of American Electric should realize savings in their bills, primarily through a reduction in the fuel portion of bills, beginning in 2021.The 800 wind turbines to be installed in the farm will supplied by GE Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, GE Renewable Energy and manufactured in Louisiana. Thus, the construction of the Wind Catcher project will increase the manufacturing activity in Louisiana, thereby boosting the state’s economic growth.Why Wind Energy?A report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) shows that wind power generation will surpass hydroelectricity in the United States, in 2018. To this end, the EIA expects wind capacity to increase by 8.3 GW in 2018 and 8 GW in 2019.According to the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017,the cost of wind turbines is the single largest component that makes up for 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project. Markedly, wind turbine prices have fallen by around half since 2010.This, in turn, has made the construction of wind power projects cheaper, thereby setting the stage for utility providers like American Electric to make valuable investments in wind projects like the Wind Catcher farm.Moreover, being the largest single-site wind project in the United States, Wind Catcher will surely offer American Electric a competitive advantage over other utility providers that are also trying to reap benefits of the expanding wind energy market.Other Utilities Following SuitAccording to the Renewable Energy: United States report, demand for wind energy is likely to rise 7.2% by 2021. This has prompted other utility providers to make notable investments in wind energy for expanding their clean energy portfolio. For instance, NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 MW of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, Texas.With the Global Wind Energy Outlook expecting wind power to supply up to 12% of global electricity by 2020 (as per the Global Wind Energy Council) and the United States being one of the largest global wind markets, we may expect to witness more such wind project developments in the nation.Zacks Rank & Price MovementAmerican Electric currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In a year’s time, shares of American Electric have lost 8.5% compared with its industry’s decline of 6.2%.The underperformance may have been caused due to expenditures incurred by the company for meeting proposed environmental regulations.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

171,NEE,"Looking for broad exposure to the Utilities - Broad segment of the U.S. equity market? You should consider the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF (FUTY  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 10/21/2013.An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.Sector ETFs are also funds of convenience, offering many ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Utilities - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 15, placing it in bottom 6%.Index DetailsThe fund is sponsored by Fidelity. It has amassed assets over $300.76 M, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Utilities - Broad segment of the U.S. equity market. FUTY seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA IMI Utilities Index before fees and expenses.MSCI USA IMI Utilities Index represents the performance of the utilities sector in the U.S. equity market.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it the least expensive product in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.31%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk.

172,NEE,"NextEra Energy, Inc’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 megawatts (MW) of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, TX.Notably, in February 2018, the partnership struck a similar PPA worth 520 MW from two wind farms located in Texas and Oklahoma. Cumulatively, these two consecutive PPAs will deliver 820 MW of wind power, which will supply electricity to more than 372,000 homes per year.Economic Benefits of the PPAsPer management, these wind projects will bolster the overall economic growth of the states by boosting the employment rate. In particular, these projects will boost construction jobs by 1,000.Along with creating job opportunities, these projects are estimated to generate property tax revenues worth $190 million for local communities and lease payments of more than $167 million to landowners.Transition in Utility Space to RenewablesThe utility sector is currently undergoing a notable transition as the primary fuel source — coal — is gradually being replaced by natural gas and clean energy. Considering the need for a cleaner environment, consumers have rapidly increased the adoption of alternative energy sources nay renewables, over the last decade.Consequently, the outlook for the renewable energy industry is favorable. Evidently renewable energy sources are set to represent almost three quarters of the $10.2 trillion investment made worldwide  in new power-generating technology by 2040 (according to Bloomberg New Energy Outlook). To benefit from this rapidly expanding industry, utilities are increasingly shifting to renewables. NextEra Energy, being no exception, is following a similar trend.The company’s current renewal energy development program aims to bring 10,100-16,500 MW of new renewable projects (including wind repowering) online in the 2017-2020 period. Other electric utilities like NRG Energy Inc (NRG  -  Free Report) and Dominion Energy Inc (D  -  Free Report) are also focusing on cleaner sources to produce electricity.Why Wind?An EIA report shows that wind power generation will surpass hydroelectricity in 2018. Although changes in weather patterns affect wind generation, the forecast for wind power output is more dependent on the capacity and timing of new wind turbines coming online. In this line, EIA expects wind capacity to increase  by 8.3 GW in 2018 and 8 GW in 2019.According to the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017, demand for wind energy is likely to rise 7.2% by 2021. Meanwhile, the cost of wind turbines is the single largest component which makes up for 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project.Notably, wind turbine prices have fallen by around half since 2010. This has made the construction of wind power projects cheaper, thereby setting the stage for utility providers like NextEra Energy to make valuable investments in wind projects like the last one.   Zacks Rank & Price MovementNextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NextEra Energy’s shares have returned 12.9% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 8.1%.

173,NEE,"Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is among the few stocks that are displaying mixed sentiments. While we remain concerned of the company’s cost-overrun issues and elevated leverage, its commitment toward healthy dividend payouts, along with the recent divestment initiatives provide a ray of hope.Notably, the shares of this utility stock have declined around 14% in a year vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively lost 9.4%.Let’s delve deeper to find out the pros and cons of the stock.Major DeterrentsHigh Debt Raises Red Flag: Per the company’s last reported numbers, long-term debt came in at $44.4 billion, representing a debt-to-capital ratio of more than 63%. Apart from a rise in immediate finance costs, the high debt level will also require significant cash flow for repayments.Ballooning Cost of Construction Projects: Southern Company is bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns in two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — that have weighed on Southern Company's fortunes.Though Southern Company won Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of the Vogtle plant, the project is bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees. This is likely to hurt the utility's already weak financials. On the other hand, the Kemper Project has also been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution, escalating costs and multiple delays. The price tag of the project that had been estimated at $3 billion in 2010 has exceeded $7.5 billion. Moreover, with the suspension of all coal gasification operations, the Kemper project will now run as natural gas facility.Can Divestment Strides Keep Hurdles at Bay?Last month, Southern Company inked a $6.5 billion deal to divest stakes in several of its Florida assets to U.S.-based wholesale electricity supplier, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report). It also signed another agreement to jettison one third stake in its solar portfolio to Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd., a retirement, life and reinsurance company.Grappling with financial challenges, Southern Company is currently heading toward the retrenchment road. The deal seems to be a prudent decision. Apart from bolstering financials to some extent, the deal will help in streamlining its portfolio. The deal will also help raise cash to repay debts and pay for the new reactors of the Vogtle Project. With limited cash flow and large amounts of investment to make, the deal would surely provide some relief to the company.Investments in Natural Gas Also a PositiveWhile Southern Company is mainly focused on power generation and electricity distribution, serving the attractive Southeast market with a wide customer base, its foray into natural gas also bodes well.The buyout of energy services holding company, AGL Resources Inc., in 2016 has helped Southern Company significantly increase its customer base, while diversifying business by adding gas-distribution assets. Focusing on natural gas is likely to help the utility gain significant operational and commercial synergies in the long run. The company aims to invest around $6 billion in its state-regulated gas portfolio through 2022.That’s Not AllWith their regulated business models and stability in earnings, utilities are among the most consistent dividend stocks in the market. Southern Company’s attractive dividend yield of 5.4% is much higher than the industry's average of 3.7% and also ahead of notable peers like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report). In April, the company announced a 3.4% hike in its quarterly dividend. Notably, the hike marked the 282nd consecutive quarter of uninterrupted dividend payment by the utility.To ConcludeSouthern Company’s failed attempt to open the way for clean coal project along with construction of expensive nuclear reactors amid high debts dampen investors’ confidence, as is evident from its share performance. However, we believe that the company’s overall business is still strong and is likely to get buoyed up by its recent investments in natural gas. Thus, we think that its strategic strides, steady business model and attractive dividend payouts still hold promise for long-term growth.Southern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term EPS growth rate of 4.50%.

176,NEE,"OGE Energy Corp’s. (OGE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company (OG&E), recently signed an agreement with Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) and other regulatory parties to review rates for its Oklahoma customers. If approved, the new rates will take effect from Jul 1, 2018.Alongside the agreement, the company also reaffirmed its 2018 earnings guidance. It continues to expect the net income in the range of $380-$410 million or $1.90-$2.05 per share.Benefits of the AgreementThe agreement aims at the recovery of $400 million investment that OGE Energy made in its Mustang Energy Center.Under the terms of the agreement, the utility provider will cut down its rates by approximately $64 million. This in turn will reduce an average Oklahoma resident’s electricity bill by $4.44 per month.Rationale Behind the Rate ReformRate reduction is nothing new in the Utility space. In the United States, government regulations dominate the Utility sector. Therefore, the utility providers frequently file for rate changes with the states’ utility commission, to keep their revenue requirement competitive in tandem with changing market conditions.We believe that, this time, the latest tax reform has triggered this rate reduction. Of late, we have witnessed the latest tax reduction resulting in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and various companies passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills. In this regard, OGE Energy is no exception as is evident from the latest rate review settlement for its Oklahoma customers. This rate review is preceded by the fuel cost reduction that the company implemented in March 2018. Such rate reviews tend to attract customers for the utility providers.In recent times, we have witnessed some other utilities, directing the federal tax savings to reduce electricity bills for the customers. Notably, utility providers, including the likes of Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and AVANGRID (AGR  -  Free Report), have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers.Looking AheadOGE Energy plans on filing a rate review to the Oklahoma Commission, later this year, for two of its environmental projects, based in Oklahoma. These projects include the installation of dry scrubbers at its Sooner Power Plant and the conversion of two of the three coal-fired units to natural gas units at its Muskogee plant. Both these plants are on course to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional Haze Rule requirements.Management expects Mustang Energy Center to aid the company in further reducing OG&E's carbon footprint, enhancing grid reliability and offering an improved ability to support renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar. If approved by OCC, the latest settlement agreement will facilitate reducing the expanding costs in connection to the aforementioned environmental projects.Price MovementOGE Energy’s stock has gained 8% in the last one year compared to the industry’s decline of 2.9%. The outperformance may have been led by its systematic investment in base distribution and generation projects.Zacks Rank    OGE Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

181,NEE,"JinkoSolar Holding Company Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its U.S.-based subsidiary has entered into a three-year agreement with sPower, an affiliate of AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report). Per the terms, the subsidiary will supply 13 gigawatt (GW) of high-efficiency solar modules to sPower.Solar Prospects in the U.S.A key area of the renewable space in the United States is solar energy. Per an Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, solar electricity generation in 2017 was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d), which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018 and 294 GWh/d in 2019. In spite of the rapid uptake, solar contributed just 1.3% of the total U.S. utility-scale generation in 2017, indicating immense scope for growth in the days ahead.Interestingly, a sharp drop in the cost of solar energy hints at higher demand for alternative energy. Per a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) modules prices had dropped more than 80% in 2017 from 2009. This has further set the stage for solar power providers like sPower to expand their business by purchasing increased modules from suppliers like JinkoSolar, as is evident from the latest deal.Our ViewIn January 2018, President Trump implemented 30% tariff on import of solar panel components. The tariff slam subsequently led the non-U.S.-based solar companies to put up solar manufacturing facilities in the United States.In line with this, the company announced in March its intention to open its first U.S. factory in Florida. Such a strategic move will not only enable the company to avoid the import tariff on a whole but also provide increased flexibility to support its local partners in the days to come.Coming to JinkoSolar’s achievements in the United States, JinkoSolar has been able to acquire major solar module supply agreements in the country, of late. Evidently, in January 2018, the company sealed a deal to supply 1.75 GW of its high-efficiency solar modules, over approximately three years, to a U.S. counterparty.In March, JinkoSolar agreed to supply 2.75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report). Such deals reflect the huge demand for JinkoSolar’s modules in the United States and offer scope for more such contract wins.  The company already enjoys a solid relationship with sPower and till date has successfully supplied over 800 megawatt (MW) of solar modules for the latter’s PV projects. The latest agreement should further strengthen JinkoSolar's strategic relationship with sPower, which includes significant down payments, thereby helping the company expand manufacturing capacity in the United States.Price MovementJinkoSolar’s stock has lost 33.3% in a year compared with the industry’s gain of 37.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by stiff competition in the solar market.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    JinkoSolar currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

182,NEE,"NextEra Energy’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) received an approval from The Florida Public Service Commission to buy the City of Vero Beach's electric utility system. This transaction is expected to be completed within Oct 1 and increase the existing customer base of FPL by 35,000.This purchase will be immediately beneficial for the existing City of Vero Beach utility customers. FPL’s typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill is still 20% lower than the City of Vero Beach customers. So, the electric utility customers of the City of Vero Beach will find their utility bills dropping post Oct 1, when they will become FPL customers.Increasing Usage of Clean SourcesNextEra Energy has plans to invest more than $40 billion in new infrastructure investments through 2020, which will not only help to produce more clean energy but also increase the reliability of its services.In addition to producing higher volume of electricity from renewable sources, NextEra Energy has more than 100 megawatt (MW) of batteries with energy storage systems in operation, making it available to users when they need. Batteries help to store electricity when energy demand is low and supply when energy demand is high.The battery storage devices will support the grid and further enhance the importance of renewable sources production in the total generation mix.Planned InvestmentNextEra Energy's investments will be directed to modernize and strengthen the existing infrastructure of the company, enabling it to serve its expanding customer base more effectively.Out of the total planned capital expenditure, FPL projects total capital deployment of $17.5-$19.0 billion from the 2017-2020 time period in various projects. The new investments in natural gas fueled the projects to lower its carbon footprint.NextEra Energy’s 1,750 MW Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, a power-generating facility fueled by natural gas is on schedule and within budget. The project, expected to begin operation from mid-2019, will help the company meet the increasing demand for power in Florida. In addition, the new 1,200-MW FPL Dania Beach Clean Energy Center will be fueled by clean-burning natural gas. The facility is expected to begin operation by mid-2022.These clean generation units will help the company to serve its expanding customer base more efficiently. FPL serves nearly 5 million customers in the sunshine state. It served 53,000 more customers in first-quarter 2018 than the year-ago level.Consolidation in the Utility SpaceDominion Energy (D  -  Free Report) and SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) are in a merger deal, which is expected to be completed by 2018 end, subject to approval by the regulatory commission. Per the agreement, each stockholder of SCANA is likely to get 0.669 shares of Dominion Energy. Considering the assumption of SCANA’s huge debt load, — $6.9 billion as of Dec 31, 2017 — the transaction is roughly worth $14.6 billion.

183,NEE,"PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) announced that it has acquired Safari Energy LLC, a leading provider of solar energy solutions. Safari Energy provides a turnkey solution to its customers, starting from financing their projects to designing, engineering and construction.The company management did not divulge details about the purchase consideration but expects this acquisition to be accretive to its earnings immediately. However, the acquisition is not expected to make a meaningful contribution to the company’s earnings per share till 2020.Acquisition Synergy & Future PlanWith the buyout of Safari Energy, the company would be able to avail of low-risk opportunity in renewable & clean energy segment. The acquisition would enable it to diversify its revenue components and the customer base. The transaction would help PPL Corporation gain expertise in turnkey projects for serving clients, who need support right from the project’s seed funding till its construction and completion.The company planned to replace its Kentucky’s coal fired generation plant over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas. It expects to incur approximately $15.41 billion of capital investment over the 2018-2022 period and projects to recover nearly 80% of the annual investment within a year, thereby lending a clear visibility to its earnings growth.Solar Industry OutlookPer U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the source of energy from renewables increased over the years. Of 55% of the total energy generated, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States during 2017, was from a renewable source. Also, 22% of the total electricity generation in the United States comes from a renewable source as of Feb 2018.In 2017, electricity generation from solar resources touched nearly 77 million megawatthours (MWH) in the United States and by 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the consistent growth over the years across some of the renewable energy sources is attributable to U.S. federal policies. Electricity generation from solar enjoys a special Federal Solar Tax Credit, scheduled to expire by 2022. This tax credit has enabled the growth of solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generators is transferred to end users via lower solar prices.Price MovementSince the release of the news, shares of PPL Corporation have lost 1.3% compared with its industry’s decline of 1.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are as follows:CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

184,NEE,"Duke Energy Corp.’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Piedmont Natural Gas, recently announced that it has received the regulatory nod for altering its natural gas rates from the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). As a result, the average residential customer of Duke Energy in North Carolina will witness a $1 decline in their monthly bill. The changes will be effective from Jun 1, 2018.Details of the Rate ChangeIn May 2018, Piedmont Natural Gas proposed to change two separate components of its natural gas billing rate — the Integrity Management Rider (IMR) and the benchmark commodity cost. The proposal was submitted to the NCUC. Notably, the IMR rate change proposal offered a decrease of $0.44 per dekatherm for residential customers and $0.26 per dekatherm for small and medium general-service customers. On the flip side, an increase from $2.50 per dekatherm to $2.75 per dekatherm was proposed for the benchmark commodity cost of natural gas.Cumulatively, these rate changes will reduce a North Carolinian residential customer’s billing rate by $0.19 per dekatherm. In fact, this new rate change marked the fourth decrease in natural gas rates for the company’s North Carolina customers in 2018.Per management, including the latest rate reform, the company’s average residential customer's monthly bill has decreased by approximately $6.Rationale Behind the Rate ReformRate reduction is nothing new in the Utility space. In the United States, government regulations dominate the Utility sector. Therefore, the utility providers frequently file for rate changes with the states’ utility commission to keep their revenue requirement competitive, in tandem with changing market conditions.We believe, this time the latest tax reform has triggered this rate reduction. Of late, we have witnessed that the latest tax reduction resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and various companies are passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills. In this regard, Duke Energy is no exception. The company has also followed the same path and have reduced its electricity as well as natural gas rates, which in turn, has allowed it to reward the customers with tax savings.In fact, this latest rate reduction is in line with the company’s earlier-made recommendation. On fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Duke Energy stated that the lower tax rates should be applied to reduce utility rates for the customers in the near term and aid in offsetting rate increases in the future.In recent times, we have witnessed some other utilities directing the federal tax savings to reduce bills for the customers. Notably, utility providers including the likes of NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), AVANGRID (AGR  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings , have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Duke Energy has lost 10.1% compared with the broader industry’s decline of 5.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.Zacks Rank Duke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Post divestiture of additional assets, the company will look forward to utilize another $500 million to buyback shares.However, a number of NRG Energy's “merchant” facilities function without long-term power sales agreements and are influenced by market price fluctuations.

190,NEE,"Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to divest stakes in several of its Florida assets to the U.S.-based wholesale electricity supplier, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), in a bid to strengthen its financials. Atlanta-based electric utility, Southern Company will sell its Gulf Power Company, Florida City Gas, along with interests in the Oleander and Stanton natural gas plants in a deal valued $6.5 billion.  Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Southern Company have moved up 1.66% to close at $43.44 on May 21. Meanwhile, shares of NextEra have edged up 2.41% to eventually close at $160.22. The deal seems to be a win-win for both the companies. While the move will help NextEra to expand and diversify its operations, it will address Southern Company’s leverage issues at the same time.Deal DetailsThe total transaction value is estimated at around $6.5 billion. This includes $5.1 billion in cash, which is expected to be financed by the issuance of new debt. Moreover, NextEra will also assume the $1.4 billion debt burden of Gulf Power, raising the total consideration to $6.5 billion.NextEra will be acquiring the Florida-based utility, Gulf Power, which serves around 450,000 customers in eight counties in Northwest Florida. Further, it will also purchase Florida City Gas, which supplies natural gas to approximately 111,000 residential and commercial consumers in four counties along the state’s East Coast.Apart from these holdings, NextEra will buy Southern Company’s entire stake in Oleander Plant — a 791-MW gas-fired simple-cycle combustion turbine power plant — which the latter purchased from Constellation Energy Group in 2005. The cash-starved Southern Company will also jettison its 65% stake in the Stanton Energy Centre — a gas-fired combined cycle plant — to NextEra. Both Oleander and Stanton Plants have dual fuel power, with distillate as the backup fuel.Subject to approvals from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Federal Trade Commission, the acquisition of Gulf Power and Stanton/Oleander facilities is set for closure in the first half of 2019. On the other hand, subject to Federal Trade Commission’s approval, the Florida City Gas buyout is likely to close by the third quarter of 2018.Deal Rationale for Southern CompanyThe deal is likely to be a prudent strategy for Southern Company, which is grappling with elevated leverage along with cost overruns in two of its large construction projects, Vogtle and Kemper. Notably, the company, which spent around $12 billion for the AGL Resources buyout in 2016 to expand and diversify its offerings, is heading toward the retrenchment road, weighed by its financial struggles. As of Mar 31, the company’s long-term debt stood at $44.4 billion, representing a debt-to-capital ratio of more than 63%.The company suffered a massive loss last year when Mississippi Public Service Commission ordered Southern Company’s subsidiary, Mississippi Power Company, to suspend all coal gasification operations in the Kemper project, thus converting it to a natural gas project. Originally estimated at around $3 billion, the project’s cost ballooned to $7.3 billion, affecting its commercial viability and balance sheet. The Vogtle project is also being bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees. The project’s cost is soaring to $25 million, thereby increasing its credit risk. With Southern Company winning Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of the Vogtle plant in December 2017, the divestiture deal will enable the company to sharpen its focus on the first U.S. nuclear project in decades.With the divestiture deal, Southern Company will also be able to streamline its portfolio, boost utility returns, along with raise cash to repay debts and pay for the new reactors. The sale eliminates the overhang of its equity needs by helping the company reduce $3 billion from the amount it is required to raise in the next three years. In fact, the company is planning to offload its interests in its solar projects as well as raise another $1 billion. It is also seeking $1 billion in third-party tax equity financing for its wind projects.Thus, apart from bolstering its financial strength, the deal will streamline Southern Company’s portfolio and enable the company to forge ahead with its Vogtle Project more effectively. With limited cash flow and large amounts of investment to make, the deal would provide some relief to the company.Deal Benefits to NextEraThe deal has enabled Next Era, America’s most valuable power company, to significantly progress with its strategic expansion. The deal will further enhance its long-term growth prospects in a space, in which it already has a command.The acquired assets, including the regulated electric and natural gas franchises, serve as a complementary fit to NextEra’s existing portfolio in Florida. The assets, which are a perfect geographic and strategic fit, will lead to several commercial, financial and operational synergies.Upon closure, the deal is likely to be immediately accretive to NextEra’s earnings. As a result, the company raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2020 and 2021 by 15 cents and 20 cents, respectively.The company, which has a long-term track record of delivering value to its shareholders, is likely to continue its momentum, going forward. NextEra expects to maintain $5-$7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity, post the completion of the deal and is likely to witness an upgrade in its credit ratings.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Southern Company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Southern Company (The) Price  Southern Company (The) Price | Southern Company (The) QuoteSome better-ranked players in the same industry include NRG Energy, Inc.

207,NEE,"Utility is one of the most stable sectors as it is not affected by market volatility. Utility companies are generally regulated and focus on domestic services. Investing in fundamentally strong, mature electric utility companies is safe as it provides stable earnings and cash flow rewards to investors through regular dividends. Currently, dividend yield of 3.34% from Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry is better than the S&P 500 index’s 1.75%.As of now, 89% of S&P 500 companies have already reported their first-quarter 2018 results. Utility Sector registered 19.9% earnings growth and 8.8% revenue growth in the first quarter. The upside can be attributed to favorable weather conditions, tax reforms and higher return from regulated operations and infrastructure investments.In this article, we run a comparative analysis on two prominent electric power utilities — Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc (NEE  -  Free Report) — to figure which one performed better and is a suitable investment option right now.Earnings & Surprise TrendDominion Energy reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of $1.14 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 by 10.7%.

Moreover, it is planning to reward shareholders with a 10% dividend hike in 2018 & 2019. To achieve an increase from 6% to 10% by 2020, the company has undertaken aggressive initiatives, which will help Dominion to cope with dismal MLP financial markets.NextEra Energy’s adjusted earnings guidance for 2018 is pegged in the range of $7.45-$7.95.The company has commenced construction on the Mountain Valley Pipeline and anticipates it to come online from December 2018. Moreover, Florida Public Service Commission approved Dania Beach Clean Energy Center project. NextEra Energy is on track to achieve its goals.Estimates MovementIn the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dominion Energy’s earnings in 2018 and 2019 moved up 1% and 0.7% respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 2018 and 2019 moved up 0.3% and 0.12%, respectively, for NextEra Energy.Dominion Energy has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four trailing quarters.Zacks RankDominion Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

209,NEE,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) has received necessary approval from The Illinois Commerce Commission (“ICC”) to pass on the tax savings resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).The new act became effective Jan 1, 2018 and has lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This led to reduction in the amount of federal income tax ComEd will pay to the government. ComEd sought approval from ICC to pass its tax savings of nearly $200 million to its residential customers in Illinois which will result in average savings of $2-$3 per month from February. Without ICC’s approval customers would not realize savings from the tax cut until 2020.Tax Cuts – A Boon for UtilitiesUtilities in some states are trying to use the tax cut to lower the bill of their customers.  Utilities are passing on the benefits to their customer base either through reduction in existing electric rates or by adjusting the planned rate increases.Passing on tax savings does not look significant when we consider a single user or a single utility, however, it is significant when we consider the nation as a whole. Already decisions have been taken to pass on more than billions of dollars in tax savings to customers and we expect this amount to increase.Utilities like AVANGRID, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) among others, have also expressed intention to pass on the tax savings benefits to customers. NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), on the other hand, has decided to use the tax savings of nearly $1.3 billion to recoup the storm recovery expenses, without increasing the bills of its users in Florida.Quality Service at Low PricesThe savings due to tax cuts will allow the residential customers of ComEd to enjoy safe and reliable services at a very competitive price.Since 2001, ComEd has invested in excess of $5 billion to strengthen its electrical transmission and distributions system and has also nearly completed the installation of nearly 4 million smart meters. ComEd rates are low compared with the average electric rates in 10 largest American cities.Thanks to the tax cuts, the user will enjoy the benefits from strengthening infrastructure of its service provider, at lower rates.Price MovementExelon’s shares have returned 7.9% last year, outperforming the rally of 2.3% from the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank Exelon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

211,NEE,"Benchmarks closed in negative territory on Thursday following concerns over a likelihood of a government shutdown. Sectors like real estate and utilities, which are considered as alternatives to bonds, declined after yield on 10-year Treasury notes reached its highest level since 2014. Additionally, increase in U.S. gasoline inventories and sharp rise in domestic crude production weighed on oil prices, which in turn led the energy sector downward.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.4%, or 96.32 points to close at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,798.03. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,296.05, losing 2.23 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 2.6% to close at 12.22. A total of around 6.93 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Shutdown Specter Weighs on BenchmarksAfter closing at new all-time highs on Wednesday all the three key U.S. indexes fell on Thursday following concerns of partial government shutdown.  On Thursday, the House voted 230 to 197 in favor of passing a short-term spending bill, in order to avoid government shutdown. However, the bill is expected to face a setback in the Senate, which in turn raised concerns of a possible government shutdown. Following this development, nine of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors fell during the day.Higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.579% to 2.611% on Thursday, reaching its best level since September 2014. Higher treasury yields weighed on steady dividend paying sectors like real estate and utilities.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 1%, becoming the worst performing sector of the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Additionally, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) decreased 0.6%, with its two major components Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) falling 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively.Oil Slump Weighs on Energy, MS Earnings ComfortMoreover, for the week ended Jan 12 total motor gasoline inventories climbed 3.62 million barrels, per the Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) weekly petroleum data. Also, U.S. crude production increased 258,000 barrels per day to 9.75 million barrels, after falling in the preceding week. Increase in gasoline inventories and stronger domestic crude production led both WTI and Brent crude to decrease 0.03% and 0.1% to $63.95 per barrel and $69.31 a barrel, respectively.Fall in oil prices led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to decline 0.8%, which was second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key components, including Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) fell 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.

216,NEE,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24. Last quarter, this utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayManagement expects NextEra Energy’s performance in the first half of 2018 to be softer in comparison to second half results. The company expects its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company’s (FPL) performance to be lower than expected, as tax savings will not immediately offset its typical reserve amortization requirements. This is going to have an adverse impact on earnings in the first quarter.In January 2018, FPL announced its plans to apply federal tax savings toward the Hurricane Irma restoration cost of $1.3 billion. Otherwise, it would have increased utility bills of 4.9 million customers in the first quarter of 2018.However, the economy of Florida remains sturdy, with its current unemployment rate below the national average. Plus, new building permits indicate customer additions and an increase in demand from the residential space.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.NextEra Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  NextEra Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NextEra Energy, Inc. QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is pegged at -0.29%.Zacks Rank: NextEra Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though the Zacks Rank #3 increases the possibility of a beat, an ESP of -0.29% makes it unlikely this season.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderInstead, here are a few players from the industry that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Xcel Energy Inc.

217,NEE,"As solar energy keeps getting cheaper by the day, countries across the globe are fast adapting to the clean energy source to fulfil all energy needs. Countries like China have stepped up their game by investing significantly in cutting-edge technologies related to solar energy. As a matter of fact, China has also surpassed the United States when it comes to investing in clean energy. This has led to speculation about the future of solar energy in the United States and whether it would lose to China in the solar race.Short answer: No. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has announced significant investments committed solely to developing the solar technology in the country. Also, the private sector has seized this opportunity to invest openhandedly in solar projects. Finally, the space witnessed a massive revolution in the last decade even as the U.S. government continues to keep pushing boundaries in the solar space.U.S. DOE to Fund Development of Solar TechnologyOn Apr 17, 2018, the U.S. DOE announced that it had reserved as much as $105.5 million for funding approximately 70 projects to enhance solar photovoltaic (PV) as well as concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) technologies. The funding also seeks to start off the process to securely integrate these projects into America’s national electric supply framework.U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry’s announcement regarding the funding also aims at preparing the US labor force for the future of the solar industry in the country. The funding program has been divided into four segments: About $46 million would be earmarked for about 14 advanced solar systems integration technologies, about $24 million would be spent on 21 CSP R&D projects and approximately $27 million would be kept aside for 28 projects for PV R&D. Finally, $8.5 million would be used to enhance the solar industry by preparing the workforce for the future.Federal funding has done a world of good to the energy landscape of the United States in the last 10 years. The return on investments from such federal projects has been astonishing. Investments to advance energy efficient technology have led to savings of about $22 billion. That roughly translates to a benefit-to-cost ratio of 66:1. Further, DOE’s continued efforts to reduce emission levels are likely to generate benefits of nearly $111 billion by the end of 2020.Corporate Ventures in the PipelineDeclining costs associated to wind and solar power along with grid developments have resulted in many global companies showing interest in the space. Further, conforming to the norm, even U.S.-based solar corporations have planned new ventures for the coming days.In March 2018, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced the single largest corporate purchase of solar power in the United States by signing an agreement with sPower — a subsidiary of AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report) — to add 315 MW of electricity via two solar projects in Virginia.Further, again in March, NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) announced an agreement to purchase solar panel from Chinese solar module manufacturer — JinkoSolar Holding (JKS  -  Free Report). Over the next four years, JinkoSolar will supply approximately 2,750 MW of high-efficiency solar modules to NextEra Energy. Production of the solar panels will start in the second half of 2018. (Read More)San Jose, CA based SunPower Corp.’s (SPWR  -  Free Report) CEO Tom Werner stated last month that the company plans to set up a factory somewhere in the United States. Also, on Apr 18, the company entered into an agreement with Germany’s solar panel manufacturer SolarWorld for an undisclosed amount.The deal is expected to add a further 500MW to the company’s production capacity. The company has also entered into a deal with NextEra Energy to provide solar panels to the latter. SunPower has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Factors Supporting Sector’s GrowthWhat has kept the sector afloat has primarily been a steep reduction in cost of wind and solar energy. Per a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) modules prices had dropped more than 80% in 2017 from 2009. Costs related to electricity from solar PV fell by about three-quarters in the period between 2010 and 2017. Also, the global weighted average cost of electricity (LCOE) of utility-scale solar PV has seen a decline of 73% since 2010.Another reason why the segment has done well is the high demand outlook for renewables. Per, Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017, domestic demand for clean energy is expected to surge to 12.6 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) by the end of 2021.Demand for solar energy in particular, is expected to soar 20% annually on the back of its abundant supply. This makes solar energy a better alternative to fossil fuel, which is deemed to get exhausted.Finally, the solar space has also richly benefited from the environmental tax credit which was introduced as part of the $1.15 trillion federal spending bill of December 2015. Per the terms of the Bill, the Congress modified and extended federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators.This helped solar corporations to claim federal Investment Tax Credits (""ITC"") at 30% of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners, essentially allowing for more funds for R&D.To ConcludeWashington’s continuous drive to establish a sustainable solar industry within the United States has resulted in the government splurging even more on the clean energy space. Labs controlled by governments together with private corporations have led to ground-breaking developments in the alternative energy space. Despite China’s efforts to stay at the top of the solar race by investing much more than its competitors, America has fast caught up with the Asian giant.Further, cost-efficient technology in the United States has enabled the government to save billions of dollars as well as created plenty of jobs. It would therefore be incorrect to say that the United States lags China, which currently suffers from its credit woes and therefore severe paucity of funds. The right investments would certainly place the United States ahead of China in the solar race.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

218,NEE,"Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) will offer a notable $38 million in annual tax savings on electric and natural gas bills for its customers in Ohio and Kentucky, beginning from April and May 2018. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that came into effect on Jan 1, 2018, clearly led to this entire bill reduction.Details of Projected Tax SavingsIn particular, Duke Energy’s customers, residing in Ohio, would save approximately $20 million in annual tax on their electric bills. Beyond this tax saving proposition, the company’s Ohio-based unit has also proposed state regulators for lowering natural gas bills by about $3 million, commencing from May.Duke Energy also proposed tax savings for Kentucky-based customers as the state regulators reviewed its proposal, recommending an allocation of around $15 million of tax act benefits.Our ViewThe latest tax reform has resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and lately, various companies are passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills. Being no exception, Duke Energy has also followed the same path and must have reduced its electricity as well as natural gas rates, which in turn has allowed it to reward the customers with tax savings.Notably, this rate reduction is in line with the company’s earlier-made recommendation, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, of using the lower tax rates to reduce utility rates for the customers in the near-term as well as aid in offsetting future rate increases.We have witnessed some other utilities in the recent past, directing the federal tax savings to reduce bills for the customers. Notably, utilities, including the likes of NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), AVANGRID (AGR  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings , have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers.Moreover, the recent tax reform will enable Duke Energy to increase the utility rate base, which occurs due to low tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation, resulting in lower deferred taxes, which in turn increases rate base. As a result, the company is projected to witness a higher rate base growth along with an increase in the company's earnings growth.Price MovementDuke Energy has edged down 5.9% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s decline of 47.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

219,NEE,"Ormat Technologies, Inc. (ORA  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Viridity Energy Solutions, Inc. will start the construction of two 20 megawatt (MW)/20MWh utility scale, in-front-of-the-meter battery energy storage systems (“BESS”) located in Plumsted Township and Alpha, NJ.The BESS will assist in balancing energy demand in the electricity grid and is expected to generate revenues in the range of $7-$8 million in 2019. The revenues will be based on spot price, which generally varies from period to period.Details of the ProjectViridity Energy Solutions will utilize Dynapower Company’s inverters and LG Chem’s modules for the two 20MW/20MWh BESSs. In addition, Viridity’s VPower™ software will provide the visualization, optimization, economic value stacking and automated control of the BESS, which in turn will result in better performance of the electric grid.Importance of the Storage ProjectOur general conception is that electricity needs to be consumed as and when it is produced. However, development of the utility-scale battery storage projects has changed that concept as it helps in the storage of electricity. Batteries store electricity at times of oversupply when market prices are low and release it later when there is a shortage during high prices at peak hours or when there is a scarcity in supply from other sources of electricity generation.Plus, the increasing generation of electricity from renewable sources like solar, wind and water also increases the need and importance of battery storage projects. Renewable sources like sun rays are not available 24x7 to satisfy our demand for electricity, so these batteries help to store the energy to be used later when sun rays are not available.  Future of Energy Storage Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) release, more than 700 MW of battery storage units have already been installed in the United States.Large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and National Grid plc (NGG  -  Free Report) have started to invest in battery storage projects. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the United States, given the increasing production of electricity from renewable sources.The research report from IHS indicates the global energy storage market to expand at a very fast pace, with total installation surging from 6 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 to more than 40 GW by 2022.Price MovementIn a month’s time, shares of Ormat Technologies have outperformed its industry.

223,NEE,"Edison International’s (EIX  -  Free Report) unit Southern California Edison (“SCE”) has received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to begin four electric transportation pilot projects that will help increase usage of electric in transportation. The primary objective of these transportation pilots is to lower emission levels and meet California’s 2030 greenhouse gas and air pollution reduction goals.California aims to lower its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels. SCE, through its transportation pilot projects, will expand the usage of electricity in cars, buses, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial vehicles and equipment.Emission Reduction BenefitsSouthern California is the gateway for nearly 40% of the goods entering the United States, which move through the region’s ports and  highways. It is evident that the goods movement through the heavy vehicles is major source of emission in this region.The pilot projects primarily aim to promote development of more electric charging points that will assist in charging the electric vehicles and work on electrification of the equipment used in ports. The projects are part of the $550 million investment program, which the commission is yet to approve.Reduction of pollution from the transportation space, which is the major contributor to emission levels in California will help to achieve the pollution reduction goals. Also, several utility scale renewable energy projects are coming up in the state, which will help in achieving the target.Road Ahead SCE serves nearly 15 million people in its 50,000 square miles of service area. To efficiently serve the growing population of California, the company aims to invest $14.7 billion in next few years to strengthen and expand its existing electricity infrastructure.Also, energy efficiency programs of SCE have helped customers save enough energy to power 1.2 million homes for a year.SCE’s massive asset base and expertise will allow it to develop the transportation electrification market in California and these pilot projects are means to achieve the same.Price MovementEdison International’s shares have lost 13.6% in a year against the industry’s gain of 2.8%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdison International currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

224,NEE,"The third-quarter earnings season is fast approaching its peak. As of Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. By end of Oct 27, nearly 267 members of the index are expected to release their numbers.Total earnings for these 87 S&P 500 members are up 9.4% year over year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating earnings per share estimates and 70.1% surpassing revenue estimates.Amid this positive performance so far let us focus on the Zacks Utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 4% this season. Notably, at present, nine out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve raised the rates twice in this year — in March and June. This will definitely hurt the sector’s stocks. In addition, the hurricanes also adversely impacted the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for investors.Let us take a sneak peek at few utility stocks that are scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Oct 26.NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy’s revenues is pegged at $4,893 million, indicating 4.01% year over year and 12.4% sequential increase. We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its FPL segment.However, Hurricane Irma is likely to adversely impact the company’s earnings. NextEra Energy’s earnings are projected to be $1.75 per share, reflecting a sequential drop by a penny.NextEra Energy’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.75. According to our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 have higher chances of beating estimates.

(AEP  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 8.54% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.American Electric Power is expected to benefit from the improving economic conditions in its service territories and its efficient cost-management initiatives.Ohio and Texas operations contributes a major share of company's utility revenues. Power generation from these states is deregulated, consequently leading to the current lower price environment. This, in turn, is expected to hurt earnings of American Electric Power.Hurricane Harvey that hit the coasts of Texas last month, hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines leading to widespread outages in the state. American Electric Power’s subsidiary, AEP Texas, is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers. Therefore, we expect the company’s third-quarter bottom line to be affected due to outages.American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  American Electric Power Company, Inc.

We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its Electric segment. Economic growth in its service territories, especially in Minnesota and systematic investment in regulated operation is expected to boost the bottom line. The company’s focus to produce more electricity from renewable sources will also yield positive results.Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Xcel Energy Inc.

225,NEE,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Penn Power recently announced that it is currently concluding work on power line and substation projects worth $15 million to reduce the number and duration of power outages in the company's service area.The projects are part of Penn Power's 2016-2020 Long-Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP) approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. Notably, the company expects to invest $62 million through 2020 under this project, with an aim to improve infrastructure and distribution lines across the service area.Details of the LTIIP ProjectsNotably, LTIIP projects will involve building new substations as well as distribution lines near Jackson Center and New Castle, with investments worth $3.1 million and $2.6 million respectively. Another line will be constructed between Pymatuning Central and Jamestown for an investment worth $1.2 million. Once the substations are connected, these are anticipated to ensure redundancy across Penn Power’s service area along with providing additional options for routing power on the local system. It will also reduce the frequency and length of power outages.Additionally, an investment of $0.6 million is anticipated toward replacement of an underground conductor in Sewickley, to improve system reliability. Remote-controlled switches worth $0.5 million will be installed to enable faster power restoration.Our ViewPenn Power currently serves approximately 160,000 customers across its service area. As witnessed previously, FirstEnergy has been active in pursuing its “Energizing the Future” plan through subsidiaries. This plan was initiated to primarily upgrade and expand the company’s regulated transmission capabilities across its area of operations. Under the initiative, the company has mapped out plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2 to $5.8 billion over the 2017–2021 time period.Recently, the company’s Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) unit announced the completion of project equipment upgradation worth $3 million at a substation in Reading, PA.

226,NEE,"WGL Holdings, Inc.’s , subsidiary Washington Gas, has announced plans to file recommendations with state regulatory commissions, in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia for reducing natural gas rates for 1.1 million customers it serves in this region.The rate filing aim to reduce customer rates, which is expected to lower annual customer bills by approximately $34 million, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. This development will certainly be a relief for customers as the company earlier expected up to 18% increase in heating bills compared with last winter due to the mild weather last year.What Led to the Decision?The unit’s decision to file for rate decline is a result of the federal tax savings that the company expects to attain in future.WGL Holdingsanticipates realizing the federal tax savings on the back of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a law that was passed on Dec 22, 2017. The law came into effect on Jan 1, 2018. Going ahead, Washington Gas will bear only 21% of corporate income tax, which is significantly lower than its previous tax rate of 35%.A 14% cut in federal income tax means that the company will naturally be able to save up considerable amount in tax savings. This 169-year old utility company has been working relentlessly to provide quality services to customer at best possible prices. Sharing tax reduction benefit will allow its customers to enjoy reliable services at a reduced price.How is WGL Gaining?The company’s decision to propose a rate slash in customer bill is a clear indication of its commitment in retaining the large customer base. We have witnessed reliable results on the back of customer additions in the past, which can be evidenced from 16,689 customer additions during fiscal 2017, compared with year-ago period. In fact, high customer additions along with investment initiatives, must have aided the company to deliver positive surprise of 8.5% during in fiscal 2017.For the past six years, the company has invested $100 million annually on an average in the form of investments in the energy systems. The company is currently equipped with 235 generation projects in the US, representing approximately 145 megawatts (MW) in service, with additional 66 MW under construction. These factors will aid the company in delivering growth targets and position it in meeting the increasing needs of its expanding customer base.Price MovementShares of WGL Holdings have outperformed the industry in the last three months.

234,NEE,"President Donald Trump finally set in motion tariffs on as much as up to $60 billion in Chinese imports on Thursday. Consequently, China too has announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the United States, giving rise to fears of an ensuing trade war. This saw the Dow once again tumbling more than 700 points or almost 3% on Thursday.Going by the 90-year S&P 500 history, March is considered a one of the best months for stocks. This too seems to have been proven wrong this time, as the markets failed to start the month on a high owing to Trump’s proposed imposition of 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, respectively.Evidence of the panic is the spiking of the market’s preferred fear guage to its highest level since Feb 5. Given that these events could drastically dent investor confidence, picking low beta stocks looks like a smart option at this point. Beta measures the tendency of a stock's returns to respond to market swings. Low correlation stocks provide protection during turbulent times as these are less prone to day-to-day fluctuations.Volatility Index SpikesAfter trade fears escalated, the CBOE Volatility Index, which gauges the level of fear gripping the market, skyrocketed 31% to hit 23.35, finally settling at 24.04 on Thursday. The VIX has more than doubled so far this year. Current weakness in the technology sector as well as the selloff which ensued post Trump’s levies on China, pushed up VIX. This also marked the highest increase for VIX in a single session since Feb 5, when the fear-gauge doubled from its lowest-ever level.U.S.-China Trade War to Follow?Trade war fears showed up in late February and the markets have remained volatile in March. Early this month, Trump finally announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which saw shares of major automakers and airline companies declining. Although Canada was Mexico, the largest exporters of steel to the United States, were exempted, the move was tailored at targeting China.Trump has been quite vocal about his ‘America First’ agenda, a culmination of his longstanding view that weak U.S. trade policies have affected the country’s workforce and increased the federal deficit. No sooner did the metal tariffs come into effect, Trump announced his plans of imposing tariffs of as much as $60 billion on Chinese imports, which were given the final shape on Thursday.The initial fears, which already saw shares declining throughout March, finally saw the Dow Jones industrial average taking a massive hit, closing down more than 724 points or 2.9% on Thursday. This also marks the blue-chip average’s fifth worst daily point drop in history. Also, this is the worst drop since Feb 8, when it tanked more than 1,000 points. Moreover, the Dow is down 3.1% for the year and 9.99% from its January all-time high. This almost puts it back in correction territory once again.China was prompt in announcing its plans for reciprocal tariffs of $3 billion on imports from the United States in its first response to Trump’s instruction to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to slap tariffs on Chinese imports. Will this enrage China enough to counter the United States, thus triggering a trade war? Let’s see.Our ChoicesUnderstandably, it’s too early to predict the implications of the tariffs or a trade war with China. How long the fears of inflation continue to take a toll on the markets is also hard to predict. In such an event, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks are also mega caps that boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. Such stocks reflect solid financial structure, healthy underlying fundamentals and better quality business.

The stock has returned 39.6% compared with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 15.8% in the past year.Over the past 52 weeks, Consolidated Water’s shares have ranged from a low of $10.15 to a high of $14.90. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.04 million.What's Driving Consolidated Water Higher?Consolidated Water develops & operates seawater desalination plants and engages in water distribution systems. It has operations in the United States as well as in other countries across the globe. To expand its operations, the company is looking for opportunities to tap markets that require potable water.In this regard, the Rosarito project in Mexico is noteworthy. The project encompasses the construction, operation and minority ownership of a 100-million gallon per say seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant. On Mar 7 2018, Consolidated Water announced execution of a subscription agreement for the equity funding required to construct and operate the plant and accompanying pipeline.This indicates the company’s progress in the Rosarito project, which has instilled optimism among investors and culminated into its latest 52-week high share price.It is imperative to mention here successful renewal of several long-term water supply agreements, in which has enabled greater visibility of long-term cash flows, has made the company confident enough to invest in projects like Rosarito. With its fourth-quarter 2017 results scheduled for next week, investors are expecting to come across more such agreements from the company’s part.

236,NEE,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Duke Energy Florida, has filed an application with the Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”) to recoup the expenses incurred by it to restore normalcy of utility services in the state post Hurricane Irma.Hurricane Irma hit Florida on Sep 11, with wind speed of more than 100 miles and knocked out power of 64% or 6.7 million electricity customers in the state, per a date provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Thanks to the continuous hard work of the line and field workers, Duke Energy could restore power to nearly 99% of users in Florida.The company will ask for a restoration cost recovery of $381 million and an additional $132 million to replenish its storm reserve account.Increase in Monthly BillIf approved by the FPSC, the monthly bill of a residential customer consuming 1,000 kWh of electricity will increase $5.20 per month for the expected recovery period of three years. The utility bills of commercial and industrial customers are expected to rise in the range of 2.5% to 6.6%, subject to certain conditions.The storm restoration charge is expected to begin from March 2018 as the commission is expected to provide its decision on the same within next 60 days.Investments Help in RestorationDuke Energy has invested more than $5 billion in Florida since 2004 to strengthen its power delivery system in the Southeast.  These investments helped the company in strengthening its distribution lines, vegetation management and automation of the grid.Another utility, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) through its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) invested nearly $3 billion to strengthen its electricity transmission and distribution capabilities in the state since 2006. FPL already filed with the FPSC to recoup its $1.3 billion expenses in restoration work.All investments made by these companies gave them an opportunity to provide initial resistance against the destruction of Irma. However, the companies had to incur an additional expenditure to restore operation.We expect the recovery of the storm related expenditure to help the utility continue with further investment to strengthen the existing infrastructure and focus more on renewable source to produce electricity.Price MovementDuke Energy has returned 8.2% in the last 12 months, outperforming Zacks Electric Power industry’s rally of 6.6%.The company’s focus on core domestic regulated and highly-contracted renewable business, its stable financial position and streamlining of portfolio will help it deliver a strong performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

237,NEE,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) made an announcement regarding its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.AES Corp has aided and provided assistance to its employees and local communities in Puerto Rico that were critically impacted due to the devastating nature of the hurricanes.Impact of the HurricanesBoth the hurricanes caused significant disruptions to the AES Corp’s Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands operations. Notably, three of the company’s Puerto Rico power plants sustained damages. Its Puerto Rico’s 24 megawatt (MW) solar plant and one of the two units of its 524 MW coal-fired plant were impacted massively. Despite the damages, other unit is still able to generate electricity, while the damaged one is being reviewed.Details of the UpdateAES Corp has provided an update and reaffirmed 2017 guidance for all metrics. The company expects adjusted EPS to be in the lower half of the $1.00 to $1.10 range. An adverse impact of 3 cents to 5 cents is expected on the 2017 adjusted EPS guidance, primarily stemming from the sustained damages to aforementioned power plants and other business interruptions.How Have Utilities Been Impacted?According to BBC News, analysts had initially estimated that the United States will bear an economic cost of $300 billion from hurricane Irma alone. Meanwhile, hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, consequently hitting the company’s business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Toward this, utility operators like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) the operations of which have been impacted due to the hurricanes have started undertaking several restoration steps to normalize operations.We expect impact of the hurricanes to show in third-quarter earnings of most utilities in the broader sector as it has severely affected the infrastructure of the state; nevertheless, investment toward restoration of service areas and infrastructure are likely to hurt the sector a little less than as previously anticipated.Price MovementShares of AES Corp have gained 3.6%, compared to the industry’s increase of 5.4% in the last three months.Weakness in overseas operation is adversely impacting the prospects of the company and cost of adherence to stringent environmental regulations can hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Key PickAES Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

241,NEE,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) announced that it has successfully completed the upgradation of project equipment worth $3 million at a substation in Reading, PA. The equipment upgrade will enable the company to efficiently meet the increasing electrical demands of 2,500 customers in the Glenside area of the city going forward.Details of UpgradesPer the details, the upgradation primarily included the replacement of an old transformer and other equipment built back in 1940. The project upgradation was designed keeping in view the local electric system's capacity without expanding the substation's area or constructing additional power lines.Additionally, novel circuit breakers and relay devices that have been introduced following the revamp will protect equipment by interrupting the flow of electricity against tree-related outages and lightning strikes. Going ahead, the company's dispatchers will monitor conditions at the substation closely to help reduce the duration of outages, a feature that was absent during the time the substation was originally built.Other ProjectsFirstEnergy’s modernization drive has been boosting the company’s service reliability and leading to higher customer retention. To improve the service reliability for its customers in the Penelec and Met-Ed service territories, the company has planned to invest nearly $600 million in transmission projects through 2018. Previously, the company announcedto rebuild and modernize an electric transmission line to enhance service reliability in the Western Pennsylvania region. (Read more: FirstEnergy to Rebuild Transmission Line in Pennsylvania)Additionally, FirstEnergy’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” plan is also aimed at upgrading and expanding its regulated transmission capabilities. Under this initiative, the company is poised to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over the 2017-2021 time period.Our ViewFirstEnergy’s Met-Ed unit currently serves approximately 560,000 customers in 15 Pennsylvania counties. The aforementioned upgradation project is a testament of the company’s focus to meet the growing electrical demands in the Glenside area of Reading.We believe that FirstEnergy’s step toward enhancing service reliability through electrical upgradation and renewing work will aid the company to position itself as a competitive utility operator for sustained customer service-oriented growth. Toward this, we anticipate the company and its subsidiaries alike to deliver safe and reliable electric services along with meeting the growing electrical needs of customers over the times to come.Utility is a regulated, yet highly competitive market. Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure is important for giving better service to the customers. Consequently, apart from FirstEnergy other utility firms like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also taking steps to strengthen existing and replacing old infrastructure to provide better-quality services to customers.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 8.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.2% in the last three months.FirstEnergy’s broadening regulated structure and growing transmission lines are supporting its performance.

242,NEE,"NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) announced its plans to apply federal tax savings toward the Hurricane Irma restoration cost of $1.3 billion. After recovering the costs, the unit anticipates saving each of its 4.9 million customers an average of approximately $250.With the execution of the aforementioned plan, the unit intends to exclude customers from paying a surcharge for Hurricane Irma restoration as previously anticipated. Notably, the company had previously announced its intention to recover $1.3 billion in the form of restoration costs from its large customer base of 4.9 million. This it intended to realize by introducing a surcharge on customer bills through 2020.The unit clearly anticipates realizing the federal tax savings on the back of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which came into effect on Jan 1, 2018. Going ahead, the federal savings will aid FPL to offset the burden of restoration costs due to the hurricanes. Further, it will save its customers from the restoration expenses.Customers Poised to BenefitFPL’s decision to eliminate the previously anticipated surcharge by directing federal tax savings toward consumers is a clear indication of its intention to keep the bill low. Additionally, it has been working relentlessly to provide quality services to customer at best possible prices.Going back to historical data, FPL's typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill has remained low. In fact, FPL's typical customer’s bill is much lower than what it was a decade back.The implementation of the federal tax savings toward a typical FPL's 1,000-kWh customer bill will drop it 30% below the latest national average. This will reduce individual bills by $3.35 a month, effective Mar 1, once the costs of restorations have been recovered. The federal tax benefit will allow customers to enjoy reliable services at a reduced price.We have witnessed some other utilities in the recent past directing the federal tax savings to reduce the bills of customers. Notably, utilities including the likes of AVANGRID, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report), WGL Holdings, Inc.  and ONE Gas, Inc. (OGS  -  Free Report) have expressed intention to pass on the tax savings benefits to customers.Price MovementShares of NextEra Energy have gained 29.8% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 4.9%.Zacks Rank & Key PickNextEra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

243,NEE,"Entergy Corp.’s (ETR  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans, has recently received the New Orleans City Council’s approval to construct a natural-gas fired power plant in the city. Notably, this latest development is in sync with the company’s efforts to include renewable energy in its generation resource portfolio for diversification.About the Plant The New Orleans power station, composed of seven natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, comes with an electricity generation capacity worth 128 megawatt (MW). Entergy expects the plant to commence its services by January 2020.Entergy will invest $210 million in this project, which includes transmission and other project-related costs and contingency. Moreover, it expects to issue a full notice to proceed to the engineering, procurement and construction contractor by end of March 2018.Impressively, the reciprocating engines installed in this plant have self-start capability, thus enabling the company to start the unit even when there is no power on the electric grid. These engines will also help in grid stability and storm restoration by providing a local source of power generation. Markedly, the New Orleans Power Station will use minimal groundwater.Economic Benefits of the PlantApart from generating clean energy, the power plant will help in boosting New Orleans’ economic development. According to Louisiana economist, Dr. Loren Scott, the plant's construction phase will generate new business sales worth $206 million in Orleans Parish and new household earnings worth more than $28 million in for parish residents.Moreover, during the construction, an average of 92 people will get employment per year while the Orleans Parish treasury will gain approximately $1 million in the form of new sales taxes into. On completion, the plant will employ approximately 20 people.Our ViewAfter realizing the fact that alternative energy sources like solar, wind and natural gas are important for future, many electric utilities have started restructuring their generation resource portfolio to include renewable energy. In this context, Entergy is no exception. In fact, we believe the New Orleans power plant is part of the company’s commitment toward pursuing up to 100 MW of renewable resources to serve its New Orleans customers, which account for more than 20,000 individuals.Notably, retail sales of electricity in Louisiana, the state in which New Orleans resides, are among the highest in the United States.  Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report,  total renewables used in the electric power sector are projected to increase 41% in 2018.  Naturally, electricity providers will try to make most of this opportunity and enhance their renewable resource portfolio in this state. Therefore, in line with this, the construction of the natural-gas fired power plant seems to be a strategically efficient decision by Entergy.Furthermore, with Louisiana being one of the top five natural gas-producing states in the country, the New Orleans plant is expected to never run out of natural-gas reserve. This will allow Entergy to cater to the growing demand for electricity in the city and in turn boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Entergy’s shares have gained 4.2% against the broader industry’s decline of 3.7%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined investment in growth projects for the modernization of grid along with evolving customer demand and regulatory support to recover investments. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEntergy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

244,NEE,"Dynegy Inc.  hit a new 52-week high of $13.58 before closing the session a bit lower at $13.38 on Mar 9. Year to date, the stock has delivered an impressive return of about 79.4% compared with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 17.8%.Over the past 52 weeks, Dynegy’s shares have ranged from a low of $5.84 to a high of $13.58. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 3.38 million.What's Driving Dynegy Higher?Dynegy delivered a positive earnings surprise of 103.03% in the fourth quarter. In 2017, Dynegy divested five power generation facilities for $773 million cash. The company used the proceeds and cash in hand to clear outstanding debts of $900 million. Through repayments and refinancing, Dynegy reduced the debt maturity for 2019 to $850 million from $2.1 billion.On Feb 7, 2017, the company completed the acquisition of ENGIE's U.S. portfolio with 9,017 megawatts of predominately gas-fueled generating capacity in the ERCOT, ISO-NE, and PJM markets. This buyout, along with the others since 2013, helped the company convert its generation portfolio to a predominately gas-based one from coal-based.Owing to these positive initiatives, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 moved up 244.8% in the last 60 days.Dynegy’s integration with Vistra Energy (VST  -  Free Report) will result in multiple capital allocation and growth opportunities, which will boost shareholder’s valueZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderDynegy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same industry are CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

245,NEE,"Black Hills Corp.‘s (BKH  -  Free Report) natural gas utility subsidiary announced that it has submitted a review proposal for its natural gas rate, with the Arkansas Public Service Commission.Notably, the review is anticipated to result in a rate increase, which in turn is expected to generate additional revenues of $29.9 million per year, for the company. If the proposal is approved, increased rates for the 166,000 natural gas customers that the company serves across Arkansas will definitely benefit Black Hill’s operating results.Per the filing, the company is seeking to derive a return on equity of 10.2% for investments that Black Hills has been making in its natural gas system in Arkansas. The company is looking forward to implement the new rates in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to approval.Reason for Rate ReviewSince 2016, Black Hills has made investments worth $160 million toward replacing, upgarding and manitaining its natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines in Arkansas, that is stretched over 5,500 miles.Notably these infrastructural investments have been made keeping in view the increasing needs of customers. Further, these have been directed to provide safer and more reliable natural gas delivery services to homes and businesses.Our ViewUtility companies operate in a regulated, yet highly competitive market structure. Upgrading and modernizing infrastructure from time to time is consequently important for providing better service to the customers. Further, investments to improve reliability of existing infrastructure become essential, especially in meeting the ever increasing growth in demand for electricity and other utility services.Being no exception, Black Hills has also made such huge investments, to ensure steady and uninterrupted supply of utility services for its customers in Arkansas. Further, a steady economic growth in Northwest Arkansas might have encouraged the company to invest in this state, for ensuring smoother and improved services.Notably these investments in improving its transmission and distribution system have been paying off well for Black Hills’ operating results, as is evidenced by its performance in the third quarter of 2017. Toward this, Black Hills witnessed an increase of 2.5% in revenues of $342 million.Now, a rate increase aids a utility operator to recover the costs of investments. In recent times, other few utilities have also proceeded in the same path like Black Hills, to enjoy the fruits of hiked rates in the form of enhanced profits.For instance, in June 2017, it was announced that Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report)  is gearing up to place a rate increase request to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for natural gas, which would be effective for three years starting 2018.Price MovementShares of Black Hillshave underperformedthe industry in the last three months. The company’s shares lost 12.3%, against the industry’s gain of 1.3%.Such underperformance can be attributed to lower contribution from the company’s natural gas business that was negatively impacted by lower irrigation demand, during the third quarter of 2017.Zacks RankBlack Hills carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

246,NEE,"Duke Energy’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary Duke Energy Progress recently proposed to increase electricity rates for customers residing in North Carolina. If approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, residential customers will have to pay an additional $5.22 a month for availing services.Details of the Rate HikePer the terms of the proposal, the company aims to hike electric rates by 4.7% in the first four years and an additional 1.3% thereafter. As a result, the annualized bill for a residential customer will increase from the current rate of $10.8.27 per month to $113.49. This hike will also include an increase in the basic customer charge from $11.13 to $14.00 per month.The average net rate increase for the first four years will be 6.2% for residential customers, 5.1 % for the small general service group, 3.1 % for medium general service group and 3.6% for large general service group. After the fourth year, the rates are expected to change to 7.3% for the residential customer group, 6.1 % for the small general service group, 4.7 % for medium general service group and 5.6% for large general service group.Our ViewThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of investing in and generating cleaner electricity by responsibly managing coal ash and improving energy reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Usually, utility providers like Duke Energy files for rate increase to recover costs of investment and thereby extend operations and provide better services. The tax reform implemented by the U.S. government last December, set the stage for this utility’s increased rate base. Notably, lower tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation resulting in lower deferred taxes increases the rate base. As a result, the company expects to witness higher rate base growth for the same level of capital it earlier used to spend, thereby resulting in substantial earnings growth.Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $30 billion in electric utilities and infrastructural growth projects over the 2018-2022 time frame supports this notion. Webelieve such rate base increase, which in turn leads to notable earnings growth, will allow the company to duly achieve its long-term investment targets.Price MovementDuke Energy has lost 7.9% in the last 12 months, compared with the broader industry’s decline of 5.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.   Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry include CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), all of them carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

249,NEE,"FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is seeking authorization to construct the Center for Advanced Energy Technology in Ohio. The facility will be dedicated solely for training employees on digital grid technologies in order to enhance the company's ability to serve customers.FirstEnergy aims to invest approximately $37 million for building the Center, which is to be located next to its existing West Akron campus, OH. Once the necessary permits are sanctioned, the company anticipates the facility to become operational by next spring.Outcome of the ProposalPer the announcement, the new center will be responsible for training FirstEnergy’s employees regarding new grid technologies, which include digital relay devices that are capable of pinpointing the location of equipment failure. With a campus-area of 88,000-square-foot, this facility will also be used to evaluate and test the efficacy of the devices to ensure their compliance with latest industry standards.  Engineers and technicians in this facility will get a hands-on experience, with a simulation for real-world environment, for upgrading and maintaining power grids. Approximately 20-25 employees of the company will be assigned to staff the facility. The Center will provide classroom space for up to 50 trainees.The Center will reinforce the company's efforts to modernize its electric grid that is spread across six states. Notably, this venture is part of FirstEnergy’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” project that was initiated by the company to bolster its power grid and minimize outages. Toward this, the company aims to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under the initiative.In fact, FirstEnergy has been involved with upgradation and replacement of old transmission lines in its service area since 2014. Additionally, it has added newer and smarter technology into the grid, renewed substations with new equipment and enhanced security features for enhancing the quality of electric services. These upgrades are expected to improve its service reliability to customers.Our ViewCurrently, FirstEnergy provides electric services to over 1 million customers in northeast and north central Ohio. Surely, the center once operational will help cater to the needs of FirstEnergy’s Ohio customers and improve the quality of services availed by them.Lately, the company has been strengthening operations in Ohio where it caters to a wide customer base. Toward this, it has neared the completion of a modernization project worth $26 million. (Read more: FirstEnergy Nears Completion of Transmission Project in Ohio)Moreover, the company's Ohio utilities proposed a $450 million investment plan for redesigning and modernization plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for reducing the frequency and duration of power outages at Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating and Toledo Edison divisions. (Read more: FirstEnergy Corp Proposes $450M Modernization Investment)We expect such measures to improve the company's transmission system across its service territory, which in turn will most likely get translated into notable earnings growth for the company. This can be evidenced by FirstEnergy’s performance in the last few quarters. Notably, the company has been successful in delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 4.67% in the trailing four quarters.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 4% outperforming the industry’s growth of 0.7% in the last three months.This can be attributed to the company's focus on continuous upgrading of transmission lines and modernizing efforts in its distribution network, through solid investments.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

250,NEE,"Duke Energy Company’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Duke Energy Florida, recently completed its solar power plant in the Suwannee County of Florida. With a capacity to generate 8.8 megawatts (MW) of solar power, this latest plant adds on to the 4MW solar power (as of December 2016) that this subsidiary has been providing to the Sunshine State.Build on an area of 70 acres, with 44,000 solar panels, this facility commenced its operations last month.Duke Energy Florida’s Solar TargetUnder a recent settlement agreement, Florida Public Service Commission has provided Duke Energy an approval to add up to 700 MW of cost-effective solar power over the next four years. This in turn is projected to expedite the company's previous 10-year solar installation plan.In line with its solar expansion target, the company currently plans to begin construction of its sixth Florida solar power plant in Hamilton County in 2018. The plant, with 300,000 solar panels to be installed in it, will have a capacity to generate 74.9 MW of solar energy.Built on nearly 550 acres of land, the electricity generated from this facility will be able to light up more than 20,000 homes at peak production.Our ViewThe solar industry in the United States is developing rapidly. Since 2008, solar installations in the country recorded 17-fold growth from 1.2 gigawatts (GW) to 30 GW. On the other hand, since 2010, the average cost of solar PV panels has declined more than 60% and the cost of a solar electric system has dropped by about 50%. This has made solar power all the more affordable.Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider offering efficient power and energy services across various states in the United States and other international areas. We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing solar projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.Realizing the expanding market for green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. Duke Energy aims to invest $11 billion to generate energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30 % since 2005. It has set a new goal to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level by 2030. We believe the latest solar plant completion is a step of the company toward achieving this goal.In September 2017, Duke Energy Florida’s service was impacted by Hurricane Irma, which caused significant damage, resulting in approximately 1.3 million customers experiencing outages. The company estimated total storm restoration costs, including capital, of approximately $500 million; which may also increase based on additional information.Considering the fact that Florida is one of only four U.S. states with utility-scale electricity generation from solar thermal technologies and second to Texas in net electricity generation, Duke Energy has ample scope to expand its solar base in the state and recover these costs incurred by its subsidiary in Florida.In this same line, other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) and Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) are also expected to expand their base in solar power production to triumph in the long run, which can pose stiff competition to Duke Energy.Price PerformanceDuke Energy’s stock has returned 12.7% over a year, outperforming the 10.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven by the company’s notable efforts to expand its renewable asset base and new natural gas generation.  Zacks Rank & Key PickDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Consolidated Edison posted an average positive earnings surprise of 0.06% in the trailing four quarters.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

251,NEE,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year.

The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens.

It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date. XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell), with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report)XLU is one of the most popular funds in the utility space.

253,NEE,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) is well positioned for long-term growth on strong economic development in its service areas, and ongoing investment in regulated natural gas and renewable energy assets.Alliant Energy has plans to invest nearly $5 billion during the 2018-2021 time frame. The company is successfully completing major construction projects on time and at or below budget. Constructive regulatory environment will enable the company to recover capital expenditures and thus improve earnings.Alliant Energy currently targets long-term annual earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7%. We expect Alliant Energy to keep up the good performance and achieve the earnings growth target on the back of a number of strategic initiatives undertaken by the company.Nearly 98% of the earnings of the company are generated from regulated operations. The regulated nature of Alliant Energy's operation provides strong earnings visibility, which has enabled the company to increase the annual dividend rate for more than a decade.Despite the strong positives, demand for the utility continues to vary with weather conditions, on which the company has no control. Milder summer and winter months could adversely impact earnings and performance of the company.Alliant Energy is subject to extensive environmental regulations at both federal and state levels.

257,NEE,"FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE  -  Free Report) Ohio utilities recently proposed a redesigning and modernization plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for reducing the frequency and duration of power outages.The initiative targets to invest $450 million investment in three years, to create a stronger distribution system for its customers at Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating and Toledo Edison subsidiaries.Details of the ProposalThe project will encompass circuit ties, reconductoring, reclosers and data acquisition systems. These will prevent power outages, create multiple paths for better power flow to customers and increase distribution line's ability to withstand adverse weather conditions. Additionally, these are projected to restore power faster at times of outages. The proposed projects will also redesign the distribution lines across the company’s services areas in Ohio.Notably, FirstEnergy anticipates the project to reduce outages by approximately 30% or more, on average. It is also projected to speed up restoration time for power lines by approximately 25%.Estimated cost of this project will constitute about 2% of the typical residential customer's monthly bill.FirstEnergy’s Modernization DriveFirstEnergy has been taking steps to upgrade and replace its existing power lines, whenever necessary, since 2014. Further, it has incorporated new, smart technology into the grid and made substations upgrades; to serve customers more efficiently.

258,NEE,"Perennial demand for electricity and utility services has made the Utility Sector a safe haven for investors. Consistent demand enables a smooth flow of cash to utility operators. They in turn use this cash to reward shareholders by paying stable dividends.In fact, for income investors, this sector has always been a lucrative one with utility stocks generating strong dividend yields. As we near the end of 2017, it seems to be a good time for investors to review the prospects of utility stocks and accordingly reshuffle their portfolios.Rising Prices Boost Growth ProspectsIn a recent release, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 3.4% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. This will surely benefit electric utility operators. Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector. Undoubtedly, such price increases will boost earnings of the utilities and enhance dividend payouts.Regular Dividends: A Major PositiveA major positive for utility stocks has been their regular dividend payout strategy. Even during times of recession, households and communities still need power, water, heat and telecommunications. This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008-2009, when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly.We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with shareholders. Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report), which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now.Trump Administration: A Boon Stringent regulations implemented by President Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although for environmental protection Clean Power Plan was an apt decision, it was putting pressures on utilities.  President Trump’s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal. After all, Coal still accounts for nearly 30% of the electricity produced in the United States.Trump’s promises to deregulate the sector and remove environmental hurdles will be beneficial for utilities. Fewer regulations will help to lower operating costs and increase the lives of power production facilities.Key BetsUtility operators are currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source, coal, is gradually being replaced by natural gas and other alternative energy resources like solar power as is evident from increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity.May be realizing that fact that our ultimate future lies in renewable resources, large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy continue to take initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources, even when Trump is against the Clean Power Plan.With only a month or so remaining before we step into 2018, let’s take a look at the utility stocks which continued with their dividend payout strategy amidst this transition.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down our search to the following utility stocks each of which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a dividend yield of more than 3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.First on our list is Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGY  -  Free Report), which provides telecommunications services.

Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.NextEra Energy Beats Q3 Earnings, Guidance UnchangedNextEra Energy, Inc. reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 by 5.7%. Reported earnings were also up 6.3% year over year.The year-over-year growth in earnings was due to solid contribution from both Florida Power & Light Company and NextEra Energy Resources segments. The return was higher, primarily due to new investments made at both segments.On a GAAP basis, NextEra Energy recorded earnings of $1.79 per share, up from $1.62 a year ago. The variance between GAAP and adjusted earnings was primarily due to loss of 13 cents from non-qualifying hedges and merger related expenses of 1 cent. The loss was offset by a one-time gain of 4 cents from income tax expenses, income of 2 cents from Spanish solar projects and 2 cents from other one-time gains.Total RevenuesIn the third quarter, NextEra Energy’s operating revenues were $4,808 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,893 million by nearly 1.7%.

This could be due to the outages caused by Hurricane Irma.Operating income rose 9.4% to $1,399 million from $1,279 million a year ago.Interest expenses in the reported quarter were $381 million, up 3.3% from $369 million in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, Florida Power & Light Company’s average price of electricity went up 10.4% year over year and total average customer count went up 1.3% year over year.Financial UpdateNextEra Energy had cash and cash equivalents of $1,381 million as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $1,292 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2017 was $30.4 billion, up from $27.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.NextEra Energy’s cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2017 was $5,160 million compared with $5,294 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceNextEra Energy reiterated its adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $6.35-$6.85 for 2017 and $6.80-$7.30 for 2018. The company expects earnings to witness a compound annual growth rate of 6-8% per year through 2020, off a 2016 base.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downward momentum. There has been one move higher compared to three lower two months ago.VGM ScoresAt this time, NextEra Energy's stock has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

260,NEE,"With Hurricane Harvey’s devastation still fresh in our minds, another catastrophic tropical storm — Hurricane Irma — hit the shores of Southern U.S., this time affecting the city of Florida in its wake. Although Irma hit the coast of Florida as a Category 4 Hurricane on Sep 10, it has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. However, the damages inflicted by the storm are colossal.As far as the Utilities are concerned, more than 6.2 million Floridians were affected by blackouts, as the companies cut power on grounds of safety. Works pertaining to power restoration have already been initiated by the utility providers but the pace of the same remains a laggard owing to torrential rainfall and subsequent flooding. This in turn is likely to impact few utilities, particularly those supplying power in areas of heavy rainfall like Jacksonville.Economic Impact of Harvey & IrmaAccording to BBC News, analysts initially estimated that the United States will bear an economic cost of $300 billion from Irma alone. However, post hitting Florida, the storm lost intensity driving down loss estimates.Currently, credit rating firm Moody's analysts estimate that Harvey and Irma will lead to around $150-$200 billion loss in the United States and an additional $20-$30 billion economic expenses owing to disruption services. This in turn, forced the firm to downgrade the nation’s Q3 forecast for gross domestic product by half a point to 2.5%.Nevertheless, the fourth quarter is likely to witness improved growth, provided rebuilding efforts are successful.How Have Utilities Been Impacted?There is no denial of the fact that if Irma impacts the whole economy, the Utility sector will be unable to escape its wrath, at least in the near term. Notably, none of the major utilities in Texas, following Harvey, suffered any significant damage in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to advanced infrastructural development.   This time, we notice that utilities that have started vigorous restoration in the Irma affected areas have witnessed a positive movement in their share price. However, some utilities suffered mildly due to damaged grid systems as customers continue to face power outages. Nevertheless, the overall sector is expected to not to suffer much following such hurricanes, in the long term. This is due to the sector’s significant investments toward improving the grid system and transmission and distribution lines, in recent years. In particular, many overhead transmission lines have been changed to undergrounds so they don’t come in the path of such storms.Here we have discussed a handful of primary utility providers in Florida and have tried to ascertain whether they have successfully managed following Irma’s rampage in the state.GainerNextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report): NextEra Energy is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, by Sep 12, Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy had restored power to 2.3 million customers, which was 40% of those affected across Florida. The company announced that customers on the state's east coast can expect power to be restored by about Sept 17. Moreover, its system upgrades have allowed FPL to automatically reroute power and address about 1.5 million outages.Shares of this company inched up 0.6% following Irma’s havoc.LosersDuke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report): Duke Energy is a diversified energy company with a wide portfolio of domestic and international, natural gas and electric and regulated and unregulated businesses which supply, deliver and process energy. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, by Sep 12, the company restored power to only 0.4 million consumers, out of the approximately 1 million customers. It also reported that its electrical system has suffered significant damage in Hardee and Highlands County, as a result of which power restoration will take time.Shares of this company dipped 0.5% following Irma.Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report): Southern Company’s operations include wholesale electricity generation and natural gas services, retail energy services and natural gas storage operations. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The company’s CEO and chairman Thomas Fanning has expressed concerns regarding power restoration in Florida as heavy wind and rainfall have destroyed the state's infrastructure. He revealed that it will take weeks for restoration. In Georgia, almost 1 million of the company’s customers faced power outage.Shares of this company dropped 1.3% post Irma.Valuation Signals More Upside in UtilitiesA valuation analysis of the Utility sector reveals that the stocks are not that expensive at this point, thereby giving room for further upside, in future. The sector currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.8, which is much lower than the high end of 11.6 during the period. Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 10.9. The sector’s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly signals more upside as well.Irma is expected to hamper the third quarter earnings of the sector as the storm has severely affected the infrastructure of the state. Nevertheless, positive valuation metrics hint at strong growth prospects for the utilities in the future, once the effect of Irma wears out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

292,NEE,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) announced that it has filed a stipulation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to invest in clean energy in rural Colorado. The filed stipulation is a broad collaboration between Xcel Energy and 14 other diverse groups.According to the filing, Xcel Energy seeks permission from CPUC to invest approximately $2.5 billion in rural Colorado, to increase its clean energy portfolio. The company has vouched that the approval will not increase customers’ bill.The Colorado Energy PlanXcel Energy stated that their aim is to provide low-cost power and increase the use of cleaner energy in its service area. If approved, the proposal will increase the company’s renewable energy portfolio to 55% by 2026. It will also be very effective in enabling customers to save money and reduce carbon emission by almost 60% by 2026 as compared with 2005 level. As of now, Xcel Energy has lowered its emission level by 30% from 2005 levels and is on track to lower it by 45% through 2021. This proposal may also add up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of wind, 700 MW of solar and 700 MW of natural gas and storage to the company’s portfolio on completion.The company has also asked the commission to consider the early retirement of two 660 MW of coal generation units in southern Colorado. Xcel Energy is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources. To this end, it is planning to invest about $4.2 billion in wind assets over the next three years.Focus on Green Energy by Utility Service ProvidersXcel Energy is not the only company undertaking additional measures to reduce carbon emission by reducing coal usage and increasing use of renewable energy, even when President Trump is actively promoting the usage of coal, to revive the industry.NextEra Energy's (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), has bought out existing contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, thereby saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers and reducing green house gas emission.Another utility giant who is investing heavily in clean power is Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report). The company’s five-year plan includes investment of $3.3 billion in highly-efficient natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. The company has brought down emission level by almost 30% compared to the 2005, by retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewable.With clean energy as the ultimate future, such initiatives adopted by utilities like Xcel Energy will surely help them to capture increased shares in the renewable energy market, which boasts a multi-billion dollar opportunity.Price MovementShares of Xcel Energy have returned 20.1% in the last one year outperforming the industry’s growth of 7.8% in the same time period.Xcel Energy’s disciplined investments in infrastructure projects and focus on renewable expansion might have led to this outperformance.Zacks Ranks and Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

293,NEE,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. Last quarter, this utility company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company commenced 2017 on a solid note by bringing online additional natural gas pipelines during the first few months. Moreover, shares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the industry’s rally in the last three months.NextEra Energy’s, Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) segment has been successful in attracting and adding new customers to its portfolio. Notably, FPL has also enjoyed the benefit of favorable economic conditions in its service territories, especially due to increased demand for utility services. Further, its focus on clean energy has drastically lowered emission levelsand led to significant savings for customers.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy’s revenues is pegged at $4,893 million, indicating 4.01% year over year and 12.4% sequential increase. We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its FPL segment.However, we expect Hurricane Irma to adversely impact the company’s earnings. NextEra Energy’s earnings are projected to be $1.75 per share reflecting a sequential drop by a penny.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.74 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: NextEra is a Zacks Rank #3, increasing the possibility of a beat, but the 0.00% ESP makes it unlikely that this will see fruition this season.As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.NextEra Energy, Inc.

As of Jul 21, 97 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.Combining results of the reported index members (97 members) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest-rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.However, the U.S. coal-based utilities did get a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

302,NEE,"We issued an updated research report on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) on Aug 11. The company started off 2017 on a solid note as more natural gas pipelines came online in the second quarter. Shares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the industry’s rally in the last twelve months. Additionally, earnings per share and total revenue in the second quarter were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to significant contributions from both FPL and NEER segments.The company's steps toward lowering emission levels and saving up on electricity bills for customers have aided it to gain a favorable economic environment. This can be attributable to continued shutting down of coal-fired power plants and addition of a natural gas-fueled plant to lower its carbon footprint.In the last two years, FPL has executed contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, consequently saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers. The company is planning to shut down one more coal unit, subject to approval from Florida Public Service Commission.Through several clean energy initiatives along with focus on increasing production, the company has saved nearly $8.6 billion in fossil fuel costs for customers since 2001. Further, the initiatives have prevented 108 million ton of carbon emission from the power stations.With long-term earnings growth currently pegged at 7.37%, the company is poised well to carry on its strategic initiatives. Further, NextEra Energy continues to work on its long-term investment in clean energy assets. In sync with the strategy, the company announced plans to add nearly 2,100 megawatts (MW) of universal solar generation across Florida over the next several years and construct a modernized highly fuel-efficient natural gas plant near Fort Lauderdale.NextEra Energy has brought nearly 2,500 MW of renewable power in service in 2016 and anticipates bringing nearly 4,900–8,000 MW of new renewable projects online over the 2017–2018 time period.Another company that is benefiting from systematic investments and strategic initiatives is Ameren Corp. (AEE  -  Free Report). Ameren's in-growth projects, infrastructure upgrades, electric transmission and delivery infrastructure are likely to aid in service reliability and generate higher profit.Meanwhile, Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT  -  Free Report) is also well positioned for long-term growth owing to strong economic development in service areas.

These projects are expected to come online during 2018-2020.Coming to its earnings performance, DTE Energy delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. Notably, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings per share is $5.54, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.9%.Meanwhile, DTE Energy operates in Michigan, which has witnessed a gradual economic recovery due to an improvement in employment rates and housing and auto markets. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, which in turn is expected to bolster the company’s growth.The company’s focus on improving its cost structure and directing capital investments toward renewable generation, utility infrastructure and environmental compliance assets have led it to outperform its broader market. Evidently, DTE Energy’s share price increased 9.8% over a year compared with the industry’s 6.4% growth.  On the flip side, despite investing substantially in renewable projects, increasingly stringent government regulations for curbing emissions remains a major cause of concern for DTE Energy.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksDTE Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are NextEra Energy, Inc.

307,NEE,"With the Q3 earnings season kicking off, Utility companies are preparing to release their numbers in the next couple of weeks. Notably, the Zacks Utility sector gained 3% in the third quarter.Factors Boosting the UtilitiesA major factor which boosts the utility sector is that there exists no substitute for the energy-related services rendered by the utilities. The endless demand for electricity and utility services will never cease to exist, thereby conferring a consistent flow of revenue to these companies. Thus utilities are considered as a safe haven.Utilities generate more or less stable earnings unless any sudden event impacts their operations adversely. This regulated nature of operations provide them stability and in turn they reward their shareholders with steady dividend rates.Moreover, the predominant domestic focus shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues. Also the major utility providers make frequent modernizations of their grid system and distribution networks to offer seamless flow of electricity to customers. In fact, it is these modernization initiatives that saved the grid systems from getting severely damaged from the widespread hurricane rampage that hit the coastal U.S. in the last couple of months.Further, stringent emission regulations implemented by Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although it is a favorable development from the environmental point of view, utilities had to make huge investments to ease the transition to renewables.However, President Trump’s recent initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan on economic growth grounds is expected to give a temporary breather to utilities that produce major part of their electricity from coal.On the other hand, realizing the need for clean energy a number of major utility providers like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) have already taken initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources. Considering the fact that renewable energy is the ultimate future of energy resources, these initiatives will boost the growth of alternative-energy utilities, in the long run.We believe, over time, a constructive utility-rate environment and increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewable sources will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.Earnings Expectations for UtilitiesPer our Earnings Trend, as of Oct 11, Q3 earnings for the Utility sector is expected to be down 2.9%, while sales for the same is estimated to be up by 1.5%. Operations of major utilities like NextEra, Duke Energy and American Electric Power Corporation (AEP  -  Free Report) that have extensive business in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida were affected adversely. Although a minor section of their grid system got damaged severely, they were compelled to stall electricity distribution. These outages are expected to weigh on their Q3 earnings, which in turn may have dragged down this sector’s overall earnings expectation for the quarter.Nevertheless, going ahead, in 2017, this sector is expected to exhibit an earnings improvement of 2.1% and sales growth of 4.4%. This indicates an improvement in the results of these stocks ahead of Q3.How to Identify Potential Winners Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Moreover, investors constantly seek stocks that not only maintain stability but produce respectable returns for shareholders. Keeping that in mind, we have herein added Return on Equity (ROE) in our selection criteria for screening high cash returning utility stocks that are poised to beat Q3 earnings.5 Solid Bets Here are five utility stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises, with a ROE greater than 10%, in their upcoming announcements:BCE, Inc.

312,NEE,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 26. Last quarter, this utility reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDespite the ill-effects of Hurricane Irma, that hampered the financial performance of many utilities, the economy of Florida remains sturdy, supporting ongoing customer growth in the last two quarters. This can be attributed to new construction and additional building permits. Overall, Florida's economy continues to flourish and could result in more customer additions.NextEra Energy anticipates lower growth in the fourth quarter due to refinancing initiatives. Further it anticipates the favorable economic conditions to drive NPV savings up to $150 million on a cash basis but with simultaneous reduction in net income.Despite an expected drop in net income, management believes that it is well positioned to achieve 6-8% annual adjusted earnings per share growth off 2016 base.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate is at $1.29 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.30 per share resulting in Earnings ESP of -1.15%.Zacks Rank: NextEra Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though the Zacks Rank #3 increases the possibility of a beat, an ESP of -1.15% makes it unlikely this season.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.NextEra Energy, Inc.

The above program is anticipated to promote enhanced service reliability by helping guard against growing vegetation. Over 2,500 circuit miles of tree trimming has been undertaken and another 1,100 miles is currently underway.The Vegetation ProgramIn the electric utility industry, growing vegetation is a leading cause of power outages.  As such JCP&L’s tree-care maintenance program helps to keep vegetation away from power lines and other electric equipment.Although the vegetation management work is an expensive maintenance cost, it is essential for utility providers to take steps for providing safe and reliable service to customers. As such, the company’s tree management program since 2003, has helped to reduce tree-related outages in New Jersey service by nearly 24%.JCP&L currently serves approximately 1.1 million customers in central and northern New Jersey. JCP&L’s tree-care maintenance program is testament to FirstEnergy’s focus in providing the customers reliable and outage free power services. Toward this, the company has plans to invest nearly $600 million transmission projects through 2018.Going forward, we expect such initiatives to aid the company to retain existing customers’ while adding more customers as it continues to take steps for enhancing the quality of services.FirstEnergy’s Step toward Customer RetentionUtility is a regulated, yet highly competitive market. Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure is important for giving better service to the customers. Consequently, apart from FirstEnergy other utility firms like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also strengthening infrastructure to provide better-quality services to customer base.We believe that FirstEnergy’s regulated growth strategies along with its step toward enhancing service reliability through the tree trimming program will aid the company to position itself as a successful utility operator for sustained customer service-oriented growth.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

314,NEE,"Dynegy Inc.  recently announced the closure of $119 million sale transaction of its Dighton & Milford energy facilities to Starwood Energy Group Global.Per the deal, proceeds generated will be used toward debt reduction purposes.Dynegy’s Effortsto Reduce DebtDynegy has been working on reducing its debt burden for quite some time now. The sale of its Dighton & Milford energy assets will aid the company to lower debt level and is in line with the steps taken by the company to strengthen balance sheet and lower the cost of servicing its debt capital.The company exited the second quarter with total long-term debt of $9.2 billion as of June 30, 2017 compared with nearly $8.8 million at the end of 2016. Even with significant debt reduction steps undertaken by it early on during the year, the company’s debt-to-capital ratio is currently pegged at 79.16%, much higher than the S&P 500 level of 41.80%.During the month of July, Dynegy had made the announcement of its intention to divest approximately $780 worth of assets and use the sale proceeds for reducing debt burden. (Read more: Dynegy  to Sell Assets Worth $780M to Lower Debt Burden)Going ForwardThe company has a reputation of being the lowest cost operator in the country. With its current aim of lowering debt burden, the company has directed focus to make the most of its current fleet and utilize outside resources to help bolster current efforts to deliver cost efficient power to customers.Toward this, the company has been taking steps to exceed expectations with its PRIDE (Producing Results through Innovation by Dynegy Employees) program and looking for opportunities to launch the next phase. The PRIDE program was launched to drive recurring cash flow benefits and improve balance sheet efficiency of the company by optimizing cost structure along with implementing process and operating improvements.It currently serves approximately 550 communities across Illinois, Massachusetts & Ohio, and is further anticipating to expand generation portfolio and footprint across more states.Price MovementDynegy has lost 25.8% in the last 12 months, significantly lower than the 6.4% gain of its industry.Such underperformance can be attributed to Dynegy’s existing debt burden.

315,NEE,"PNM Resources (PNM  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the shutdown of two coal fired units of San Juan Generating Station (SJGS) near Farmington, NM. The move is expected to lower carbon emission and reduce usage of coal and water by nearly 50%.The shutdown of the coal fired units was per agreement, under the Revised State Implementation Plan (Revised SIP) and reduction of output by nearly 836 megawatt (MW). The company aims to replenish the loss of production through additional generation from renewable energy, existing nuclear power and natural gas.Emissions & Utilities Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) release, the overall emission of carbon dioxide declined 1.7% in 2016 and 0.8% in 2017, courtesy of the initiatives undertaken by the utilities. However, EIA carbon dioxide emission is to rise 1.8% in 2018, due to higher coal usage.The coal friendly move from the new U.S. administration and likely hike in natural gas prices are going to increase usage of coal in utilities thereby increasing the emission levels.However, utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report),  Dominion Resources  (D  -  Free Report) and  Duke Energy Corporation  (DUK  -  Free Report) have already invested  and plan to spend more  to create green energy generation portfolio. Even without Clean Power Plan, utilities are focusing on investment in renewable energy and natural gas-based generation.  The utilities are also closing old coal fired production units paving way for further decline in emission.PNM Resources’ Long-Term GoalsManagement expects 2018 and 2019 earnings in the range of $1.70-$1.80 and $2.00-$2.16, respectively. The company aims to invest nearly $2.7 billion during 2018-2022 period, which will strengthen infrastructure and renewable generation.The company is targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio in the range of 50-60% and is aiming for an average annual earnings growth of 6% in 2017 to 2021 period.Price Movement                                                  PNM Resources has outperformed the industry in the last six months. The company’s shares have gained 24.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 7.0%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s impressive results and strong cash generating ability.Zacks RankPNM Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

FirstEnergy’s transmission modernization drive will boost the company’s service reliability and lead to customer retentionWill it be Beneficial?FirstEnergy being a major electric utility has been rigorously working on exiting the competitive energy market and becoming a fully regulated utility to tab the benefits of a regulated Utility Service Area.In a regulated and highly competitive utility market, enhanced service reliability, reduced power outage and advanced technology are the keys to customer satisfaction.FirstEnergy has spent approximately $2 billion in Regulated Transmissions in the last two years. As such, it has announced plans to begin the Phase-2 of their initiative through 2021, amounting to approximately $4.2-$5.8 billion over the next five years. These investments will benefit the communities on the whole by enhancing service reliability across the entire system.FirstEnergy has been performing fairly well during the last three years, in addition it has taken initiatives to convert its competitive business to regulated business by mid- 2018.

319,NEE,"On Nov 15, 2017, we issued an updated research report on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report).The company is benefiting from its focus on clean energy. NextEra Energy has lowered emission levels and is trying to reduce energy bills for customers. However, impacts of unpredictable natural disasters remain a headwind. Notably, its $3-billion infrastructure investment in the last 11 years in Florida has cushioned it against significant electric infrastructure losses.NextEra Energy’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings surpassed estimates by 5.7% on the back of solid contribution and investments from its segments — Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) and NextEra Energy Resources (NER).NextEra Energy is on track with its business strategies. The company makes long-term investments in clean energy assets with plans to put in $40-$44 billion in projects during 2017-2020. In line with this strategy, the company announced plans to generate an additional 1,400-3,800 megawatt (MW) of solar generation in the United States over the next few years.NextEra Energy's current renewal energy development program aims at bringing 10,100-16,500 MW of new renewable projects online (including wind repowering) during 2017-2020.In the last two years, FPL has entered into agreements to shut two independent coal-fired power plants, with the aim of saving additional costs for customers. This is expected to result in $183 million in savings for FPL customers and reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 5.6 million tons.However, the company's business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations. Additionally, its subsidiaries depend on regulatory bodies for rate relief and cost recovery approvals. As a result, NextEra Energy’s current capital projects might get hampered by delays. This will lead to cost overruns and hurt the company’s profits.Additionally, the company's subsidiary NEER's dependence on government policies and budgetary constraints may lead to delay and reduced returns through investment losses. Additionally, increasing indirect input costs are also among the other headwinds for the company.Price MovementNextEra Energy has outperformed the industry in the three months. The company’s shares gained 66.4% compared with the industry’s advance of 18.9%.Zacks Rank & Key Picks               NextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

320,NEE,"FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries recently completed inspection operations and maintenance services of its equipments, in a bid to ensure operational reliability in its service territory, before winter arrives next month in the United States.Currently the company operates in six states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and West Virginia — wherein FirstEnergy undertook these maintenance initiatives.Details of the Maintenance WorkMaintenance work was carried out by FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries — Ohio Edison (OE), Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), Toledo Edison (TE), Penelec (PN), Met-Ed (ME), Penn Power (PP), West Penn Power (WP), Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L), Monongahela Power Company (MP) and The Potomac Edison Company (PE).The company’s operations included the inspection of heating equipment for substation components. Additional inspection was carried out for batteries as well as motors of these equipments. An equipment survey was carried out to check overheating and malfunctioning in case the heaters get cranked up for higher usage.Company bucket trucks and other vehicles are also checked to ensure safe operation during the winter, while a thorough tree trimming across the year has been FirstEnergy’s custom for maintaining proper clearances around electrical systems. This in turn offers protection against tree-related outages.Notably, the company conducted helicopter patrols to lookout for damaged wire, broken cross arms, failed insulators and other hardware problems across the transmission lines located in its entire service area.FirstEnergy’s Reliability Measures - Not NewTo enhance service reliability, it has been a common practice for FirstEnergy to conduct maintenance work like the aforementioned one, each year before the winter season arrives. In fact, since 2014, FirstEnergy has been focusing on modernization efforts to upgrade or replace existing power lines, incorporate new, smart technology into the grid and substations upgrades; to serve customers more efficiently.This led to the company’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” plan for upgrading and expanding regulated transmission capabilities. FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under the initiative.Our ViewColder weather conditions increase the demand for electricity. However, heavy snow and winds can cause damage to wires and substations as well as transmission lines, thereby causing disruptions in electricity supply. Therefore, conducting inspections and maintenance of equipment before the onset of winter helps to minimize infrastructural damage and ensures better service.Following this strategy, FirstEnergy is conducting maintenance work across its service territory. Additionally, FirstEnergy has plans to transform itself into a complete regulated utility by mid-2018. The aforementioned efforts and investments to prepare for winters in its regulated operations are anticipated to aid this transformation.In line with this, we may expect other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) to undertake similar steps to carry out maintenance and reliability operations.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 7.2% outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.0% in the last three months.This was been driven by the company’s strong focus on upgrading its transmission lines and moderninzing its distribution network, through solid investments.Zacks RankFirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

During the second quarter, it completed the acquisition of 250 megawatts (MW) Golden West Wind project from NextEra Energy Resources for approximately $238 million.Why Renewable Energy?With global warming on the rise, it is important to plan energy consumption carefully. It is important to note that non-renewable energy sources are limited and will be exhausted in the near future. Therefore, major energy providers like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) and others are gradually switching to low or no-emission energy resources, such as solar, wind, hydro etc., which are available abundantly.According to U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2016, approximately 10% of total energy consumption in the United States was from renewable energy sources. We expect contribution from the renewable sources to the total generation mix to rise due to lower cost of power production from renewable sources and government’s initiatives to provide more impetus to renewable generation projects.Price MovementUnits of NextEra Energy Partners have returned 49%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 14.6% in the last one year.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s growing renewable portfolio which has boosted its performance.Zacks RankNextEra Energy Partners carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

327,NEE,"Hurricane Irma, which is now a Category 4 storm, is making its way toward the Sunshine State Florida and the Southeast United States after wrecking Caribbean Islands. The storm, one of the strongest Atlantic Ocean hurricanes ever recorded, is expected to hit the United States this weekend.Hurricane Irma might lose some of its intensity when it hits Florida but will still have enough strength to cause major damages. The administration and the utilities are preparing themselves to deal with these extreme weather conditions.Lessons Learned from Hurricane WilmaFlorida is no stranger to devastating hurricanes and extreme weather. Hurricane Wilma hit Florida in October 2005 and resulted in mass scale power outages. Overall damages were valued in excess of $20 billion. People were without power for weeks as thousands of wooden power poles were uprooted by the storm.The utilities operating in the region have learned a difficult lesson from Wilma and worked to strengthen the infrastructure to counter natural calamities in the future. Utilities like Duke Energy Corp. and NextEra Energy have invested billions of dollars to strengthen their operations.Florida Public Service Commission, post the Wilma devastation, had directed utilities to fortify infrastructure and provide power to customers during natural disasters.Utilities Showed Resilience Against Hurricane HarveyAccording to Electric Reliability Council of Texas’ report, none of the major utilities in this area have suffered any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to the advanced infrastructural development.Florida Utilities Ready to Face IrmaAs Irma might cause massive damages to the utility infrastructure, Utility workers, who worked tirelessly to keep the utility service running in Texas after Hurricane Harvey, are gradually moving toward Florida.Stocks to Bet onDuke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report): Duke Energy has regulated utility operation in Florida and has invested more than $5 billion since 2004 to strengthen its power delivery system in the Southeast.  The company has been preparing for the storm by strengthening its distribution lines, vegetation management and automation of the grid.Duke Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company is ready to shut down its four nuclear reactors as a precautionary measure as the storm approaches. The spokesperson of FPL said that the company has nearly 15,000 crew members to help in restoration of power in Florida. Since 2006, FPL has invested nearly $3 billion to strengthen its electricity transmission and distribution capabilities in the state.NextEra shares lost have 0.5% over the last three days versus 0.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.Our TakeAs the old saying goes, “Nature Always has the Last Laugh.” However, through the technological advancements we now have the ability to correctly predict the intensity of the storm and where it is going to hit. This gives us the chance to prepare well ahead of time.  Every storm is unique and destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey is a stark reminder what nature can do to us.Florida has seen ample investment in solar energy from Duke Energy, NextEra Energy and Tampa Electric. The solar panels are built to survive in harsh conditions, but will they be able to survive in Hurricane Irma’s 150+ mph strong winds?Hurricanes likes these are a big threat to Florida’s plan of adding more green energy in its system. It could put to test the investments made in Florida electricity infrastructure over the last decade. We need to wait and see whether the power infrastructure is capable of holding its ground during Irma’s onslaught and the impact of Hurricane Jose, a Category 3 storm currently following the path of Irma.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

332,NEE,"FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) announced that the agreement for the sale of competitive natural gas and hydroelectric generation assets to LS Power Equity Partners III, LP has been revised by both companies. Per the revised agreement, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC, and Allegheny Generating Company, will sell 1,615 megawatts (MW) of assets located in Pennsylvania and Virginia to a subsidiary of LS Power Equity Partners III, LP for $825 million.According to the previous agreement that was signed in January 2017, FirstEnergy agreed to sell assets with 1,572 MW capacity for $925 million.Terms of the AgreementThe power stations which will be the part of the transaction are Springdale Generating Facility Units 1-5 (Springdale Township, PA), Chambersburg Generating Facility Units 12-13 (Guildford Township, PA), Gans Generating Facility Units 8-9 (Hunlock Creek, PA) and Hunlock Creek (Hunlock Creek, PA).Apart from these four facilities, the deal also includes a part of Allegheny Generating Company's ownership interest in the Bath County Hydro station and the indirect interest of Allegheny Energy Supply in a joint venture with Buchanan Generating Facility (Oakwood, VA).The agreement also states that all the 20 employees working at these power stations will retain their jobs with the new owner.Moving Away From Competitive GenerationThis step is a part of FirstEnergy’s earlier mentioned strategy to reduce merchant fleet generation so as to cushion itself from market volatilities. With the sale of these assets, the company will move a step closer toward its strategy of operating as a fully regulated utility company and exit from commodity-exposed generation.Once the entire transition is complete, the company’s owned or generating capacity will be approximately 15,337 MW from nuclear, coal, gas, hydro, wind and solar facilities. The company is aiming to transform into a regulated company by mid 2018.Growing Amid Steep CompetitionFirstEnergy’s modernization drive has given rise to its ambitious plan “Energizing the Future”.

Even with the debt reduction initiatives, the debt-to-capital ratio of the company is presently 79.16%, much higher than the S&P 500 level of 41.80%.Given the ongoing increase in interest rate, the rising debt levels can adversely impact the performance of the company. We believe Dynegy should continue with debt restructuring initiatives to improve capital structure and create long-term value for shareholders.Price MovementDynegy has underperformed the industry in the last twelve months. The company’s shares lost 21.5% against the industry’s gain of 8.2%.The price underperformance can be attributed to the earnings volatility that Dynegy has been facing for quite some time now, due to volatility in supply, fuel price volatility, interest rates, and other seasonal factors.Stocks to ConsiderDynegy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors can consider better-ranked stocks like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) from the same industry. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

340,NEE,"Californian utility provider Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) is set to buy Texas’ electrical grid giant Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor). The move came after Sempra Energy confirmed to acquire Oncor’s parent company, Energy Future Holdings Corp., on Aug 21.Per media sources, by signing the deal, Sempra Energy practically snatched away Oncor from Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) that has been bidding for this regulated utility, since July.Details of the DealIncluding Oncor’s debt, the enterprise value of Sempra's proposed offer for Oncor is $18.8 billion. Excluding debt, Sempra Energy will pay cash worth $9.45 billion for ownership rights of Energy Future as well as Oncor.To fund the $9.45 billion cash, Sempra Energy plans to combine its own debt and equity, third-party equity, and $3 billion of expected investment-grade debt at the reorganized holding company. Sempra Energy expects its equity ownership after the transaction to be approximately 60% of the reorganized Energy Future company.The buyout, expected to be over by the first half of 2018, will be accretive to Sempra Energy's earnings beginning in 2018. However, the deal remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval from a handful of the U.S. regulatory authorities.Post the buyout, Sempra Energy will maintain the existing independence of Oncor's board of directors. On completion, the Oncor board will consist of 13 directors, including seven independent directors from Texas, two from existing equity holders and two from the new Sempra Energy-led holding company.Benefits of the BuyoutThe Oncor buyout will add Texas’ largest electric transmission and distribution provider to Sempra Energy’s portfolio, thereby expanding its market in the state where it currently operates only 10 power plants. Apart from expanding the company’s regulated earnings base, this deal will boost Sempra Energy’s future growth in the Texas energy market and U.S. Gulf Coast region.Although Energy Future has been suffering from bankruptcy issues since 2014,Oncor that earned $431 million of profit last year has always been considered a viable investment option. Notably, Oncor’s plants provides electricity to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses in Texas and with its acquisition Sempra Energy’s customer base is thus poised to grow.Moreover, per terms of the agreement, Sempra Energy will support Oncor's plan to invest $7.5 billion of capital over a five-year period to expand and reinforce its transmission and distribution network. This in turn will enhance the service territory of Oncor and in turn, Sempra Energy, thereby adding opportunity to earn more profit.Our Take on the AcquisitionIt is interesting to note that this is the fourth time that that an acquisition attempt has been made for Oncor. Last month, Berkshire Hathaway aimed to buy Oncor. In April, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) made an attempt to take over Oncor but failed to progress amid concerns from the Public Utility Commission of Texas. A buyout attempt last year backed by the Ray Hunt family of Dallas also faltered.However, this time, Elliott Management Corp. played a vital role in the finalization of the Oncor-takeover deal, with it being the largest creditor of bankrupt Energy Future Holdings. In fact, Elliott strongly opposed Berkshire Hathaway’s $18 billion offer, including debt, made in July, arguing it to be an undervalued one and not in creditors’ interest. On the contrary, the corporation backed Sempra’s bid for Oncor saying this time the proposal offers greater returns than offered by Berkshire.We believe the Oncor buyout to be a profitable strategic fit for Sempra Energy and will bolster the company's utility and energy infrastructure businesses, once integration is over post acquisition.Price PerformanceSempra Energy has outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the last one year. During this period, the company’s shares have rallied 9.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 8.4%. This might have been driven by the systematic investments that Sempra Energy makes in its infrastructure development projects.Zacks Rank & Key PickSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
