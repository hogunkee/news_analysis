15,NFX,"A mixed finish Wednesday marked what was in many ways a single-handed victory for Apple (AAPL), as it lugged the Dow above the 22,000 mark, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 ended mostly unchanged.XThe iPhone maker thundered ahead 5% in massive trade, paring its initial 6% advance only slightly, and ending the session 1% above a 156.65 buy point in a flat base.The result left the Dow Jones industrial average with a 0.2% gain, and remaining ever-so-slightly above the 22,000 level after seizing that new high-water mark in opening trade. More than half of the Dow's 30 stocks traded lower for the day.

Drug distribution giant Cardinal Health (CAH) also had some say, dropping 8% after topping fiscal fourth-quarter expectations, but guiding Q1 earnings below expectations.Aside from Apple, the day's big earnings winners were Illumina, Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) and Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT).Illumina soared 15% after reporting late Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings slipped much less than expected and revenue growth ratcheted up to 10%.

Its 18% gain launched shares past a 61.52 buy point in a five-month cup-with-handle base.Truck maker Oshkosh (OSK) pared its initial 12% surge to a 5% gain, enough to hold just above a 71.84 buy point in a cup-with-handle base after reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings up 63%, far above analyst targets and the company's best outing in four years.The session also saw winning runs break down for several leading stocks, most notably Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) and Coherent (COHR).Chipmaker Macom sliced off a 25% loss after compounding a weak fiscal Q3 report with below-target Q4 guidance.

That estimate had helped send oil prices up nearly 2% on Tuesday.Oil was already being closely watched early Wednesday, as tensions rose in the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had effectively blockaded Qatar, and after reports of multiple armed attacks on official buildings in Tehran, Iran, that reportedly left at least 12 dead. News reports said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks.As a result, U.S.-based oil benchmarks led the declines, with West Texas Intermediate crude ending down nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel, its lowest mark since early May.On the stock market, oil-related groups took six of the session's 10 worst losses among industries. Drilling, U.S. E&P and field services were hardest hit.Airlines had one of the day's best performances, with Hawaiian Holdings (HA) surging 12% to break out above a 56.25 buy point. The owner of Hawaiian Airlines reported stronger-than-expected passenger traffic in May. Brazil-based Gol Intelligent Airlines (GOL) jumped 5% in weak trade.Oil plays took nine of the 10 hardest falls among S&P 500 stocks. Newfield Exploration (NFX) and Helmerich & Payne (HP) each fell about 6%. Also among those tumbles was beer-maker Molson Brewing (TAP), which tanked 6.5%.Near the top of the list, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) swung up more than 3% in moderate trade. The move was enough to clear a 62.08 flat-base buy point, but volume was only 20% above average – not enough to qualify as a breakout. Volume can sometimes kick in a day or two after a stock passes a buy point, confirming a breakout after the fact.Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) were among the Dow industrials to rise 1% or more. UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend to 75 cents a share and Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock with an overweight rating and a 202 price target.Coca-Cola (KO) dropped to the bottom of the list, down 1%, pressured by a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform.China-based stocks posted a strong session, with NetEase leading the Nasdaq 100 with a 3% gain in powerful trade. Standpoint Research trimmed the stock's rating to reduce, from buy, but also upped its price target to 360 from 345.On the IBD 50 list, New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) led, up 9% and 5% respectively. New Oriental remained extended and working on its eighth-straight weekly gain. TAL is extended after a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.RELATED:Oil Tumbles On Surprise U.S. Stockpile BuildHow Markets Got The Jobs Report Completely Wrong

17,NFX,"The Nasdaq and S&P defended narrow gains into Wednesday's close, aided by earnings results and rising oil prices. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.2%, weighed by Walt Disney (DIS) and Boeing's (BA) sharp losses.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each squeezed out gains of 0.1%. Small caps had a positive session, with the Russell 2000 marking off a 0.6% advance.The two biggest moves among S&P 500 stocks were earnings-related: Nvidia (NVDA) and Electronic Arts (EA).  Six of the next 10 largest moves were oil-related stocks, with Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) leading that charge.Chevron (CVX) led the Dow with a 1.4% gain. Caterpillar (CAT) rose more than 1%. But that wasn't enough to counter the downdraft from the declines of Boeing, down 1.3%, and Disney, which dropped 2.2% after reporting disappointing fiscal second-quarter results late Tuesday.Boeing fell after announcing it would ground test flights of its 737 Max aircraft to check for a possible engine component defect. The aircraft have not yet been delivered to airlines, with the first deliveries scheduled for this month.Other heavyweights dragging on Wednesday's market action included Priceline Group (PLCN), down 4.5% on mixed first-quarter results. The heavy-volume decline found support at the stock's 10-week moving average.Oil groups ended the day with three of the five largest gains among industries after crude oil prices rebounded more than 3%. Data showed an unexpected drop in weekly stockpiles.  The computer gaming group outpaced even the oil groups, as Electronic Arts surged 13% after trouncing analyst expectations in its fiscal fourth-quarter report.  Shares were already extended above a flat base buy point of 91.91.The fabless chipmakers group scored high, riding Nvidia's 18% gain. Processors for cloud computing data centers helped drive the chip innovator's first quarter revenue up 48% and earnings to an 85% advance, both well above analyst expectations. The move sent the IBD 50 stock to just below a 121.02 buy point in a late-stage base.Laser maker Coherent (COHR) soared 14% on healthy earnings results reported late Tuesday.  Coherent entered the session extended from a rebound off support at its 10-week moving average in April.After the close, Snap (SNAP) toppled 24% after reporting a wider-than-anticipated $2.2 billion loss. Revenue rose 286%, much better than analyst estimates. Daily active users grew 36% to 166 million, in line with expectations. Snapchat shares ended Wednesday's session 35% above their March IPO price of 17 a share.RELATED:After Snap, These Unicorns Follow: Investing Action Plan

18,NFX,"XThe extension of a deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC countries to trim output isn't a foregone conclusion, Saudi Arabia reportedly warned top U.S. shale firms this week, in a sign that the No. 1 crude exporter's strategy to lift prices may be backfiring in the face of surging U.S. producers.In a closed-door meeting with executives from Anadarko Petroleum (APC), ConocoPhillips (COP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), EOG Resources (EOG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) on Tuesday, top Saudi officials said U.S. producers should ""not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts"" and that OPEC ""would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production,"" an executive at the meeting told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. crude futures fell 2% to settle at $49.28 a barrel, its lowest close since November, after tumbling more than 5% Wednesday. Brent futures fell 1.7% to $52.19.Late last year, OPEC and non-members like Russia agreed to trim output by a collective 1.8 million barrels a day for the first six months of this year. While crude prices surged leading up to and immediately after the deal was reached, they later stayed sideways as U.S. companies rushed to add drilling rigs and crank up production.With the deal's upside fizzling out, OPEC member Iraq had starting talking about an extension when the agreement expires in June. And on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih appeared to lay out an initial, albeit tough, negotiating position.He told IHS' CERAWeek energy conference attendees Tuesday that ""conformity by all"" will be a criterion for any extension of the production-cut pact and that his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" as Saudi Arabia takes the brunt of the production cuts.Anadarko shares rose 0.9% to 61.94 on the stock market today. Conoco shares were up 1.2%. Occidental edged up 0.7%. Pioneer Natural climbed 1.9%. EOG was up 0.9%. Newfield jumped 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Failure to extend the agreement could send oil prices even lower, as U.S. companies have vowed to unleash a flood of investment this year to pump more oil from low-cost formations like the Permian Basin.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million. Last week, U.S. output hit 9.09 million barrels, the highest in a year and a half.Saudi Arabia's warning to U.S. shale comes despite strong compliance with the terms of the current agreement.Last month, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said he wants compliance on the output deal to rise past 90% to nearly 100%.But the high number is a collective figure and was due in part to Saudi Arabia cutting its output by more than it was expected, offsetting weaker compliance elsewhere.During an interview with CNBC after his speech, Al-Falih said Russia's cuts in February weren't enough but that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak assured him that March cuts will be better.OPEC's next meeting is scheduled for May 25, and on March 26 a committee formed to monitor compliance with the production deal will meet in Kuwait.RELATED:Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?This Is When Shell Expects Global Peak Oil DemandDow's Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Announce Energy Deals As Oil Undercuts $50

62,NFX,"EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 12 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also improved from a loss of 28 cents in the prior-year quarter. EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation Quote Which Way are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised downward over the last 30 days, with one firm being bullish and five firms taking a bearish stance. The figure reflects a year-over-year decline of 12%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $886.5 million for the fourth quarter, up 133.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderPer the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is pegged at 2,860 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,229 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,157 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for oil sales volume per day is 295 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), showing an improvement of 246 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect natural gas volumes per day of 235 mcf, increasing from 205 mcf in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas liquids sales volume per day is 5,148 Mboe/d, up from 3,176 Mboe/d in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in Production segment is pegged $812 million, showing an increase from $598 million in the last quarter and $318 million in the year-ago quarter.During 2017, EQT is likely to spend $1.5 billion, out of which $1.3 billion will be allocated to well developments. A total of 207 wells will be drilled comprising 119 Marcellus wells. The entire funding will be done through cash on hand and operating cash flow, reflecting the company’s strong balance sheet.However, during the first nine months of 2017, EQT’s expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 61%. If the trend continues, the company’s revenues might be hurt.Moreover, EQT lacks geographical diversification as its resources are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. This increases risk exposure of the company as any disruptions in the region will affect financials.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, EQT has underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 12.8% against the industry's rally of 9%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: EQT has an Earnings ESP of -7.32% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 22 cents.

These have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

63,NFX,"Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the upstream energy player posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.4%. Moreover, Cimarex Energy delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.3% in the last four quarters. Cimarex Energy Co Price and EPS Surprise  Cimarex Energy Co Price and EPS Surprise | Cimarex Energy Co Quote Which Way Are the Estimates Trending?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with 18 firms being bullish and three firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects year-over-year improvement of 130%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $534.7 million in the upcoming results, showing an increase of 39.9% from the year-ago quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model does not show that Cimarex Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Cimarex Energy’s Earnings ESP is +0.88%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.39, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.38. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.       Zacks Rank: Cimarex Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3.  Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cimarex Energy’s Zacks Rank #3 and +0.88% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.  What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Cimarex Energy’s asset quality is one of the best among its peers. The Woodford shale wells in its Lone Rock area, the Wolfcamp wells in Texas and the acreage in Eddy County have had outstanding results during the third quarter. These regions are expected to continue producing superior results in the to-be-reported quarter.Cimarex Energy’s financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets in this period of economic uncertainty. The company has no current debt while long-term debt has been contracting steadily since 2017, reflecting balance sheet strength.However, Cimarex Energy’s long-term production and reserve growth primarily depend on its acquire-and-exploit model. The company may find it difficult to complete accretive transactions in the future, which could negatively impact growth rate.Q4 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Cimarex Energy’s shares have returned 7.3% compared with the industry’s 9% rally.     Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

66,NFX,"On Jan 24, Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised higher from $2.10 to $2.15. Also, for 2018, estimates were raised from $2.44 to $2.82.Newfield has an impressive earnings surprise history. The upstream player managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 18.6%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 110.8% in 2017 and 31.4% in 2018.The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil is trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark, way higher than the historical low touched in February 2016. Also, natural gas crossed the mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.    The healthy commodity prices are especially favorable for Newfield as the company has a premium inventory of drilling wells in prospective oil and gas resources. In the liquid-rich Anadarko Basin, the upstream energy player has 350,000 net acres.Newfield has no current debt and its long-term debt has declined steeply since 2014.

68,NFX,"Upstream energy player Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 1, before the market opens.The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. Newfield beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 41.24%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Newfield Exploration Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Newfield Exploration Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newfield Exploration Company QuoteFactors Likely to Influence EarningsThough we remain positive on Newfield’s emerging resource play development program, we believe that a lower natural gas price environment as compared withmid-2014 level could weigh on the stock since most of its reserves are tied up in the commodity. Since oil and gas prices have been increasingly volatile in recent years, it tends to effect the sector’s stock performance.Additionally, Newfield’s high leverage and its Rockies and Gulf Coast-centered asset portfolio, along with its lack of meaningful exposure to the emerging shale plays, is a competitive disadvantage.However, horizontal drilling in Wasatch and high pressure Uteland Butte are likely tohelp the company enhance its shareholders’ value.Q2 Stock Price PerformancePricing chart for the first three months of this year reveals that Newfield’s shares have outperformed the industry. During the aforesaid period, the company’s shares have lost 8.3% compared with a 9.4% decrease for the broader industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Newfield will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

69,NFX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by a massive build in gasoline supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production maintained its steadily rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 2.9% (or $1.66) to end at $55.96 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Nov 16, while gasoline fell to its lowest in about seven weeks.Energy Stocks SlumpThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.3% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) were down 0.7%. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX  -  Free Report), Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) and Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.6 million barrels for the week ending Dec 1, following a decrease of 3.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 4.1 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand and lower imports led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 27 of the last 35 weeks and are down more than 85 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 448.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 7.8% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 2.8 million barrels to 55.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.2 days in the previous week to 26.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.8 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the fourth straight week as demand remained weak. The large, 6.8 million barrels addition – more than double the polled number of 2.7 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 220.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 3.7% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 1.7 million barrels last week, greater than analysts’ expectations for 1.5 million barrels increase in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to healthy production and lower demand. At 129.4 million barrels, current supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.2% from the prior week to 93.8%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

70,NFX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Newfield Exploration has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.8. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Newfield Exploration’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having fallen over the past few months. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.7 At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Newfield Exploration has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Newfield Exploration stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Newfield Exploration has a P/S ratio of about 3.6. This is a bit higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Nevertheless, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Even then, NFX is above its median value and hence in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Newfield Exploration currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Newfield Exploration a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Newfield Exploration is 1.2, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though Newfield Exploration might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives NFX a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher. The current quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen thirteen upward and only one downward revision in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 13.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 9.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Newfield Exploration Company Price and Consensus  Newfield Exploration Company Price and Consensus | Newfield Exploration Company QuoteEven though Newfield Exploration has a positive estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNewfield Exploration is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 34%) should boost investor confidence.However over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Newfield Exploration.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

71,NFX,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.8% (or $1.15) to $66.22 per barrel yesterday.The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks. In fact, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, the commodity continues to remain under pressure from reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela. As of now, all eyes are on the oil producers’ meeting set for Jun 22 in Vienna, which will decide what happens next regarding their supply curb policy.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 15, following a decrease of 4.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.7 million barrels.Record refinery throughput led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 43 of the last 63 weeks and are down more than 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 426.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 1.3 million barrels to 32.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up for the fourth time in five weeks as demand weakened. The 3.3 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.7 million barrels last week, again contrary to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 117.4 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and 14% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest in 2018.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

74,NFX,"Noble Energy, Inc.  (NBL  -  Free Report) announced that it has signed an agreement to divest approximately 30,200 net acres of company’s non-core DJ Basin portion to SRC Energy Inc, for a sum of $608 million.Details of the SaleThe acreage located in Weld County, CO, include Non-operated production of 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) and operated production of 1,600 Boe/d. Notably, the initial closing is anticipated to conclude by the end of 2017predicted toinclude mainly non-operated production acreage, followed by a second closing that is expected to conclude by mid-2018 and will include mainly producing properties.How will this Benefit Noble Energy?Noble Energy is currently making optimum use of its non-core properties and utilizing the proceeds to lower debt levels. Additionally, it is undertaking investments to further strengthen its core operation. The DJ Basin enjoys a distinct competitive advantage in terms of better infrastructure and long lateral drilling benefits. The competitive advantage that the rest of the liquids-rich area enjoys will help the company with strong production volumes for the rest of year.Looking AheadThe company has a diversified portfolio of short and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, in several locations. The company gained largely from the onshore sales that accounted for major sales volume during third-quarter 2017.Since a major portion of Noble Energy’s total production comes from its United States properties, the company is also investing substantially in these properties to further increase its total production.Noble Energy reiterated total sales volume in the range of 380-390 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day and U.S. onshore volumes are anticipated to be 15% higher than the third quarter levels.Looking ahead, robust production volumes from its organic and inorganic assets especially in DJ Basin volumes, along with its planned divestiture programs are anticipated to lower existing debt burden of the company going forward.Price MovementShares of Noble Energy have underperformed the industry in the last  twelve months. The company’s shares lost 22.8%, broader than the industry’s loss of 12.4%.A high burden of debt along with company's exposure to stringent regulations are causes of such underperformance.Zacks Rank & Peer PicksNoble Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors can consider other better-ranked stocks from the same industry that have released their third-quarter results.Bill Barrett Corporation , Continental Resources, Inc.

76,NFX,"Upstream energy player Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 31, after the closing bell.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate last quarter, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 2.3%. However, over the trailing four quarters, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.80 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $2.75 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $2.38 per Mcf. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production for the third quarter is 33.46 billion cubic feet (Bcf), up from 31.2 Bcf last quarter but down from 35.60 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the third quarter is estimated to be $23.52 per barrel, lower than the reported price of last quarter’s $24.54 per barrel but higher than $18.53 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Production is expected to rise to 2.82 million barrels (MMBbls) from second-quarter production of 2.49 MMBbls but fall from the year-ago quarter’s production of 2.90 MMBbls.Average crude oil and condensate sales price is expected to be $44.16 per barrel, lower than second quarter’s $46.81 per barrel and the year-ago quarter’s price of $46.34 per barrel. Production of crude oil per day for the third quarter is expected to fall to 5.84 MMBbls from previous quarter’s 5.96 MMBbls and the year-ago quarter’s 6.40 MMBbls.We expect production of all commodities to decline in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Some of the average realized prices are expected to increase. Hence, it is difficult to conclusively predict their net impact on third-quarter results.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newfield is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, -0.84%.  This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 42 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 43 cents.Zacks Rank: Newfield’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Q3 Stock Price PerformanceNewfield has gained 4.2% in the third quarter compared with 5.1% growth of its industry.Stocks to Consider                                                                                        Here are some companies that you may consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) is an exploration and production company based in Plano, TX. It has an Earnings ESP of +100.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

77,NFX,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.Near about half of the S&P listed energy companies have released their first-quarter results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes, Hess Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation, Range Resources Corporation, Phillips 66, National Oilwell Varco, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Cabot oil & Gas Corporation, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips.Two biggies — ExxonMobil and Chevron — reported their results on Apr 27. While Chevron delivered earnings beat on higher oil prices and volumes, ExxonMobil missed estimates amid output and refinery throughput decline, along with lower margins at chemicals business.Bullish Results & ExpectationsIn the last reported quarter, earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 70.8% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.4% from the year-ago levels.Q1 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil: The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.It goes without saying that all oil-producing companies are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products. However, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners, leading to higher input cost for them.Natural gas: However, price of natural gas dropped about 7.4% in the January-March period. Along with the sequential fall, natural gas prices also remained unfavorable compared with the corresponding period of 2017. Commodity futures were $2.73 per MMBtu at the end of the quarter, down more than 14% from the Mar 31, 2017 settlement of $3.19 per MMBtu.Energy Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 1Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 1.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player focused mainly on the lucrative Permian Basin. The company is expected to release results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the last reported quarter, Concho delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.It looks like Concho is all set to keep its earnings streak alive in the first quarter, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.86% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter. Moreover, analysts also envision higher price realizations that will further buoy its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% and 11.3% from the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Next up, we have Oklahoma-based independent energy producer Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), which is slated to release numbers after the closing bell.  In the fourth quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 36.67% amid higher impairment charges. Nonetheless, the company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters.However, our proven model does not show that Devon Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Weather-related issues are expected to affect first-quarter production of the firm. The company estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 530,000-554,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, compared with 548,000 Boe achieved in fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $3,852 million for the first quarter, exhibiting a sequential decline of 3.33%.Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), — an oil and gas producer with operations focused in the Gulf of Mexico — is set to unveil results after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter, with the positive earnings surprise being 18.3%. Moreover, it has topped earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.9%.However, our proven model does not show conclusively that the company will be able to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter, as it carries an Earnings ESP of -0.76% and Zacks Rank #3.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), implying a year-over-year decline from $2.93 per Mcf, the estimate for gas production is pegged at 35.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), reflecting an improvement from 29.4 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.Next in line we have Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell. The independent oil and gas producer mainly operates in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent and Gulf of Mexico regions.In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 700%. The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 246.16%.However, our model indicates that Noble Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter’s total sales volume stands at 361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), indicating a decline on both yearly and sequential basis. However, estimates for first-quarter total revenues increased 21.54% to $1.2 billion from the same period last year.Lastly, we have independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell.  In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.However, this time around, our model does not predict earnings beat for the stock, as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While Marathon Petroleum’s retail and midstream segment bodes well, a more conservative refining outlook is likely to affect the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

79,NFX,"Although Wall Street had the best start to 2018 in more than three decades, things turned bitter to end the first quarter, with many sectors and stocks entering correction territory from their latest peak. With a day’s trading left, the S&P 500 is down 2.6% and on track for the worst quarter in two and a half years.A combination of factors like concerns over faster-than-expected rates hike, trade tensions, and the health of the technology sector pushed the Wall Street from deep green to red.Rate Hike FearsThe first round of brutal trading came in early February following the better-than-expected wage growth, sending major indices into correction territory. At the lower levels, the S&P 500 shed about $2.5 trillion in its value from Jan 26. Then, the Fed minutes and the new Fed chairperson Jerome Powell took away some sheen from the riskier assets.Trump TariffAgain in early March, Trump’s tariff news spooked markets, sparking threats of a trade war. President Trump imposed severe tariffs of 24% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports that could lead to retaliation from other countries thereby resulting in unforeseen consequences. Although this fear faded with Trump and other countries starting negotiations, the President’s intention to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeting the technology and telecommunications sectors, led to bloodbath in the stock markets yet again.Tech RoutThen the panic was created by the social media giant Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) following the data breach report, which sparked concerns about data privacy and security, resulting in increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure. The news has taken a toll not only the broader technology sector but the broad U.S. market as well. This was followed by a slew of negative news that again has sent the sector into a tailspin this week, with FANG stocks being the biggest losers.In particular, the most recent tech rout has washed away about $2.34 trillion from the market cap of the S&P 500 since its peak in late January. This means that almost one-third of the Trump rally was erased during the current market pullback.The stock market had added $6.9 trillion in market cap at the peak since Trump was elected. The FAAMG stocks — Facebook, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — were the largest contributors. Though these stocks do not shed larger in terms of percentage, the pullback in Facebook and Alphabet took out a combined $230 billion of market cap from the S&P 500 in the last two months. Both stocks were down 13.3% and 4.6%, respectively.That said, a number of stocks have crushed, piling up heavy losses during this time frame. Below, we have highlighted five such stocks from the S&P 500 index that have been hit badly in the market turmoil and might continue their rough trading in the months ahead if similar trends persist.Patterson Companies Inc.

83,NFX,"Reflecting the resumption of activities post hurricane Harvey, the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another large build, while product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply. In fact, market players welcomed the faster-than-normal return to normalized operations in South Texas region following the storm’s landfall nearly a month ago.The commodity was also supported by tensions in the Middle East over President Donald Trump's comments on Iran's nuclear deal and talks of an extension to the output cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers beyond March next year.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.9% (or 93 cents) to settle at $50.41 per barrel Thursday – the highest level since May 24.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish data sets encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.7% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 15, following an increase of 5.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.4 million barrels.Volume ramp-up from the import and production facilities shuttered in the wake of hurricane Harvey led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.Despite the substantial climb in oil storage for a third straight week, current supplies – at 472.8 million barrels – are still marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 703,000 barrels to 59.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 29.4 days in the previous week to 30.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the third week running as Gulf Coast refineries sidelined by Harvey continue to ramp up throughput. The 2.1 million barrels draw – above the polled number of 800,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 216.2 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 5.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for one million barrels decrease in supply level. The largest weekly fall since 2011 could be again be attributed to recovering refinery post storm-induced outages. At 138.9 million barrels, current supplies are 15.8% below the year-ago level but are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.5% from the prior week to 83.2%. While refinery runs rebounded from the previous week’s nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005. With more units returning to activity over the coming weeks, we expect utilization and throughput to continue to rise.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Lonestar Resources US Inc.

88,NFX,"In a low oil price environment, oil companies looking for options to reduce the cost of production and cope up with oil price volatility. For this reason, many of the U.S. oil companies have left the Canadian oil sands and moved to the Permian Basin where production cost is lower.Apart from the Permian Basin, there are five other major oil producing regions in the United States, which are covered by EIA in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. These include Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.However there is growing interest in another shale play located to the north of Permian Basin. It has witnessed a brisk increase in investment and drilling activity recently, which has prompted the EIA to include the region in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. The growing presence of shale players in the Anadarko region may have led to its inclusion. The region incorporates 24 Oklahoma and five Texas counties.Production Related DetailsIn terms of production, the Anadarko region generated 447,000 barrels of oil and 5,979 million cubic feet of gas per day in August 2017. Moreover, the region is becoming popular due to surging natural gas production and the trend is expected to continue in the coming month.The month over month data shows that the region is likely to register an increase in oil and gas production, for September 2017, by 12,000 barrels and 78 million cubic feet per day, respectively.Why the Shift?The interest in Anadarko region – incorporates one of the most prolific natural gas reserves in North America – can be attributed to the rising opportunity of using upgraded drilling and completion technology.Another factor that is increasing the focus on Anadarko is rising lease operating expenses in the Permian Basin. There is also a shortage of oilfield services and occasional production hiccups from time to time in the Permian Basin. Investors should know that 129 rigs, as of July, were actively engaged in drilling activities in Anadarko basin, which were less than 373 active rigs in the crowded Permian Basin.The Anadarko region includes the STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) and the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) plays. These two areas have witnessed an increase in investment from exploration and production companies in the recent years.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), SandRidge Energy, Inc. , Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) are among the oil companies operating in the basin.

93,NFX,"We are in the thick of the Q2 earnings season, with results from 286 S&P 500 companies that account for almost 68.8% of the index’s total membership. According to the latest Earnings Trend, overall earnings for these companies are up 11.3% from the year-ago comparable period on 6.1% higher revenues. While 74.5% companies delivered positive earnings surprises, 69.2% beat revenue estimates.The overall financial performance so far this earnings cycle reflects optimism. True to predictions, the sector has witnessed positive growth. The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second quarter of 2016, wherein energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249%, the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors, the top line is likely to display a growth of 16.5% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 1Let’s see what’s in store for these three energy companies that are expected to report Q2 results on Aug 1.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), one of the leading upstream energy players, is expected to report financial results, after market closes.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of 15 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a loss of 83 cents.Our model does not indicate that EOG Resources is likely to beat on earnings. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat on earnings.EOG Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP complicates our surprise prediction. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. EOG Resources, Inc.

This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 16/77% in the third quarter.We expect agency revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter driven by strength across priceline.com and booking.com. While priceline.com is expected to benefit from room night growth, booking.com is likely to ride on vacation rental properties growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for agency revenues is pegged at $2 billion. In the third quarter, agency revenues had increased 51.1% sequentially and 21.8% year over year.Agoda and Rental Cars to Boost Merchant Revenues In the to-be-reported-quarter, merchant revenues are also expected to grow driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com.

In the third quarter, merchant revenues were up 37.4% sequentially and 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.ConcernsWeaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.Also, for the fourth quarter of 2017, Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 8-13% and total gross bookings to increase 9.5-14.5% year over year (5.5-10.5% on a constant currency basis).
