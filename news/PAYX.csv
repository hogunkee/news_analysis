Stocks including Five Below (FIVE) and Kemet (KEM) were set to open on Wednesday either in buy range or below buy points.

Among those, kid-friendly dollar store Five Below ended Tuesday's session less than 3% below a 104.09 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The IBD Leaderboard name scored a 22% breakaway gap on June 7, after crushing first-quarter expectations. Shares consolidated just below their June 13 high, completing a three-weeks-tight pattern on Friday. The June 7 breakout was from a third-stage base.

Both remained extended after breakouts.HealthEquity was 5% above its 50-day moving average. Mastercard was 3% above its line.

13,PAYX,"Bill Ackman is done with Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), still shorting Herbalife (HLF) and tweeting about Chipotle (CMG). Now the billionaire hedge funder is turning his blue-eyed gaze toward payroll firm Automatic Data Processing (ADP).XAckman's Pershing Square Capital is seeking control of five of ADP's 10 board seats, said ADP in a Friday statement.ADP said Pershing first reached out on Tuesday, and Ackman — who beneficially owns 8% of the payroll processor — asked the company to extend its Aug. 10 board nomination deadline by 30 to 45 days to nominate five directors, including himself, to ADP's board. Ackman also told ADP that CEO Carlos Rodriguez ""should be replaced.""But ADP is pushing back, touting its total shareholder return of 202% since Rodriguez took the helm and contrasting it to Pershing's return of 29%.""ADP is open to constructive input from our shareholders, and our Board respects the right of shareholders to nominate directors,"" said the company. ""However, ADP has a clearly defined Board nomination process, and the 2017 deadline for director nominations has been public for nearly a year. The Board has unanimously determined that it is not in the best interests of ADP or its other shareholders to accede to Pershing Square's last-minute request for an extension.""The current board has ""an effective balance of leadership continuity and fresh perspectives"" that will help ADP to further its goals, said the statement.ADP shares rose about 2% initially but closed down 0.3% to 111.39 in the stock market today. Peers Paycom Software (PAYC), Paychex (PAYX) and Paylocity (PCTY) did react much.Ackman's quests are well known. He took his bet on drugmaker Valeant all the way to the bottom, more or less, holding on to Pershing Square's stake until March of this year, despite a 2015 price-spiking scandal that drove off other hedge funds. Pershing Square was reportedly offered 11.10 to 11.40 each for shares that, at their late 2015 high, traded at 263.81.He also has a billion-dollar bet against multilevel marketing firm Herbalife, alleging that the nutrition supplement seller is a pyramid scheme. The Federal Trade Commission leveled a complaint against Herbalife last July that resulted in the company agreeing to fully restructure its U.S. business and pay consumers $200 million over charges that Herbalife deceived people into believing they could get rich quick by becoming distributors of its products.The ensuing FTC regulations have weighed on Herbalife, but shares are up over 35% so far this calendar year.A few weeks ago, Ackman joined Twitter.

26,PAYX,"Paycom Software (PAYC) is a rare bird these days — a fast-growing vendor of cloud-based applications that's also quite profitable.In this case, Oklahoma City-based Paycom has managed to make its mark providing payroll processing and human capital management software in an integrated offering to U.S. companies.Paycom stock has been a big winner this year, with shares up 30% so far in 2016. Its stock ended trading Thursday down fractionally to 48.75. It went public at 15 in April 2014.""The company has consistently outperformed expectations, is expected to grow well over 40% in 2016, and is nicely profitable — a rare combination in the cloud software space,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes said in a recent note to clients. He rates Paycom stock as a buy with a price target of 55.Paycom focuses mostly on small and midsize companies with 50 to 2,000 workers for its software-as-a-service. That keeps it under the radar of larger firms such as payroll-processing leader ADP (ADP) and cloud-based human resources software provider Workday (WDAY).Still, ADP is considered to be among its main rivals, along with Paychex (PAYX), Paylocity (PCTY) and Ultimate Software (ULTI), RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a note to clients. He rates Paycom stock as sector perform with a price target of 54.While most providers of payroll and HR software tick off all the necessary boxes for functionality, Paycom excels in several ways, MacMillan said.For starters, its software is based off a core system of records maintained in a single database. Since the Paycom software is essentially a single application, it is easier for administrators to manage, MacMillan points out.""We believe our success is due to the growing recognition of the benefits that can be gained from Paycom's single database architecture,"" Paycom Chief Executive Chad Richison said on a conference call with analysts on Aug. 2.Paycom's software also is sold directly to customers through agents in regional sales offices.""Paycom has a very clear playbook for driving growth by adding customers and by increasing the average recurring revenue per customer,"" MacMillan's report says.Its customer growth strategy is based on expanding its sales organization through new regional offices across the U.S. Paycom has 42 sales offices now with line of sight to about 124 possible offices, MacMillan said.""We are still in the early stages of a multiyear mission to gain market share and grow into one of the largest providers of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software,"" Richison said.MacMillan believes Paycom can grow its sales by 25% or more for the next three years by adding new customers and increasing revenue per customer.HR management today is all about regulatory compliance and benefits, so Paycom and the industry benefit when the government imposes new employee rules on companies.For instance, Paycom has gotten a boost from selling software to help companies comply with the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare.The company also recently released a tool kit to comply with changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, allowing customers to make strategic decisions related to new overtime pay regulations.IBD'S TAKE: Paycom stock sports a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group. Paycom also is on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.Another area for compliance involves meeting diversity requirements.Paycom says it helps companies effectively navigate a rapidly changing business environment. Its software is designed to manage employees from recruitment through retirement.The market for cloud and outsourced payroll processing and related human capital management services is worth about $25 billion to $30 billion a year in the U.S. and is growing in the high single digits, MacMillan said.""We think Paycom can address up to $14 billion of the payroll/HCM market,"" MacMillan said. ""Paycom's calendar 2016 revenue forecast of $326 million suggests the company has single digit share.Paycom likely gets about half its new customers by winning business away from ADP and, to a lesser extent, Paychex, he said. The rest it pulls from small regional players running payroll-centric licensing software and from in-house and on-premises services like Microsoft (MSFT) Dynamics GP and Sage.Paycom is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market close on Nov. 1.In the second quarter, Paycom reported earnings per share of 21 cents excluding items, up 110% year over year, on sales of $73.9 million, up 51%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 13 cents EPS minus items on sales of $70.6 million.For the September quarter, analysts are looking for Paycom to earn 11 cents a share excluding items, up 38%, on sales of $76.7 million, up 39%.Paycom is starting to face difficult comparisons to big year-ago quarters, so its growth rate is likely to decelerate, MacMillan said.There's a lot to like about Paycom, MacMillan said. He just thinks the stock is fairly valued at current levels.Shares have been in a base of late, but neared a breakout point in Monday trades, climbing nearly 5% to close at 52.44.RELATED:How Big Will The 2016, 2017 Earnings Increases Be For Major Stock Leaders?

Other leaders are Fleetmatics Group (FLTX), Ultimate Software, Blackbaud (BLKB) and Manhattan Associates (MANH).Paycom Software is a pretty small fish in a pretty big pond of payroll and human resources software, competing against much larger players like Automated Data Processing (ADP), Ceridian and Paychex.Even so, Paycom (PAYC) doesn't have much problem delivering robust financial returns or taking share away from the big boys.This hasn't gone unnoticed by investors, who pushed Paycom's stock price to new highs this week.The company offers cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software delivered as Software as a Service.Its gear provides functionality and data analytics that businesses can use to manage the complete employment life cycle, from recruitment to retirement. It also offers tools to help clients manage ObamaCare plans. Most of its business comes from small and midsize firms.Apps And CompetitorsPaycom's HCM software features a suite of applications that range from employment applicant tracking and background checks to time and labor management, payroll and tax management, performance management and employee learning and training.There's plenty of competition in this field. Besides big players like ADP (ADP), Paychex (PAYX) and privately held Ceridian, other companies that offer HCM tools include smaller (for now) outfits such as Ultimate Software Group (ULTI), Workday (WDAY), Cornerstone On Demand (CSOD) and Paylocity Holding (PCTY).Even software companies that don't specialize in payroll or HR are moving into the HCM space.""Salesforce.com (CRM) is continuing to build out its product offering, and SAP (SAP) has exposure to the human capital management side of things,"" Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom told IBD. (Salesforce is scheduled to disclose its second-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.)With only $151 million in sales last year, Paycom is dwarfed by multi-billion-dollar companies such as ADP. But it's still carving out market share thanks to the strength of its technology, analysts say.""Paycom is chipping away at the fringe of the traditional payroll processing market,"" Wahlstrom said. ""Certainly the Software-as-a-Service model is something that a lot of newer companies are looking for. A lot of new customers are spending incrementally with Paycom that would not be spending with ADP or Ceridian because a lot of the functionality does not exist on those platforms.""On a Q2 conference call with analysts earlier this month, Paycom CEO Chad Richison said his company is ""relentlessly focused on software development.""In addition to rolling out new applications, he said, Paycom also continues ""to deepen the functionality within each of our existing offerings. As a result, we once again more than doubled our research and development expenditures"" during the second quarter by growing them 103% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis.It's hard to argue with Paycom's results. It went public just last year, but has a yearslong streak of 33%-or-better revenue growth.Sales And Profit Take OffAfter the close on Aug. 4, Paycom reported Q2 revenue of $49 million, up 47% from the prior year and above consensus analyst estimates for $45.8 million.Recurring revenue climbed 46% and made up 97.6% of the total. Annualized new recurring revenue gained 43% to $16.5 million. The company also raised its full-year sales outlook.Second-quarter earnings more than tripled from a year earlier to 10 cents a share — topping views by 4 cents — while adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $13.1 million. GAAP net income hit $5.9 million vs. $593,000 lost a year earlier.The day after reporting earnings, Paycom's stock price shot up 18% to 37.85. Shares set a record high of 41.36 this past Monday.The company's Q2 results were helped by a rising volume of larger deals, JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted in a report.""Management also highlighted good initial traction for two new products released in the quarter and reported encouraging deal wins with its Learning module, which was launched last quarter,"" Murphy said. ""The continued strong results solidify our belief that Paycom is in a position to capture market share and increase long-term shareholder value.""The market share gains will be partly driven by the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, which has added another layer of complexity to health benefits processing. Paycom's cloud-based products help clients manage changes under the ACA.Navigating ObamaCareIn December, the company rolled out a new dashboard for its ACA software that lets customers more easily navigate. During the second quarter it added an enhanced ACA compliance offering with greater functionality for clients, CEO Richison said on the conference call.Based on feedback from monthly ACA webinars, he said, businesses ""are more concerned than ever by the employer mandate reporting requirements. With this in mind, we set out to aid eight businesses in their pursuit to better monitor, report and evaluate the organizational needs in order to comply with this significant piece of health-care reform.""Paycom is an IBD 50 stock with a 98 Composite Rating. It's the highest rated issue in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 46 out of 197 industries tracked. Other leaders are Fleetmatics Group (FLTX), Ultimate Software, Blackbaud (BLKB) and Manhattan Associates (MANH).

That's put Paycom on a fast growth path as its cloud-based products help companies manage the changes under the health law.""Our technology and strong sales model propelled our ability to add to our growing client base,"" Paycom founder and CEO Chad Richardson said in a statement.Analysts see Paycom taking market share away from incumbents like Automatic Data Processing (ADP), privately held Ceridian, Paychex (PAYX) and Intuit (INTU). In the broader HCM space, Paycom is also seen challenging Workday (WDAY) as well as Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD).Paycom has a strong 97 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 97% of all stocks in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

109,PAYX,"Highly rated but modestly traded Genpact (G) stock bumped up a fraction Friday, after a day of show-and-tell at its analyst day Thursday that spotlighted a surge of growth for the outsourcing business. Many rival stocks were up even more, with Paychex (PAYX) stock up 2% in midday trading in the stock market today.William Blair analyst Anil Doradla came away ""with the sense that business fundamentals were intact and that the company's deal pipeline is healthy,"" he wrote in a research note Friday.Genpact executives suggested that the company had plenty of room for growth in its business process outsourcing market, because revenue for the market overall rose 35%, to $500 billion, in the past year, while Genpact sales rose 8%, to $2.46 billion, Doradla said. But he also said BPO growth will slow.Doradla put Genpact trading at 18.8 times William Blair's 2016 EPS estimate for Genpact, ""a slight premium to its peers in the fast-growth BPO industry,"" which is trading at 17.6 times estimated earnings, he said.BPO is found in more than one industry group.

IBM (IBM) is included in this group, although it does much more than outsourcing.Infosys stock was up a fraction midday Friday, while Cognizant was more than 2% and IBM nearly 2%.Genpact specializes in financial services outsourcing, contributing about 42% of its revenue. Manufacturing and health care are its other two main markets.Sales to its largest customer, General Electric (GE), fell 1% last year to 19% of Genpact's total revenue. Genpact is a GE spinoff.""Overall, we came away with a bullish tone from management, both at a company-specific level and with regard to the overall BPO market,"" Doradla said. ""Management highlighted that the company is witnessing healthy demand in its business and that Genpact has an active deal pipeline.""Some of the key drivers for the upwardly revised figures include customers increasingly viewing BPO companies as transformation partners who not only offer a cost arbitrage, but also provide valuable insights into business operations. Specific areas in which the industry is increasingly engaging clients include IoT, big data and cybersecurity.""Bottom line, we believe that the BPO industry is poised for strong overall growth over the next several years and that Genpact stands to grow at a faster pace than the overall industry due to domain expertise and strong client relationships.""Genpact carries an IBD Composite Rating of 96, with 99 the highest, and currently is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Trading near 26.50 midday Friday, it is within range from a 26 buy point touched last month.

Most IBD 50 stocks trended lower, with Store Capital (STOR) and Smith & Wesson Holdings (SWHC) falling around 2%.Store Capital dropped after pricing a 33.3 million-share offering (of shares held by Store Holding Co., a stockholder affiliated with Oaktree Capital Management) at 25.25, almost 3% below Tuesday's closing price.

111,PAYX,"Just because you're looking at a nice base structure, doesn't mean you can't look at getting a nice dividend too.Paychex (PAYX) has been forming a shallow cup base for the last three months. The weekly chart shows some volume spikes on the downside and lower volume on the right-hand side of its base. However, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B and the up/down volume has improved to 1.0 in the last few weeks. The stock only gave up 16% and held fairly tight at its lows, refusing to give up more ground.The company gets the bulk of its revenue from providing payroll services to small- and medium-sized businesses. With fewer employees, smaller businesses often find it more cost-effective to outsource their payroll and other human resource functions. Paychex has a steady three-year annual earnings growth rate of 8% with an Earnings Stability Factor of 1, where the lower number reflects less volatility in earnings. They have an excellent Composite Rating of 96 with stellar return-on-equity of 38%, no debt, and a dividend yield of 3.2%.Lockheed Martin (LMT) is forming a base that is even more shallow with a depth of 12%, qualifying it as a flat base. Two glaring negatives: the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a D and the up/down volume is at 0.7. The defense company gets 78% of its revenue from the U.S. government, and could benefit from a budget compromise in October that increased the Pentagon's budget over the next two years.The dividend yield for Lockheed Martin is 3.0% and the dividend growth rate is 19%, a big plus for income investors. The company has reported steady growth in earnings with a three-year annual growth rate of 11% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 3.Target (TGT) just reported earnings this week and rose despite missing estimates. That puts the stock firmly on the right-hand side of a 35-week consolidation. The retail giant saw a big move in its Accumulation/Distribution Rating going from a D- last week to a B this week, largely due to big volume on a 4% gain Wednesday. The dividend yield is 2.8% and the dividend growth rate is 26%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

113,PAYX,"Wall Street will be eyeing Friday's jobs report closely. So will Paychex (PAYX), an IBD Dividend Leader and a direct beneficiary of an improving labor market.With a market capitalization just north of $10 billion, Paychex provides payroll, human resources, insurance and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-size businesses. It's a dominant player in the industry, along with its main competitor, Automatic Data Processing (ADP).When it comes to earnings and dividend stability, it's hard to do much better than Paychex. In January, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, payable on Feb. 17 to shareholders of record Feb. 2. An annualized dividend of $1.52 gives it a yield of around 3.2%.In December, Paychex reported fiscal second-quarter profit of 47 cents a share, up 9% from a year ago. Sales growth accelerated from the prior quarter, rising 10% to $676.3 million. Payroll service sales rose 4% to $411.2 million. Human resources services sales jumped 21% to $254.7 million.In the second quarter, the company unveiled Paychex Flex, which integrates a software-as-a-service platform with the company's newly expanded service offerings.Meanwhile, a new product related to health care reform is doing well. It offers clients assistance in understanding the Affordable Care Act and its impact on business.At the end of the second quarter, Paychex's cash and total corporate investments totaled $927.5 million. The company is debt-free.Despite steady price performance in recent months, Paychex has its share of detractors. Short interest has stayed relatively high in the stock for several months, perhaps because of fears that the job market isn't as strong as recent data indicate. In mid-January, short interest totaled 14.7 million shares, according to Nasdaq.com.Paychex is a good example of how a stock can trend higher despite high short interest.

125,PAYX,"In December, Paycom launched a new ""dashboard"" to its existing compliance solution on the Affordable Care Act to navigate the new employer mandate that went into effect in January. Earlier this year Paycom rolled out a new ""learning management"" system.

"
139,PAYX,"Pricing is based on the number of customers' employees and the number of apps utilized. Davis figures that Paycom would get $20 per month per employee if all its apps were utilized, up from a starting point of around $10 or less per month. However, that could take some time.

140,PAYX,"""Right now it's a race to see who can get the customers,"" he said. ""It's like an open field and everyone is trying to get as many customers as they can. Once you land them they are sticky because it's a pain to switch.""

Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment.

The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year.

Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%.

186,PAYX,"The second annual IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards came down decidedly in favor of small-cap funds over their mid- and large-cap peers, as small caps overcame a roller-coaster stock market in 2016 to produce outsize gains.Winning an IBD Best Mutual Fund Award is not easy. Funds must have at least $100 million in assets and must beat a benchmark — in this case the S&P 500 — in the past one, three, five and 10 years.When you look at U.S. equity mutual funds organized by market capitalization — large, mid- and small cap — 1,200 are big enough and old enough. But only 49 emerged as winners by beating the S&P 500 over all four periods.Nearly half of those — 23 — were small-cap funds. Why so many?Part of the explanation is that they won the numbers game. They outperformed big-time in 2016 and in four earlier years of the decade, says Christopher Lo, a manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Small Cap Index (NMSCX), the ninth-best-performing portfolio on the Best Mutual Fund Awards winners small-cap list. Those five years of outperformance more than made up for years when they stood out less, he adds.Another reason small-cap funds predominate among cap-size outperformers is that in 2016 alone, they benefited more than other cap-size groups from the election results. ""Small caps tend to have higher shares of domestic revenues,"" Lo said. ""So they benefited from the prospect of policy changes, such as lowering corporate taxes — small caps tend to pay higher tax rates — and increasing infrastructure spending.""A third reason: Small caps tend to outperform in periods of rising interest rates. When rates rise because the economy is strengthening, that often coincides with strengthening fundamentals for U.S. small caps, Lo said.In addition, coming out of economic downturns — such as in 2010 — small caps tend to outperform because they are less burdened by balance-sheet debt. They borrow less than large caps do during downturns, Lo said.A fifth reason for small-cap excellence is the prevalence of small-cap innovators.The 108 Best Mutual Fund Award winners last year have dwindled to 49 the latest year. Why the big drop-off? The stock market in 2016 was a pivotal factor, as the Brexit and elections caught many fund managers on the wrong side of the broad market benchmark. The number of large-cap winners fell to 11 from 94, midcap winners edged up to 15 from 10 and small-cap winners rose to 23 from 4.Return winners among the three cap-size categories also got mowed down by a volatile market in 2016. Large-cap funds did best, with three of their 11 winners this year repeating from 2015. Just one midcap winner was a repeat performer. And not a single small-cap portfolio was a veteran award winner.So how can you use our lists of award winners to build a better portfolio? When you're building or reviewing a portfolio, your investment profile is likely to call for various weightings in large-, mid, and small-cap funds. Consider filling those portfolio slots with IBD Best Mutual Fund Award winners. If the winners aren't available in your 401(k) plan, you can ask your plan provider why not.What made these funds winners? For one thing, to become a winner it helps if a fund can minimize its losses in market downturns. Otherwise, its long-term returns suffer, potentially knocking it out of contention over the longer time periods.""It takes discipline,"" said Mark Oelschlager, manager of $213 million Pin Oak Equity Fund (POGSX), a top-five standout in the U.S. diversified equity, blend (where it is No. 1) and large-cap categories. He also runs $420 million Red Oak Technology (ROGSX), tops among sector funds. ""It takes a willingness to go against the crowd. And it takes conviction.""Oelschlager showed those traits in recent years when he bet big on financials as they sold off in the financial crisis. ""We had confidence that eventually conditions would change and we would be rewarded,"" he said. He has already started to take profits in the sector, trimming his weighting, he says.Independent thinking is another trait that fuels outperformance, Oelschlager says. His reaction to the market's postelection advance is a case study. While many other investors are seeking pure plays on the widely expected boost in infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts, Oelschlager is looking elsewhere. ""We've been looking in the opposite direction from the Trump bump,"" he said. ""We're moving incrementally toward stability. We still have significant exposure to financials and some other cyclical sectors, but we're generally favoring stability in consumer staples, health care, even in technology and financials.""Bank of New York Mellon (BK) is a financial he still likes. ""Its valuation is still attractive,"" he said. ""It's relatively stable. It doesn't have the same issues with lending cycles as many other banks because it's not focused on lending. It's more of a trust bank.""Paychex (PAYX) and Amdocs (DOX) are two more examples. Paychex provides payroll and other employee-benefits services for customers. Amdocs is a leader in back-end software systems for telecom enterprises. ""Both are relatively stable companies in what are considered cyclical sectors,"" Oelschlager said.Valero Energy (VLO) refines and markets fuels and other petroleum products. ""Energy is considered a cyclical, and energy is expected to benefit from Trump,"" Oelschlager said. ""But Valero has less leverage to this cycle. They are further downstream. They are not an E&P. They don't have the same volatility. And their results are more consistent than an E&P company's.""Oelschlager isn't the only advocate of discipline. Jerry Dodson, manager of $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), shows another way that discipline contributes to outperformance. Dodson buys stocks only once they have tumbled 33% below what he determines their intrinsic value to be.He must also satisfy himself that the stock's setback is just temporary and not a sign of something that has crippled the company. In addition, he wants bargains that can rebound within three years.""Part of the beauty of this process is that all we need is for the stock to rebound to its fair market value,"" Dodson said. ""We're not asking it to do anything extraordinary.""Dodson is a returning winner for good reason. Parnassus Endeavor posted a 12.23% average annual return over the 10 years ended Dec. 31. That was tops among all U.S. equity funds. It was also No. 1 in both the growth and large-cap categories. Its pace was nearly double the S&P 500's 6.95% yearly average return.There's no single path to consistent outperformance. Dodson achieved that goal with just 25 large-cap holdings as of Dec. 31. William Coleman and Gerry O'Reilly, managers of $5.2 billion Vanguard Tax-Managed Small Cap (VTMSX), reached the brass ring with 597 small stocks as of Jan. 31.The Vanguard fund ranks in the top five in both the small-cap and blend categories.Coleman and O'Reilly's strategy hinges on dumping holdings that are losing ground. They do it to minimize tax losses. But the strategy has the added benefit of constantly pumping up their weighting in their best performers. ""Some of our outperformance comes from selling names before they head farther south,"" O'Reilly said. ""We take those proceeds and spread them over winning names in our benchmark, which boosts our performance.""It's a strategy that wins by hitting singles, not home runs. The portfolio holds nearly 600 names, and just one had a weighting higher than 0.58% as of Dec. 31.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), with a weighting of about a quarter of 1%, gapped up 43% on March 20, and is now up 91% so far this year. The biotech jumped on the release of data from its main clinical trial, which involves a search a practical alternative to addictive opioid therapies for managing pain. Opioid abuse is an epidemic. The company has yet to notch an annual profit, going back to 2008.Nutrisystem (NTRI), which markets weight-loss products and services, is up 57% this year. Shares gapped up 19% on Feb. 28, the day after the company reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company reported 29-cent Q4 earnings per share, a 53% gain vs. 20% in Q3, topping analysts' estimates. It also offered bullish guidance for 2017.Lumentum Holdings (LITE), a fiber optics provider, is up 40% this year. The stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group. It has a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD — 99 is the highest rating. And it has four years in a row of annual EPS growth.IBD'S TAKE: See how Lumentum's easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.There are many paths to consistent outperformance. One fund's winning way may be fine for some shareholders but too volatile or too risky for others, says Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX), the No. 1 winner in the value funds category and a top-five winner in the midcap group.RELATED:Introducing IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards

187,PAYX,"Scores of leading stocks jumped to new highs Wednesday, after President Trump's speech to Congress on Tuesday evening and amid expectations for a Fed rate hike this month. Banks were some of the biggest gainers as they tend to benefit from higher interest rates. Citigroup (C) gapped up and rose 1.74, or 3%, to 61.54, climbing past a 61.73 buy…
"
188,PAYX,"Human resources software firm Workday (WDAY), business software giant Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) have poked above buy points in recent days, joining Paycom (PAYC). Meanwhile, Big Data specialist Splunk (SPLK) tried to break out Wednesday but is likely to close below a proper entry area.Here's a look at these five software stocks, going over their positives and negatives.Workday shares fell 0.5% to 88.22 in Wednesday stock market trading, briefly dipping below a 88.10 buy point intraday. On Friday, shares popped 3.5% to 88.49 in a four-month consolidation. Workday has run up sharply in 2017, but its relative strength line (the blue line in the chart below) remains weak.Piper Jaffray upgraded the provider of cloud-based human-resources applications to overweight on Friday, raising its price target for Workday to 100 from 78. Analyst Alex Zukin said his ""channel checks"" for Workday showed business momentum is ""the strongest in recent memory.""IBD'S TAKE: Investor's Business Daily boasts the IBD 50 of leading growth stocks, IPO Leaders, IBD Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders and Stock Spotlight — and you can go here to find all those growth stock lists and related articles.Workday boasts many large-scale customers, grabbing Wal-Mart (WMT) as a client, beating out software giant SAP. Workday also competes with Oracle in its HR niche.Revenue growth has trended down over the last several years, but was still up 34% to $409.6 million in the fiscal third quarter.Meanwhile, Workday is close to turning the corner on earnings. After consistent losses, Workday began alternating a quarter of slim adjusted earnings per share with a quarter of narrow losses.On Feb. 27, Workday reports earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. Wall Streets expects a 1-cent loss. But that would cap Workday's first annual profit, with analysts predicting only profits going forward, with strong growth for next several quarters.Of course, that's if all goes according to plan or better. Workday plunged 12% on Dec. 2, following its fiscal Q3 report, on weaker-than-expected billings and revenue guidance.RELATED:Oracle edged up 0.6% to 42.51, a day after just crossing a 42.10 buy point. Oracle is trading at its best levels since June 2015.Oracle stock has risen nearly 11% so far in 2017. But the stock's RS line remains in a downtrend going back 11 months.Oracle is belatedly shifting from its license-based model to a cloud-based subscription path. But while its cloud business is growing briskly, Oracle is struggling for overall earnings and sales gains.RELATED:The German business software giant advanced 0.9% to 94.01, hitting a fresh all-time high. Shares retook a 92.74 buy point on Tuesday after moving above and below the entry point in recent days in sluggish trading as it tries to clear a consolidation going back nearly five months.SAP's RS line remains off its highs like Workday's, but the trend isn't as weak as Oracle's.SAP's has had uneven earnings in recent quarters, though sales growth has continued.Paycom rose 0.8% to 53.55 intraday, hitting a new record high. Shares are still just within the 5% chase zone from a 51.07 entry point cleared on Feb. 9. Its RS line is below old highs, which is not a great sign, but it's not way off those prior levels.Paycom is a cloud-based HR and payroll processing firm, but it mostly focuses on small- to mid-size companies and thus doesn't compete much with Workday. Its competitors include Paylocity (PCTY), Ultimate Software (ULTI) and Paychex (PAYX).Paycom is a rare fast-growing cloud-based software firm: it's decidedly profitable. Fourth-quarter earnings rose 80%, the third straight quarter of decelerating growth but it was well above estimates. Paycom also guided 2017 sales higher. Paycom's Feb. 8 earnings fueled the 13.4% spike into buying range the following session.RELATED:Splunk rose to 66.46 intraday, briefly topping a 65.85 buy point and its highest point since November 2015. But the Big Data company closed up just 3 cents at 64.98.Revenue growth has slowed for the last four quarters to a still-strong 40% in its fiscal Q3, with earnings up 140%. The data analytics firm posted its last loss in fiscal Q1 ended in January 2016, with analysts expecting strong profit growth over the next two years.

235,PAYX,"Maybe the race wasn't to the swift during biblical times, but in the 21st century you'll get left behind in a hurry if you're slow out of the gate with new technologies.Rivals of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) are finding that out.Ultimate makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee-related services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.The core product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud.That last part — the cloud — is what separates Ultimate from others in its industry, analysts say. Ultimate was an early mover in designing an integrated, cloud-based human resources/payroll system, giving it a leg up on rivals who have taken longer to leverage the cloud.""As the move to the cloud has accelerated, Ultimate has been one of the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""They are taking a lot of customers away from ADP (ADP), Ceridian and Paychex (PAYX).""Clout Of The CloudCloud-based systems have several advantages over hardware-based systems, Samana told IBD.""There is a lower overall cost of ownership because you don't have to purchase hardware,"" he said. ""There's less staff cost in terms of management. And there are more frequent updates to the software, which helps you keep up with the pace of innovation.""Ultimate's ability to trot out new products and innovations has been one of the keys to its consistent financial growth through the years. The company posts double-digit sales and earnings gains with regularity and is expected to keep doing so well into the future.""The market for Ultimate's solutions is large and growing rapidly. The company has strong, highly regarded products, increasing scale, and a business model that better balances revenue growth and profitability than many SaaS (software as a service) peers,"" MKM Partners analyst Kevin Buttigieg noted in a report last month initiating coverage on Ultimate with a ""buy"" rating.Ultimate boasts 2,700 customers with employees in 150 countries. Its client list features a diverse range of firms, including software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE), restaurant operators Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), auto parts retailer Pep Boys (PBY) and Major League Baseball.Ultimate mainly focuses on two types of customers: enterprise companies, defined as those with more than 1,500 employees, and mid-market companies, or those with around 500 to 1,500 employees.Ultimate's enterprise sales team, which consists of 75 sales reps, has ""an unusually low turnover"" rate with an average tenure of 10 years, Barrington Research analyst Jeff Houston noted following Ultimate's third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28.He cites several reasons for the low turnover, including ""not penalizing successful salespeople by narrowing their territories as well as world-class benefits.""Winning BusinessDuring a conference call with analysts, Ultimate CEO Scott Scherr noted a number of enterprise wins during the company's third quarter, though he didn't divulge the names of the customers. These included a ""high-profile"" restaurant chain with 18,000 employees, a security company with 6,500 employees and an education services company with 3,600 employees.While most of Ultimate's business comes from large and mid-sized clients, the company has lately increased its efforts to land more smaller companies of 500 or fewer employees, analyst Houston says.""Management was clear that it has been selling to companies with fewer than 500 employees for a long time, and that it is just adding more salespeople to target the low end of the market,"" he noted.FBR's Samana reckons it will be some time before the move to land more smaller clients begins to have much impact on Ultimate's financial results.""The move downstream is a newer initiative for them, so it's something where we will see a bigger contribution a couple of years from now,"" he said. ""It's not as big a driver in the near term.""What About Job Gains?Although analyst Houston says Ultimate stands to benefit as the economy adds jobs, CEO Scherr mentioned on the third-quarter conference call that with new customers being Ultimate Software's biggest growth driver, changes in employment ""are not that material"" to the overall growth goal.During the third quarter the company logged revenue of $127.4 million, up 24% from the prior year and just ahead of consensus analyst views. Earnings gained 25% to 50 cents a share, topping estimates by a penny.Recurring revenue, or revenue that is likely to continue in the future, increased 26% during the quarter.""The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our cloud offering,"" Scherr said in a statement.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to post full-year 2014 earnings of $2.02 a share, up 26% from a year earlier. EPS is seen rising another 22% to $2.46 in 2015.The company's stock price touched a nearly eight-month high of 156.20 on Tuesday. Shares are up 20% since Oct. 10.Ultimate is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which ranks fifth in the group. Three stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 99: Manhattan Associates (MANH), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR).

261,PAYX,"Stocks still logged mild losses at lunchtime in New York on Monday. But Tesla Motors (TSLA) defied the decline after the leader in electric vehicles posted a much better than expected 70% boost in third-quarter deliveries.Tesla shares romped more than 4% higher to 212.79 and got as high as 215.67. Watch to see if the stock can now retake its 200-day moving average, which has been falling gradually since January.A continued strong move by Tesla would also send the stock above its midterm 50-day moving average and give bears some more chills. Typically, a great stock will trade above both the 50- and 200-day lines in preparing for a sound breakout and a big move.Tesla has shown it needs more time to digest its monster gains since initially breaking out to 52-week highs in the spring of 2013 near 40.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell 0.5% while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%. Volume was running lower on both main exchanges. The Nasdaq has scored three up weeks in a row.Procter & Gamble (PG) was among three Dow industrials components to fall 1 point or more, but the soap and shampoo giant is acting fine after clearing an 83.97 flat-base pattern at the end of June.Other vehicle makers also advanced. RV maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) did a wheelie of its own, spiking 25% to a multiyear high in huge volume, while peer Thor Industries (THO) gained nearly 1%. The former is acquiring towable recreational vehicle firm Grand Design in a $500 million cash and stock deal. Winnebago also announced preliminary earnings above analyst forecasts.Elsewhere in the stock market today, payrolls processor Paychex (PAYX) continued to struggle after last week's 3.4% slide, which was the stock's worst week since a 10% thrashing in the first week of the year. Shares fell more than 1% to 57.15. The stock is clearly in basing mode after posting weak bottom-line growth of just 3% in the August-ended fiscal first quarter. The stock is still holding on to a gain of nearly 9% since it broke out of a cup-with-handle pattern at 54.67 on June 2.It's critical in the CAN SLIM investment strategy to never let a decent gain — read 10% or higher — turn into a loss.Apple (AAPL) dipped 0.4% to 112.55, holding on to a gain of nearly 2% since its high-volume breakout past a 110.33 cup-with-handle entry on Sept. 14.A proper handle must form over a minimum five trading days; in Apple's case, the handle began with a mild reversal on Aug. 16 after hitting an intraday high of 110.23. Then it drifted lower over the next 17 sessions, falling just 7% in price. Notice how that decline not only met the maximum 12% drop permitted in a good handle, but that the decline was far less than the 20% correction of the cup portion of the pattern.The typical cup base among top winners researched by IBD shows a decline of around 20% to 25% from the cup's left-side high, but can extend as far as 30% to 35%.Apple's RS Rating continues to improve, yet is not quite at a level usually shown by the best stock markets leaders. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's RS Rating is 66 — below the average of 87 among top stocks at the start of their breakouts — yet that 66 is good enough for Apple to rank No. 5 for RS within the Telecom-Consumer Products industry group.RELATED:Will Tesla Form A Bottoming Base?Why Apple's Breakout Is Holding UpWhy Tesla Shares Look Healthiest In WeeksTesla's Q3 Orders Beat The Street; Musk Seeks More Cash

274,PAYX,"Leading stocks such as Amazon.com continued to flex their strength amid a mildly positive start in the market Wednesday. The e-commerce and online video giant added another 1% to 824 following Tuesday's 2% surge, and volume is already moving at five times its 50-day average levels.Amazon (AMZN), which was added to Leaderboard on March 29, when it closed near 593, has staged solid gains since breaking past a multiple number of entry points, the most recent of which was a second test of its rising 50-day moving average near 760.The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq composite also showed slight gains in the 0.1% to 0.2% range in the stock market today. The Nasdaq outperformed on Tuesday with its 0.9% advance, recouping virtually all of Monday's losses.Small caps gained a bit more ground early Wednesday; the Russell 2000 rose 0.3%. Crude oil futures rebounded more than 1.5% and back past the $45-a-barrel level, but natural gas sank. Amazon first etched a solid cup with handle pattern that formed after the stock hit a peak of 696.44 on Dec. 29 last year. The base actually yielded a pair of handles, which is totally possible when the initial breakout does not quite send the stock flying out of the base and into new high ground.As annotated on a Leaderboard daily chart, Amazon first broke out on April 13 by surpassing a 603.34 handle entry. A second handle formed as the stock fell mildly from April 19 to April 28, presenting another potential buy point at 638.11. Then on April 29, Amazon shares gapped up hard, rising more than 9% on the back of strong earnings and sales (up 28%, the biggest jump in four years) in the first quarter.Amazon has now gained nearly 37% from the first handle pivot point of 603.34.The Street sees Amazon's Q3 earnings vaulting 365% to 79 cents a share; in Q1, earnings were 1.07 a share vs. a net loss in the year-ago quarter, and Q2 profit soared 837% to $1.78 a share.Paychex (PAYX) fell more than 4% to 57.65 in heavy trading, sinking further below its 50-day moving average.

A rebound later in the month failed to keep the stock above the key support line for long.A majority of the Dow 30 stocks gained mildly, but Nike (NKE) dropped more than 1% to 54.51 on the back of light guidance on future orders. Management also said it would end the practice of providing such concrete guidance on future orders in light of its evolving product flows and business models. On the bright side, Nike's earnings of 73 cents a share, while up just 9% vs. a year ago, pounded the Street's consensus estimate of 56 cents.Also in the NYSE, Chinese e-commerce play Alibaba (BABA) initially gained more than 1% to 109.58 and reached as high as 109.87 before fading. It's now at the highest levels since Christmastime in 2014.Evidence of the stock's strength can be seen in how it ran past recent buy points without seemingly breaking a sweat. The first pivot point was 85.10, which Alibaba crossed rather diffidently on Aug. 9. But the breakout then went into full bloom the next three sessions as shares catapulted a combined 15% in heavy trade. It then formed another handle, easing lightly in price in quiet volume, ushering a new buy point at 98.96 — a dime above the handle's intraday high of 98.86 on Aug. 15.On the downside, restaurant chains continue to struggle amid concerns over fast-rising labor costs and dining spending patterns, influenced in part by new options such as on-demand prepared and unprepared food delivery services.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) is getting squashed with a third 1%-plus decline in a row, losing more than 3% to 38.30. In the process, the restaurant-cum-arcade chain lost support both at the 200-day moving average and at the 40 price level.

296,PAYX,"A common pitfall for new and experienced investors alike is to buy a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's ""acting right."" Fundamentals are top-notch, there's a compelling growth story, and the stock is in a bullish setup.Sometimes, the strategy works. Other times, it can end badly, especially if the stock gaps down on earnings.Buying shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) when it was in a cup-with-handle base ahead of its July 21 earnings report turned out to be the right call. Shares gapped up on the news. But it didn't work out with Mobileye (MBLY) recently when shares crashed 8% on the day it reported its quarterly results. The company delivered another strong quarter of earnings and sales growth, but news that the company would be ending its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) rattled investors.IBD recently introduced an options strategy to limit risk around earnings. The strategy provides a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the risk of a negative reaction to an earnings report. Weekly or monthly options can be used -- so long as the cost for the option is right.The options market might sound a bit daunting, but the strategy isn't complicated.First, look for stocks at or near proper buy points. Most will be building bases. After that, look for a slightly out-of-the-money weekly or monthly call option. This means the strike price is just above the underlying stock price. Every strike price comes with a premium, or the cost of the option. Divide the premium by the stock price, and multiply by 100; this gives you the downside risk for the trade in percentage form. Looks for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.The strategy is detailed every week in the Earnings Preview column of the IBD Weekly edition on page B2. Several stocks featured in recent weeks delivered nice options wins.One of the early winners was Nvidia (NVDA), featured in the May 9 edition of IBD Weekly as it got support at the 10-week moving average. When shares were trading around 35.50 on May 12, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 36 strike price (May 13 expiration) came with a premium of $1.27. That offered a trade with 3.6% downside risk.Shares gapped up May 13 on earnings and closed at 40.98. The option could have been exercised that day at 36. If you didn't want shares, you could have sold the option itself for a nice profit.Other winners in recent weeks included Salesforce.com (CRM), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), Paychex (PAYX), Yum Brands (YUM) and Domino's.Of course, earnings option plays aren't always going to work, but they're a lower-risk alternative to buying a stock outright ahead of earnings because risk is predefined.

Investors zeroed in on growth in its Azure cloud-based unit -- a priority for the company as it tries to stoke growth.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose 1.3% on the stock market today. Microsoft is the second-largest stock among 73 holdings in the portfolio of diversified technology companies.Top holding Apple (AAPL) reports Tuesday, but most investors are expecting fireworks. Apple stock has been hammered in the past year amid mounting worries about growth for its flagship iPhone products.Apple's woes have weighed on XLK, which lags several technology ETF peers year to date despite recovering along with the broad stock market since the Brexit low of June 27.This flagship tech exchange traded fund has risen 6.6% so far in 2016 through July 19. By comparison, Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology (RYT) is up 7.6% over the same period.Both ETFs track the technology sector of the S&P 500 index, but weight stocks in the portfolio differently.RYT gives each stock an equal stake in portfolio assets, thereby limiting the impact that dominant players in the sector -- such as Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL)-- have on returns. Apple accounts for less than 2% of portfolio assets in RYT vs. roughly 13% in the cap-weighted XLK.""Apple's and Alphabet's relatively weak performance in 2016 has dragged down XLK,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. He noted that both these stocks have far smaller weightings in RYT, benefiting its performance.RYT also benefited from more exposure to smaller, lesser-known names such as Paychex (PAYX) and Intuit (INTU) that performed better, he pointed out.Apple is the only top 10 stock in XLK with a double-digit negative return in the past year, down 21%. Microsoft is up 17% and Facebook (FB) 27% over the same period.XLK holds $12.31 billion in total assets.IBD'S TAKE: Apple shares are rising but its Relative Price Strength Rating is a lowly 19.

301,PAYX,"Paychex (PAYX), a leading provider of payroll services to small and midsize businesses, has resumed dividend increases amid a rebound in sales and profit.The company began raising the quarterly payout in 2011 after holding it steady at 31 cents a share for three years. The latest increase came in August, a hike of 2 cents, or 6%, to 35 cents a share.The annual dividend is now $1.40 per share, which yields 3.6% at the current share price. That's well above the S&P 500 average of 2.56%. Meanwhile, the stock has risen 29% this year, also easily outpacing the S&P.Paychex is benefiting from slowly rising U.S. employment and expansion into Germany, Europe's biggest economy, and South America. It's also expanding product offerings.The Rochester, N.Y.-based company recently formed a partnership with Canada-based Kashoo, which develops accounting software for small businesses that can be downloaded from the Internet.Paychex's profit and sales have been rising at a slow but steady pace for the past 13 quarters following a series of declines amid the 2008-09 recession.On Sept. 30, Paychex posted a better-than-expected 5% gain in profit for the latest quarter. Sales rose 3% to $597.9 million, and the company reiterated its 2014 outlook.The stock's three-year Earnings Stability Factor is 1 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable).Meanwhile, pretax margin rose for three straight years, to a robust 39.2% in 2012.

Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) hiked payouts after the Federal Reserve OK'd their capital plans in the second round of stress tests. Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing. With the ruling, GE will no longer have to follow minimum capital and liquidity requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) label was put on GE Capital in 2013. But since then General Electric has slashed GE Capital assets as it refocuses on its industrial core.GE shares rose 5.6% to 31.49, near a 32.15 buy point.The ISM manufacturing index rose 1.9 points in June to 53.2, its best reading in 15 months. The new orders and production subindexes showed solid gains. The employment measure rose 1.2 points to 50.4, the first positive reading of 2016. The export orders gauge rose to its best level since late 2014.

But sales slightly missed views with a 6% gain to $8.24 billion, the third straight quarter to miss revenue estimates. Currency-neutral global futures orders rose 11%, below estimates. Nike sees high-single-digit reported revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Q1 guidance disappointed. But analysts broadly remain bullish on Nike's long-term story, and management assured on the earnings call that inventory levels were ""clean"" and its basketball business was strong.Nike named Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook as its lead independent director late Thursday. Founder Phil Knight is stepping down as chairman.Nike shares rose 5.7% for the week.Volkswagen agreed to an estimated $14.7 billion in buybacks and fixes for diesel engine models sold in the U.S. after earlier admitting that it had altered software in them to cheat on emissions tests. But the problem is far from resolved. The world's largest automaker still faces multiple lawsuits. And after Volkswagen confirmed the U.S. settlement, Europe's Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska called on Volkswagen to offer similar compensation to VW buyers in Europe, Reuters reported. Volkswagen fell 2.6% for the week.Tesla Motors confirmed late Thursday that regulators are probing a fatal crash of a Model S operating in self-driving mode. The news could have negative implications for autonomous driving broadly. But Tesla still rose 2% on Friday and 12.1% for the week, closing just below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.Mobileye (MBLY), which makes driver-assistance camera systems for Tesla and many others, announced an alliance with BMW and Intel (INTC) on Friday to produce a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021.

Stifel called the move ""appropriately defensive,"" given the movie industry's volatility, among other factors. The deal brings Lions Gate a rival to Time Warner (TWX) premium channel HBO. Lions Gate fell 3.9% to 19.45, while Starz jumped 3.35% to 29.67.Hershey (HSY): The chocolate giant rejected an unsolicited $107-a-share bid from snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ), saying it sees no basis for further talks.

Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping.

ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations.

511,PAYX,"Investors looking for stocks in the Outsourcing sector might want to consider either Sykes Enterprises (SYKE  -  Free Report) or Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Both Sykes Enterprises and Paychex have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.SYKE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.74, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 24.45. We also note that SYKE has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.98.Another notable valuation metric for SYKE is its P/B ratio of 1.60. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 12.26.These metrics, and several others, help SYKE earn a Value grade of A, while PAYX has been given a Value grade of F.Both SYKE and PAYX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that SYKE is the superior value option right now.

512,PAYX,"Outsourcing is the business of transferring the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis. The buoyancy in the outsourcing space is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank in the top 37% (95 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stocks — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.

Shares of Broadridge have gained 53% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%. Paychex, despite rallying 20.9% in the same time frame, underperformed both Broadridge and the industry it belongs to. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Paychex’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 11.3% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  For 2019, Paychex’s earnings are expected to register 10.9% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge.Thus, Paychex has an edge over Broadridge in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge has performed better than Paychex, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 23.6%. Paychex delivered a positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 1.2%.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 27.6%, Paychex not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and Paychex is 28.5 and 27.9, respectively, while that of the industry is 27.5. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Paychex has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge scores over Paychex in terms of price performance and earnings surprise history. Paychex, however, has an edge in terms of expected earnings growth and net margin. Although both companies carry a Zacks Rank #2, Broadridge, with a better style score, has a higher probability of success in the near term. However, a faster share price rally in the past year has led to a relatively rich valuation for Broadridge compared to Paychex.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

This upside is expected to be driven by strength across the company’s human capital management (HCM) services including HR, retirement and insurance services. HRS revenues rose 17.1% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Retirement services revenues are likely to benefit from an increase in the number of plans served.

Shares the professional services and management consulting firm have also trended in the right direction, up 31% over the last year.However, ACN is currently a Zacks Ranks #4 (Sell) based mostly on the fact that its quarterly earnings picture has trended in the wrong direction recently—with the most recent analyst estimates coming in slightly below our current $1.71 per share consensus.

515,PAYX,"Investors interested in stocks from the Outsourcing sector have probably already heard of Sykes Enterprises (SYKE  -  Free Report) and Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Sykes Enterprises is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Paychex has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that SYKE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.SYKE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.49, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 25.15. We also note that SYKE has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.07.Another notable valuation metric for SYKE is its P/B ratio of 1.58. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 12.20.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SYKE's Value grade of A and PAYX's Value grade of C.SYKE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that SYKE is likely the superior value option right now.

522,PAYX,"Paylocity Holding (PCTY  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 220.1%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 22% and a market cap of $3.03 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to retain in their portfolio if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Paylocity, a provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management (HCM) software solutions, is gaining from its regular investments in SaaS technology.Over the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company’s top line.Notably, Paylocity stock has gained 30.2% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 27.7%.We believe that accelerated adoption of the company’s robust portfolio has aided the company’s financials. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s revenues came in at $113.4 million, reflecting an increase of 25.6% year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $111 million.Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Paylocity Holding Corporation QuoteApart from the organic enrichment of the portfolio, management is extremely optimistic about the acquisition of BeneFLEX. This new buyout has added a host of benefit administration related solutions and is expected to drive its revenues further.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from existing players like Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Paychex, Inc., (PAYX  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) among others remains a major headwind. Increasing competition from new entrants also remains a threat.

Total earnings are expected to be up 23.6% on revenue growth of 8.8%, per the latest Earnings Outlook report. This is much higher than 13.4% earnings growth and 8.1% revenue growth recorded in Q4.The bullish projection for the quarter have been attributed to factors like the corporate tax overhaul apart from an improving economy and a much-improved job market.Per the report, 444 S&P 500 members have reported quarterly results.

Lower corporate and individual tax rates along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target.Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in April and the overall economy grew for the 108th consecutive month. U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in April as the PMI measured by ISM touched 57.3%. This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 20th consecutive month, driven by continued increase in new orders, production activity and employment and inventories. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 reported growth in April.The employment index grew 54.2% in April, which indicates employment growth for the 19th consecutive month. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 12 reported employment growth.

While the Prices Index gained 0.3% to 61.8%, Employment Index declined 3% to 536%.

527,PAYX,"The Business Services sector has performed well compared with the benchmark index year to date. The sector has gained 10.6%, which compares favorably with the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s rally of 4.4% in the said time frame. The outlook of the business services sector is highly dependent on the health of the broader economy. The overall U.S. economy is benefiting from Trump administration’s business-friendly approach, including tax cuts, higher spending and repeal of regulations. This has improved the employment scenario, and aided manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities.Robust Manufacturing & Non-Manufacturing ActivityThe business services sector is gaining strength because it is firmly tied to manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities.The manufacturing sector grew for the 22nd consecutive month, reporting a PMI of 60.2% in June. The growth was driven by increased activity across production, supplier deliveries, inventories, customers’ inventories and export and import orders. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 reported growth in June.Additionally, the manufacturing gauge logged its biggest gain in the last four months and surpassed the average PMI level of 59.0% in the past year.As far as the non-manufacturing sector is concerned, NMI was 59.1% in June, recording the 101st consecutive month of expansion. This expansion was driven by continued increase in business activity, new orders and new export orders. Out of the 18 non-manufacturing industries, 17 reported growth in June.The non-manufacturing gauge also reported its highest gain in the past four months, higher than the average NMI level of 57.9% in the past year.Highest Jobs Additions in JunePer the latest data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the professional and business services sector reported the highest job additions in June among all industries. The sector added 50,000 jobs in June and 521,000 in the past 12 months. The figures show improvement from the previous month’s addition of 31,000 jobs and 483,000 jobs in a year.Other significant gainers include manufacturing (36,000), healthcare (25,200), leisure & hospitality (25,000), education (18,900) and construction (13,000). Retail however lost 21,600 jobs.The overall economy added 213,000 jobs in June, registering growth of 2.4 million in the past year. Monthly job additions (revised) have averaged 211,000 in the past three months.GDP Projections UpDespite declining to an annualized pace of 2% in the first quarter of 2018, U.S. GDP is expected to register 3.8% growth in the second quarter, per the Atlanta Federal Reserve. The BlueChip economists’ estimate an average GDP growth of 3.5% in the second quarter. Moreover, U.S. GDP is expected to register 2.93% growth for full year 2018, per a report by statista.Given this bullish estimate, we believe the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters. Income tax cuts and increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target.What’s in Store for the Sector in Q2?The Business Services sector is expected to register earnings growth of 15.4% on 5.4% higher revenues in second-quarter 2018, per the latest Earnings Preview report. Additionally, the sector is one of the 11 (out of the total 16) Zacks sectors expected to register double-digit earnings growth in second-quarter 2018. Total second-quarter 2018 earnings are expected to be up 19% on 8.2% higher revenues.Top Four Gainers in JuneWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four promising stocks from the sector, which have grown in June and have the potential to rise further in the second half of the year.

528,PAYX,"Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report), a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ExpansionCintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one million business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24.

Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3.

529,PAYX,"Tuesday, April 3, 2018This week started with a big sell-off Monday, including a 3% drop in the Dow midday. From there we saw some value buying, but it’s clear volatility remains with us in the present-day markets. We would be hard pressed to blame anywhere but the U.S. indexes, as Europe took Monday off in observation of the Easter holiday. Overnight, Japan’s Nikkei index fell 0.5%, likely in response to yesterday’s red numbers here at home.Pre-market futures are up at this hour after closing below the 200-day moving average yesterday, erasing the Nasdaq’s gains for the whole of 2018 thus far. In fact, early trading looks to dig out of “correction territory” today, with the Dow +121, Nasdaq +71 and S&P 500 +20. Whether we can hold these numbers is contingent on a wide spectrum of news items we’ve yet to see. At this point, many analysts are expecting merely a “dead cat bounce,” meaning a period of buying back even thought the trading cycle remains bearish, at least near-term.This is also the week we get to look at new jobs numbers, with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector report coming out ahead of the bell tomorrow and the big Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll numbers hitting the tape Friday morning. For February, we could not have possibly seen a more “Goldilocks” scenario: 300K+ new jobs with only moderate wage increases, meaning the labor market continues to tighten without a noteworthy spike in wages, which would be a big contributor to overall economic inflation.On CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) CEO Martin Mucci reported small businesses experienced a pullback in jobs for the month of March. Mucci pointed toward the tight labor market itself as the reason small businesses have had difficulty finding enough skilled workers to fill the jobs available, at least for firms with fewer than 50 employees. Phoenix remained the top city for wage growth, and Tennessee won the top state for small business growth overall. We shall see if this reported pullback makes it into the date we expect later this week.Tesla’s Other Shoe DropsAs expected, Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) reported its production and deliveries for last month, posting 8180 new Teslas delivered in March. For the past week, 2020 new Teslas were produced — beneath the original guidance of 2500 per week, but better than many of the Tesla bears had been anticipating. Shares of the electric car leader are up nearly 3% in today’s pre-market, after tumbling in excess of 5% Monday.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Non-cash goodwill impairment charges and expenses related to business transformation are likely to hurt the bottom line.We observe that shares of Stericycle have declined 31.5% in the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 2.7%.Revenue Expectations The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for first-quarter 2018 stands at $885.15 million, reflecting year-over-year decline of 0.8%. We expect the company to witness top line contraction on the back of lower organic revenue growth and unfavorable impact of divestures.In fourth-quarter 2017, revenues declined 2.1% year over year to $887.8 million (inclusive of $10.2 million reduction in revenues due to divestitures and a loss of 2.6% of organic revenues). However, acquisitions had a positive impact of $6.8 million.Earnings to Decline Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.04 per share, indicating year-over-year decline of 4.6%.The company’s earnings are likely to be negatively impacted by non-cash goodwill impairment charges and expenses related to business transformation. These headwinds are expected to offset the tax benefits from the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).In fourth-quarter 2017, adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share remained flat with the prior-year quarter. The company witnessed a tax benefit (as a result of lower tax) of $129.8 million.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if the companies are witnessing negative estimate revisions.

531,PAYX,"We often lose sight of these things once we’re in the thick of earnings season, like we are now, but this happens to be Jobs Week. With the Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector report coming out for the month of April tomorrow, and the all-important Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report on Friday. But on CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, Martin Mucci of Paychex, Inc.

This would indicate that those massive corporate tax cuts we saw at the end of 2017 have yet to hit small businesses, or it might be an indication that we might not expect our overall jobs numbers to be notably affected by those tax cuts, after all.Arizona showed the best annual hourly earnings growth, and Denver was once again the top city for overall jobs growth. Phoenix topped in small business wages increasing, and Tennessee was the state that saw the largest gains in small business employment overall. Manufacturing was up in the month for small businesses, while Leisure/Hospitality came out on top in hourly earnings growth. Overall, for the month, wage growth for small businesses was up marginally.As far as Q1 earnings season goes, after the bell today we expect results from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), among many others.

533,PAYX,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether or not this provider of payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.77%.What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model shows that Paychex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock fulfils the Zacks criteria of a positive Earnings ESP, and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Paychex has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at 61 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 10.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $854.8 million, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteLet’s now discuss the influencing factors in detail.Factors to ConsiderStrong domain expertise in human capital-management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services are expected to increase the company’s clientele and drive revenues.The company’s product launches and joint-venture initiatives are additional positives. Its investments toward building the sales team, which eventually assists in client addition and revenue generation, is a major tailwind.Notably, during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company’s solutions were adopted by the International Franchise Association (IFA) for providing payroll services for IFA membership.We also believe Paychex’s inorganic growth strategies are also proving conducive to its growth. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, the company has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters.However, a declining client retention rate is affecting the company’s financials. Additionally, heightening competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Insperity, Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report) and DST System is another key concern.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

534,PAYX,"Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report), a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ExpansionCintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3.

535,PAYX,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 results wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line came in line with the same. However, the company registered year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Non-GAAP earnings per share of 59 cents increased 5% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the stock has returned 10.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming 7% growth recorded by the industry.Quarter DetailsPaychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $826.5 million, up 7% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) were up 7% year over year to $812.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $823 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 1% from the year-ago period to $444.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check, which benefited from price increases and net of discounts. However, revenues were negatively impacted by a change in client base mix.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 15% year over year to $367.7 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base across the prominent human capital management (HCM) services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% on a year-over-year basis to $14 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex’s total expenses rose 7% from the year-ago quarter to $494.3 million due to increased investments in technology and combined PEO business. Acquisition of HROI accounted for 5% of the total increase in expenses. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 20 basis points (bps) to 59.8%.Operating income grew 7% year over year to $332.2 million. However, Paychex’s operating margin decreased 10 bps to 40.2%.Adjusted net income surged 8% year over year to $437.2 million.Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $338.6 million compared with $323.4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. For the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $519.4 million.During the first two quarters, Paychex repurchased 1.6 million shares for $94.1 million. GuidanceThe guidance for fiscal 2018 provided at the end of the first quarter remains unaltered.Total revenues are expected to grow around 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.35 billion.Payroll Services Revenues are anticipated surge between 1% and 2%.Human Resource Services revenues are projected to grow in the range of 12-14%.Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39% and 40%. Effective income tax rate, excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation, is projected to be 35.0% to 35.5%.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Net income is still likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Our TakeThe company’s top-line is benefiting from acquisitions. In the second quarter fiscal 2018, HROI which was acquired in August 2017, added 3% to total service revenue growth.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company’s payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing decision making in the mid-market, affected the company’s client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corp.

Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Our TakeIn the fiscal first quarter, Paychex’s earnings and revenues both surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the year-over-year improvement on both counts is encouraging. Furthermore, the company’s upbeat revenue guidance for the fiscal is impressive.Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth boost our optimism. We also believe the company’s expansion initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, will likely support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Also, Paychex’s focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) remain key concerns.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Synaptics Inc.

539,PAYX,"This week started with a big sell-off Monday, including a 3% drop in the Dow midday. From there we saw some value buying, but it’s clear volatility remains with us in the present-day markets. We would be hard pressed to blame anywhere but the U.S. indexes, as Europe took Monday off in observation of the Easter holiday. Overnight, Japan’s Nikkei index fell 0.5%, likely in response to yesterday’s red numbers here at home.Pre-market futures are up at this hour after closing below the 200-day moving average yesterday, erasing the Nasdaq’s gains for the whole of 2018 thus far. In fact, early trading looks to dig out of “correction territory” today, with the Dow +121, Nasdaq +71 and S&P 500 +20. Whether we can hold these numbers is contingent on a wide spectrum of news items we’ve yet to see. At this point, many analysts are expecting merely a “dead cat bounce,” meaning a period of buying back even thought the trading cycle remains bearish, at least near-term.This is also the week we get to look at new jobs numbers, with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector report coming out ahead of the bell tomorrow and the big Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll numbers hitting the tape Friday morning. For February, we could not have possibly seen a more “Goldilocks” scenario: 300K+ new jobs with only moderate wage increases, meaning the labor market continues to tighten without a noteworthy spike in wages, which would be a big contributor to overall economic inflation.On CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) CEO Martin Mucci reported small businesses experienced a pullback in jobs for the month of March. Mucci pointed toward the tight labor market itself as the reason small businesses have had difficulty finding enough skilled workers to fill the jobs available, at least for firms with fewer than 50 employees. Phoenix remained the top city for wage growth, and Tennessee won the top state for small business growth overall. We shall see if this reported pullback makes it into the date we expect later this week.Tesla’s Other Shoe DropsAs expected, Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) reported its production and deliveries for last month, posting 8180 new Teslas delivered in March. For the past week, 2020 new Teslas were produced — beneath the original guidance of 2500 per week, but better than many of the Tesla bears had been anticipating. Shares of the electric car leader are up nearly 3% in today’s pre-market, after tumbling in excess of 5% Monday.
"
540,PAYX,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%. Notably, over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe are positive about Accenture’s latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe these will have a positive influence on the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner gave some optimism about Accenture’s near-term performance. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to grow 2.4% to $3.48 trillion, marking a solid recovery after two consecutive years of decline.The research firm noted two major catalysts which, it believes, will drive IT spending this year. The first catalyst highlighted by Gartner is decline in the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies. Secondly, the firm foresees an uptick in digital transformation projects in the near term, which will enable organizations to spend more on IT related infrastructure, products, and services. All these encourage us about the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter overall performance.Nonetheless, Accenture’s February 2017 announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. The company has already started to work on this space, by opening two innovation centers and hiring people over there.The company is believed to be preparing itself for a more protectionist U.S. technology-visa program under President Trump. It should be noted that out of more than 394,000 of its total workforce, 140,000 are in India, which provides it a cost advantage. With the addition of 15,000 new jobs, Accenture’s total employee count in the United States will increase by 30% to 65,000, thereby increasing its salary expenses significantly.Additionally, heightening competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.46 on $9-billion revenue projection.Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Accenture’s Earnings ESP is -0.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% and a Zacks Rank #2.

541,PAYX,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) appears to be striving to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry. In this regard, the payroll and human resource solutions provider recently acquired Charlotte, NC-based HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (HROI) for an undisclosed amount.Founded in 2001, HROI is a well know name in the PEO industry, which, along with its subsidiaries, offers human resource solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in over 35 states across the U.S. Importance of HROI Buyout A PEO is a firm or company to which organizations can outsource their HR functions, including payroll and benefits administration. The benefits offered by a PEO make it a viable choice for organizations.The most important benefit is that an organization gets full administrative support without investing in technology and employees. Apart from this, a PEO takes care of all aspects of an employee’s tenure. Organizations get trained representatives who can better address their HR related matters. Moreover, the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non-core activities is growing.Therefore, in our opinion, the acquisition is a strategic fit for Paychex as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in-house HR management departments. Also, both the companies have similar target customers,  small and medium-sized businesses.As of May 31, 2017, Paychex had nearly 605,000 payroll clients but the market is still highly untapped. Per the company, there are about 12 million businesses in the U.S. under its total addressable market, half of which are still untapped.The recent buyout of HROI will expand its services, thereby helping it to add to its customer base.Bottom LineThe company’s initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Since its inception, the company has completed 13 acquisitions of which eight were under the leadership of current president and CEO, Martin Mucci.These buyouts have helped the company to expand its services as well as global reach, thereby boosting its revenues. Notably, in the last five fiscals, i.e. 2012 to 2017, the company has seen its revenues rise at a CAGR of 7.2%.Going ahead, one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost saving potential.The company seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by periodically introducing products and services for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid-market.However, for the last few months, payroll client growth has been affected by political uncertainty, which in turn is impacting outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market. This was highlighted by Paychex during its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 conference call.This makes us sceptical about the company’s near-term performance. Intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) could add to its woes.Paychex has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the last year. The stock has lost 8% of its value in the said period while the industry declined just 1.3%.Currently, Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

542,PAYX,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Mar 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this online financial data-related products and services provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, its results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate each time, with an average positive surprise of 1.2%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter is pegged at $2.05, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 13.3%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $334.8 million, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe company is consistent with product innovation across segments with special emphasis on financial services to gain customers. Moreover, the company’s acquisitions with the likes of BISAM Technologies and Interactive Data have enhanced its product suite and have helped expand its international footprint. It will also help FactSet to maximize value for partners and provide exclusive content set. All this will continue to aid the company in gaining new customers, thereby driving the fiscal second-quarter top-line performance.Furthermore, the company is one of the leading providers of online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community. According to technavio, the Global Business Information market is projected to witness CAGR of 5.2% from 2017 to 2021. FactSet, being one of the key data providers, is expected to capitalize this opportunity and increase share in new markets.However, the company has been suffering from a declining client-retention ratio. During the fiscal first quarter, the retention ratio came in at 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the previous quarter. It should be noted that a strong client retention ratio signifies more stable revenues. Therefore, although the company has been adding new clients every quarter, its failure to retain existing clients is a concern.Moreover, the company caters to a highly competitive industry. With prominent peers such as Bloomberg L.P., Dow Jones & Company Inc. and Thomson Reuters (TRI  -  Free Report), competition is likely to intensify. While FactSet has a technological advantage, some of these competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources.FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FactSet Research Systems Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that FactSet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Also, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.22%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Influencing FactorsPaychex is a provider of payroll and integrated human resource, and employee benefits outsourcing solutions. It caters to the small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB) in the United States and is expected to continue benefiting from its strong domain expertise, going ahead.In fact, Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are impressive. Also, product launches and joint venture initiatives in a less-than-half-penetrated market are encouraging.Meanwhile, the company’s top-line continues to be boosted by its inorganic growth strategies. In this context, Paychex’s acquisition of HROI in August is worth mentioning. This is because this buyout is expected to drive this payroll and human resource solutions provider’s clientele and revenues.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company’s payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market affected the company’s client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Paychex, Inc.

544,PAYX,"On Dec 12, we issued an updated research report on Paychex, Inc.

Further, product launches and joint venture initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth. Also, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Notably, the company’s initiatives to enrich its product portfolio via acquisitions have also proved beneficial. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, Paychex has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters.Paychex, Inc.

The stock has gained 10.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 6.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.The outperformance can be accredited to the company’s expanding customer base and its solid domain expertise in human capital management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services.Paychex’s sustained focus on investing in product development and enhancing sales force capabilities is helping it to add customers, thereby supporting revenue growth. Notably, revenues witnessed 5-year (2012-2017) CAGR of 7.2%.

546,PAYX,"Shares of Paycom Software, Inc.

Also, reported earnings increased from 15 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Further, shares of Paycom Software have surged a whopping 88.1% in the past one year, outperforming the industry‘s increase of just 23.1%.Quarter DetailsPaycom Software reported revenues of $101.3 million, which increased 30.9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $100 million. The year-over-over increase can be attributedto the addition of new clients, new business wins and product development initiatives.Moreover, revenues were impacted positively by 31.2% increase in recurring revenues and approximately 21.9% increase in implementation and other revenues on a year-over-year basis.The company’s adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 84%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Paycom Software’s adjusted EBITDA increased 69% year over year to $30.7 million. Adjusted operating margins during the quarter came in 30.3% as compared with 23.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, total administration expenses decreased to 58.5% during the quarter from 63.5% reported in the year-ago period.Non-GAAP net income came in at $16.9 million compared with $8.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowPaycom Software exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $66.6 million compared with $68.1 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.4 million as compared with $1.8 million reported in the previous quarter.The company’s balance sheet comprises long-term debt of $33.2 million compared with $33.5 million reported in the previous quarter. It reported cash flow from operations of $92.4 million during nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.During the quarter, Paycom Software repurchased stocks worth $50 million. Moreover, the company authorized an additional share repurchase program, increasing the amount to $75 million.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Paycom Software expects revenues in a range of $111.5-$113.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $113.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately in the range of $26-$28 million.Paycom Software updated fiscal 2017 guidance.

Adjusted EBITDA is now anticipated to be approximately in a range of $131-$133 million (previously $122.5-$124.5 million).Our TakePaycom Software reported stellar third-quarter 2016 results and provided modest fourth-quarter guidance. The company also updated fiscal 2017 revenue guidance. Also, both the top line and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software’s Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind in the long run. Further, the company might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues, going forward.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report), Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) and Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) remains a headwind.Currently, Paycom Software carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

547,PAYX,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Notably, the stock has returned 9.9% in the last three months, outperforming 7.3% growth recorded by the industry.Growth DriversThere were a plenty of reasons behind the company’s upsurge, which includes a better-than-expected first-quarter result and upbeat fiscal 2018 guidance.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11% year over year. The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues and efficient cost management.Paychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $816.8 million, up 4% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) ascended 4% year over year to $803.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $816 million.Buoyed by splendid fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised revenue outlook. The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6%, up from the previous estimate of 5%.

549,PAYX,"We expect FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 26. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.54%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that FactSet Research is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Positive Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.90 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.89 per share), is pegged at +0.43%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold):Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of FactSet Research’s Zacks Rank #3 and +0.43% ESP makes us reasonably confident about an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FactSet Research Systems Inc. QuoteWhat is Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?The company is consistent with product innovation across segments with special emphasis on financial services to gain customers. Moreover, the company’s acquisitions of Portware, Revere Data, Matrix Data, Code Red and BISAM Technologies S.A will enhance product suite and aid it to evolve as a global financial database company. It will also help FactSet to maximize value for partners and provide exclusive content set.FactSet has a high client retention ratio which is another positive. The share repurchase program is anticipated to support earnings in the long run apart from boosting shareholder value.Furthermore, the company is one of the leading providers of online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community. According to ReportsnReports, the Global Business Information market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.15% from 2014 to 2019. FactSet, being one of the key data providers, is expected to gain a competitive edge through its technological know-how and increasing share in new markets.Overall, we expect to witness an earnings beat from FactSet Research this time around.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture PLC (ACN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Thor Industries, Inc.

550,PAYX,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 23.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMicron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices. So far, the fiscal 2017 has been marvellous for the company.In the last reported quarter, Micron’s top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as marked tremendous year-over-year growth, primarily due to pricing improvement in DRAM and NAND sales volume.We believe that the improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make investors confident about Micron’s growth. Per various sources, prices for these specific chips have improved chiefly due to a better product-mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.We believe that any elevation in prices will have a favorable influence on the company’s top line, the benefit of which will likely trickle down to the bottom line. The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company’s last quarterly results as well. We anticipate these benefits to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.83 on $5.95-billion revenue projection.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise         Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteAdditionally, we are positive about the company’s strategy of enhancing its operating capabilities through acquisitions which are likely to boost its top-line performance.Also, it is worth mentioning that the buyout of Inotera in December 2016 will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could heighten competition in the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Micron will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Micron’s Earnings ESP is -0.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report), has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%, and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% and a Zacks Rank #2.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

(ADP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 66 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. The figure included tax benefit of a penny related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance.Earnings declined 4.3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to company’s Service Alignment Initiative. However, revenues of $3.07 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 billion and grew 5.7% on a year-over-year basis.ADP reported revenues of $12.4 billion in fiscal 2017, which grew 6% over fiscal 2016 and was in line with management’s guidance. Organically, the growth was 7%.ADP’s stock has gained 3.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry it belongs to. The outperformance can be attributed to consistent revenue performance and improving operational efficiency.Moreover, ADP’s fiscal 2018 guidance forecasts new business bookings to increase 5% to 7% against a 5% decline in fiscal 2017. The Service Alignment will boost results going forward, which will eventually help the stock to maintain its momentum in the long run. Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
